 The Dance of Death: A Historical Overview

The Dance of Death, a favorite subject in the Dark Ages, depicted death leading all ranks and conditions of men to the grave. One of the most ancient still-existing depictions is the one found in the churchyard formerly belonging to the Convent of Dominicans in Basel, Switzerland. This painting was said to have been commissioned by the fathers and prelates of the grand council at Basel in 1431, in memory of a plague that occurred soon after. The name of the painter is unknown, but it has been suggested that Hans Klauber may have been involved, as his name appears in the lines addressed by Death to the Painter.

The Basel painting has been frequently regarded as the first of its kind, but this is doubtful due to the knowledge of many other works of equal antiquity. Many bridges in Germany and Switzerland were ornamented in this manner, and it is probable that almost every church of eminence was decorated with a Dance of Death. Paintings can still be seen in the cloisters of St. Innocent's church in Paris, the old Cathedral of St. Paul in London, and St. Mary's church in Berlin.

At Klingenthal, a convent in the Little Basel, are the remains of a Dance of Death, differently designed from that at the Dominicans, and thought to be more ancient. The figures remaining in Hungerford's chapel in the Cathedral at Salisbury, known by the title of Death and the Young Man, were undoubtedly part of a Dance's Dance, as might be further instigated on from the fragment of another compartment which was close to them. In the church at Hexham, in Northumberland, there are the remains of a Dance of Death; and at Fécamps, in Normandy, it is carved in stone, between the pillars of a church. The figures are about 18 inches high. Even fragments of painted glass, where this subject has been depicted, with old English verses over the figures, may contribute to show how very common it has been in our own country.

PC. Hilscher, in a tract printed at Dresden in 1705, has taken notice of other Dances of Death in various cities, such as Annaberg, Leipzig, and Berne. Dr. NUGENT has described one in St. Mary's church at Lübeck, which he states to have been painted in 1463. The origin of these may be sought in an ancient pageant, or religious farce, invented by the clergy for the purpose of entertaining and keeping the people in ignorance. In this, all ranks and conditions of life were personated and mixed together in a humorous way.

The earliest allusion to the subject, though it is uncertain if it refers to the farce or the paintings, is in the following lines from the visions of Pierce the plowman, who wrote about 1350:

"Me z. Death came driving after, and all to dust; kings and courtiers, knights and popes, learned and lewd, he let no man stand. He hit them even, he never stopped." Many a lovely lady and knight fell, sweating and toiling, for the dread of death's dints.

When the arts of printing and engraving became established, various copies of the Dance of Death appeared, particularly in the Hours, Breviaries, Missals, and other service books of the church, which were unaccompanied with a Dance of Death. Many of our own service books for the use of Salisbury were thus decorated, and the fashion eventually terminated in a book of Christian prayers, printed more than once during the reign of Elizabeth, since which time nothing of the kind has appeared.

In all these, the same dull and uniform representation of Death leading a single figure can be found, until at length, in 1538, a book titled "Les Simulacres & Histories Faces de la Mort; autant elegam- ent pourtraictes, que artificiellement ima- ginees" was printed at Lyons by Melchior and Gaspard Trechsel. It is accompanied by forty-one of the most beautiful groups of figures that can be conceived, both for their composition and execution, being delicately cut on wood and surpassing in this branch of art almost everything that has appeared before or since.

This work was often republished, in French, Latin, and Italian languages. The following is a tolerably correct list of the various editions:

2. Imagines de morte. Svea 1542. 12mo.

Patin, in his travels, also speaks of a house at Basel, curiously painted by Holbein, but does not mention the subject; it was probably the same as Burnet saw. The two are the only travelers who have spoken about this subject with any degree of accuracy, and fortunately their testimony throws much light upon it. [To the book already mentioned to have been published by the Trechels, at Lyons, they sometimes annexed another, which was] Cc 18 ON THE DANCE OF DEATH. [in some degree connected with it, and appears to have been printed by them the following year. This was entitled, ‘Historiarum veteris testamenti icones,’ the cuts of which are in some instances much inferior to the others, and apparently by a different artist. The designs of these are indisputably by Holbein, as appears from some verses before the book, composed by Nicolas Bourbon, a contemporary poet, who also wrote some lines upon a Dance of Death; painted by Holbein]. To ‘the [above mentioned] cuts to the Bible, are prefixed the first four which occur in the Dance of Death, as they likewise belong to the subject, and represent the creation and fall of man; but they are different in size, and were added, not only from the analogy of the subjects, but from the circumstance of their being already in the hands of the printer; and thus, from an odd coincidence of things, as well as a palpable confusion of the respective verses of Bourbon, seems to have originated an opinion that Holbein invented the Dance of Death. But it has not only been asserted that Holbein designed, but that he engraved, or rather cut this Dance of Death on wood. That he practiced this art, nay that he excelled in it, there is reason to believe, from some specimens that have been preserved, and which bear on them the unequivocal marks C2 PSS * RS 5 20 ON THE DANCE OF DEATH, of H. H. & HANS. HOLBEN, A set of cuts with the latter mark occurs in Archbishop Cranmer’s Catechism, printed by Walter Lyne in 1548; and although the composition of these is extremely good, their execution is not only inferior to the Dance of Death, but entirely different in its manner: and the mark of HB which is to be seen upon one of the cuts in this latter work, has been ascribed without any authority to Holbein, upon the strength of the vague opinion. However, it is reasonable to believe that Holbein, ‘in his pets’, might only intend to show that he designed them, or drew the subject upon the blocks. There are several instances concerning his interference with the Dance of Death. The great popularity and success of the cuts very soon excited many imitations of them both in copper and on blocks. In 1541, Aldegrever engraved eight of them, but with very material alterations. Other editions of the Imagines Mortis, which had been first published under that title in 1545, appeared in 1555, 1566, 1573, and probably at many other times; they were also accompanied with cuts in wood by a very eminent but unknown artist, whose mark is A. This mark is also to be found in some of the emblems of Sambucus and Lejeune, in some initial letters to Grafton’s Chronicle, and in other cuts executed during the sixteenth century. The Inaccurate Papillon, who is hardly ever to be trusted in matters of historical discussion, has asserted in his "48 Traité de la gravure en bois" that this is the mark of Silvius Antonianus, or Antoniano. Upon finding it on some cuts in an edition of Faerno's fables, printed at Antwerp in 1567, with a dedication to Cardinal Borromeo, he instantly conceived that he had discovered the name of the artist in that of the author of the dedication. The fact is that Antoniano was not an engraver, but a professor of belles lettres at Rome, and later a secretary to Pope Pius V. He became a Cardinal. His dedication is not a little remarkable, as it appeared in a Dutch book, printed at Antwerp, in 1654. This book included a different set of cuts, engraved on copper, which had a different set of cuts. Another of Papillon's blunders is equally curious. He had seen an edition of the emblems of Sambucus with cuts, on which the same mark was found. In this book, there is a fine portrait of the author with his dog, under whom is the word BOMBO, which Papillon gravely informs us is the name of the engraver. He again refers to it on another cut of one of the emblems under a dog also. Had he read the verses belonging to this particular emblem, he would have immediately seen that it was nothing more than the dog's name, as Sambucus himself declares, while he pays a laudable tribute to the attachment of the faithful companion of his travels.

There was a book, titled "Doodt vermaskert" or "Death marked," which featured eighteen cuts of the Dance of Death. They were all, except three, impressions from the identical blocks of the beautiful and original subject. The above-mentioned artist had the effrontery to put his mark, together with the figure of a graving tool or knife, upon several of them. It is possible that he might have repaired them, as some of the smaller lines, which in former impressions seemed to have been trimmed, were now much clearer.

It might be tedious to describe all the imitations of the Dance of Death that have appeared at different times, as they are exceedingly numerous. However, it would be unpardonable not to notice an alphabet of initial letters with this subject, which, for humor and excellence of design, are even superior to the celebrated one. With regard to execution, especially when their minuteness is considered, they are absolutely wonderful. Their composition is entirely different from that of any of the others, and one of them is extremely indecent. They appear to have been done at Basil; for in the public library there is preserved a sheet, whereon are printed three alphabets, viz. the one mentioned, another of boys at play, and the third a dance of peasants, etc. The designs of some of the last are the same as those in a similar Dance by Holbein, formerly painted on a house at Basil, and of which some drawings are still preserved. It is not improbable that he also designed the Dance of Death for these initials. They have apparently been struck off as proofs or patterns for some book seller, and at the bottom of the sheet is the mark HL with the words "Hans Liitzelburger Formschneider."

On the Dance of Death. 27 Been Preserved the Name of a Most Exquisite Artist, Whom, From the Similarity of Style and Subject, There Is Every Reason to Suppose the Person Who Executed the Fine Cuts of the First Dance of Death. As He Worked After the Designs of Holbein, It Is Also Probable That the Painter Might Have Invented Some of the Seventeen Subjects Which Appeared in Continuation. of the Original Work, and That Liitzelburger Also Cut Them for the Subsequent Editions. From the Extreme Delicacy With Which the Initials With the Dance of Death Are Executed, There Is Reason to Suppose That They Were Not Cut. Upon Blocks of Wood, But of Metal, as Was Probably the Larger Work of the Same Subject; and in Support of This Conception It May Be Observed, That Blocks of This Kind Are Still Preserved in the Cabinets of the Curious.

In 1780 Chretien de Mechel, a Well-Known Artist and Printer at Basel, Published Forty-Five Engravings of a Death's Dance, as Part of the Works of Holbein, of Which He Intends to Give a Series. ‘Mr. Coxe, in His Travels, Has Given Some Account of This Work, That They Are Done After Some Small Drawings by Holbein, Sketched With a Pen, and Slightly Shaded With Indian Ink; That These Drawings Were Purchased by Mr. Fleischman, of Strafburg, at Crozat's Sale at Paris, and Are Now in the Collection of Prince Gallitzin, Minister from the Empress of Russia to the Court of Vienna, at Which Place He Had Frequent Opportunities of Seeing and Admiring Them. He Further Adds That Hollar Copied the These Drawings, an Opinion Which Will Admit of Some Doubt. Monf. De Mechel's Remark, That From the Dresses and Character of Several of the Figures, It Is Probable the Drawings Were Sketched in England, as Well as Mr. Coxe's Conjecture That They Were in the Arundelian Collection, Will Appear But a Slightly Founded to Any One Conversant in the Dresses of the French and German Nations at That Period, to Which They Bear at Least an Equal Resemblance: Again, One of the Cuts Represents a King Sitting at Table Under a Canopy, Powdered With Fleurs de Lis, Whose Figure Has a Remarkable Affinity to the Portraits of Francis I. If the These Drawings Were Copied From the Celebrated Wooden Cuts, They Must Have Been Done After the Year 1547, as Eight of Them Did Not Appear Till That Time. But It Has Entirely Escaped the Knowledge of All the Biographers of Holbein That Painted a Dance of Death in Fresco, Upon the Walls of the Palace at Whitehall, Which Was Consumed by Fire in 1697. This Curious Fact Is Afcertained From Two Sets of Nineteen Very Indifferent Etchings From the Wooden Cuts, by One Nieuhoff; They Were Never Published, but Copies of Them Presented to the Artist's Friends, with Manuscript Dedications in the Dutch Language, in Which He Speaks of the Above-______ The author, in one of the dedications, addressed to the Right Honourable William Benting, informs him that "he had met with the fearce 'Jittle work of H. Holbeyn in wood, which he had himself painted as large as life in fresco, on the walls of Whitehall." He then states that he had followed the original as nearly as possible and had presumed to lay his copy before him as "being born in the same palace." He considered the partiality that every one has for "the place of his nativity" and that "any account of what was curious and remarkable therein, and of what was then no more, as being destroyed by a fatal fire, must prove acceptable, particularly as there were hardly any more remains of the palace left than his own dwelling."

The author then states that the design of the painter resembled that of the founder of the Greek monarchy, who ordered the words "Remember, Philip, that thou art a man" to be written. He proceeds to describe in a "quaint manner" the different subjects of his work, "The Dance of Death." The dedication to the other copy is nearly in similar words, addressed to Mynheer Heymans, who appears to have had a dwelling assigned to him in the Palace at Whitehall. From the handwriting and Dutch names in this work, it is evident that the work is from the time of William II. However, no memorial of the artist is preserved; however, the importance of the fact that he has sent will render him a valuable personage in the opinion of the lovers of the arts.

It is hoped that no additional evidence will be required to show that Holbein did not invent the subjects or execute the cuts belonging to "The Dance of Death," which is usually ascribed to him. He painted it, however, and most assuredly more than once, seems to be within the realm of doubt.

It only remains to give an account of the prints which are the immediate object of this publication. It has been commonly supposed that Hollar copied the prints from the original cuts, but Mr. Coxe thinks he followed the drawings engraved by De Mechel, which he imagines to have been in the Arun-delian collection. Both opinions seem erroneous, as many of Hollar's prints are materially different from the cuts and drawings. They are very close copies of the cuts already mentioned to have been first published in 1555 with the mark of A+.

It is noteworthy that almost the same variations from the original cuts are found in He mutt's copies. He must have either had both the sets of wooden cuts or copied the paintings at Whitehall. His acknowledged fidelity would not have allowed him to depart from his originals, whatever they were. As they now remain, they are not correct copies of any single existing model.

Hollar's prints were first published in 1651 with borders designed by Abraham a thofe of the edition of 1555) in De Mechel's prints and in Hollar's etchings. This circumstance renders it probable that the last were all copied from the same originals, which might have been the work of Holbein, to whom the variations may also be attributed. In 1682, there appeared 'engraved copies of the Dance of Death, in a work entitled '* Theatrum more D 2 Sahbe ey 4% Va 36 ON THE DANCE OF DEATH, Diepenbeke, and afterwards without the borders. In this latter impression, the letters FB. i. occur upon every print, and are intended for “Holbein invenit,” as appears from some other of Hollar's prints, which have upon them the words at length. No panegyric is here wanting upon the works of this admirable artist; they are sufficiently known and esteemed by every connoisseur of taste; and particularly his Dance of Death. The first which appear to have been but little used, have been till lately preserved in a noble family, and impressions from them are “tis humane,” by J. Weichard. The first engravings are within borders of fruit, flowers, and animals, which are executed with an uncommon degree of elegance.

He also engraved the six first letters of the alphabet, adorned with small figures of a Death's Dance, and one large plate of the same subject for Dugdale's St. Paul's, and the ‘Monasticon;’ but this last plate is only a copy from an old wonder cut prefixed to Lydgate's Dance of Macaber, at the end of his fall of princes, printed by D 3 Stadtbibticthek Augsburg ae eS | Le Pe eee See PA eee Pe ve 7 or f ” 3 ; yovas if igen \ , § at git eho P * ; 19 ee aie. . ee 7 , 3 - ¥ f 38 ON THE DANCE OF DEATH. ~ ; er a ei ‘Tottell in 1554, and was set to the Denetot'Des St. ‘MORTALIVM NOBILITAS 10 _ Memorare noviliima & in eterninm non .

IT has been supposed by Papillon, without the least authority, or even probability, that the two figures represent the persons for whom Holbein painted this work. It has been already shown that Holbein did not design this plate. It is altogether emblematic, and appears to be an heraldic representation of mortality, viz. a tattered shield, surmounted with a death's head; the crest, an hour-glass between two arms of a skeleton, holding part of a skull. The two figures are probably intended for supporters, and represent the dress of the Swiss Nobility ager of the mon The “ MOR- oe “ TALIVM ony eS was. added “ a by Hollar, and is a tibi nie ‘voor. vxpris tue, 4 ena 43 THE TEMPTATION. iis.

In representing this subject, it is seldom that artists have been correct. The following text has been cleaned up, with incorrect characters removed and words separated.

He became so distinguished a proficient in polite learning that he opened a school in his monastery for teaching the sons of the nobility the arts of versification and the elegancies of composition. Although philology was his object, he was not unfamiliar with the fashionable philosophy; he was not only a poet and a rhetorician but a geometrician, an astronomer, a theologian, and a disputant.

He made considerable additions to those amplifications of our language, in which Chaucer, Gower, and Occleve led the way, and is the first of our writers whose style is clothed with that elegance which appears at this day to an English reader. His muse was of universal access, and he was not only the poet of his monastery but of the world in general. If a disguising was intended by the company of goldsmiths, a mask before his Majesty at Eltham, a may-game for the sheriffs and aldermen of London, a mumming before the Lord Mayor, a procession of pageants from the creation, for the festival of Corpus Christi, or a carol for the coronation, Lydgate was consulted and gave the poetry.

Mr. Warton, from whose elegant history of English poetry the above account of Lydgate is extracted, further informs us that he translated Macaber's Dance of Death from the French, at the request of the chapter of Saint Paul's, to be inscribed under the painting of that subject in their cloister; but it appears from the verses themselves that he undertook the translation at the instance of a French clerk. Lydgate's poem is neither a literal nor complete translation of the French version from Macaber; and this he himself confesses, "Out of the French I drew it of intent, Not word by word but following in substance."

This French translation has been erroneously given to Michel Marot, who was not born at the time when it was first printed. See De Bure Bibliog. instruét. No. g10g, and Warton's Correé. and Add. to Vol. II. of Hist. of Engl, Poetry.

Again, the number of the characters in Lydgate is much less than in the French, being only thirty-five, while the other contains seventy-six, and he has not only omitted several, but supplied their places with others; so that if the lines were inscribed under the painting at Saint Paul's, it must have differed materially from that at Saint Innocent's at Paris.

Stowe, upon whose sole authority all the information concerning this painting depends, says that on the north side of Saint Paul's church was a great cloister, environing a plot of ground, of old time called Pardon church-yard; whereof Thomas More, Dean of Saint Paul's, was either the first builder, or a great benefactor, and was buried there. About this cloister was artificially and richly painted the Dance of Machabray, a Dance of Death commonly called the Dance of Paul's; the like whereof was painted about St. Innocent's cloister at Paris; the metres or poetry of this Dance were translated out of French into English, by John Lydgate, Monk of Bury. He adds that this was done at the expense of Jenken Carpenter in the reign of Henry the Sixth, so that the poem and the painting appear to have been finished about the same time. In the year 1549, on the tenth of April, e. The whole of this cloffer, together with the = e * This Jenken Carpenter was town clerk of Loa- don, 1430, and executor of Richard Whittington.

All the antient Dances of Death, though evidently to be deduced from one original, differed very materially in the number and defign of the characters.
