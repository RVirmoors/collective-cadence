It was at the end of the forties that De Martino began active fieldwork in the South of Italy. His research over the next decade resulted in three books, of which The Land of Remorse is the last. The first, Morte e Pianto Rituale (Death and the Ritual Mourning) is a magisterial study of funeral customs in ancient Greece and Southern Italy (Lucania). De Martino (1975: 4—6) argues, in line with Croce's (1922) observations on the cult of death in his Frammenti di etica, that rituals of mourning enable the bereft, who experience the death of at least a near-one as something like a death in themselves, to overcome their entrapment in a crisis of mourning — a crisis of presence. Through the objectification and generalization — the dehistoricization — of the defunct, the mourners are able, paradoxically, to reintegrate themselves in human history (Saunders 1993: 883). For De Martino, the mourning rituals of ancient Greece provide a sort of paradigmatic background for mourning rituals practiced within the Mediterranean area in general and in particular in the backlands of the Mezzogiorno. In Sud e magia (The South and Magic), De Martino gives greater attention to the social environment in which the belief in magic prevails, arguing that poverty and consequent powerlessness and vulnerability feed a sense of pervasive evil and a belief in magic. The people living in miseria, as De Martino suggests, incorporate the evil within themselves as an alienating, destructive, and altering identity. The third and final volume of De Martino's on-the-ground ethnographic studies is "The Land of Remorse." It is more than an ethnographic study of tarantism; it is a treatise on methodology and historical-ethnological interpretation. It exemplifies the insertion of "ethnographic exploration" in "religious-historical reconstruction" (pp. 6ff.). Such reconstructions are not immune to their own historical circumstances, and may, I would argue, be considered part of the tarantism complex itself.

De Martino recognizes the importance of critical reviews of the way tarantism has been interpreted over the centuries, from a theological perspective to a contemporary medical and psychiatric one. The Land of Remorse is based on the research of an interdisciplinary team, one of the first of its kind, which consisted of a medical doctor, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, an ethnomusicologist, an anthropologist, and De Martino himself.

De Martino goes to great pains to discuss his team's particular methodology. The team spent June 1959 in the Salentine Peninsula in Apulia, where on the feast-day of Saints Peter and Paul (June 29) those afflicted by tarantism — the tarantati — gather at the Church of Saint Paul in Galantina to be cured of the effects of a "spider bite."

Despite the intensity of the field research, De Martino himself recognizes that the length of the research was insufficient. He also does not consider the effect on his research of a team of professional scholars descending on a small peasant community, who demand, however subtly, access to the intimate life of a notoriously mistrustful people.

The tarantati, mostly women, exhibit various symptoms: falling to the ground, feelings of prostration, anguish, psychomotor agitation, beclouding of the sensory apparatus, difficulty in standing, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, parathesia, muscular pains, and heightened sexual desire (p. 28). De Martino emphasizes the depressive dimension of tarantism — "sorrowful nostalgia," which is reflected in the curing music of tarantella, itself reminiscent of traditional funeral lamentations [p. 50].

The first question De Martino's team had to determine was whether or not the spider's bite was the (sole) cause of tarantism. Of the twenty-one farantati whose cases they examined, only one had in fact been bitten. Moreover, as many if not most farantati are afflicted anew each year, the team concluded that tarantism was a cultural phenomenon modeled on the symptoms of arachnidism. (De Martino suggests, on historical evidence, that real spider bites experienced by the Crusaders in their camps facilitated this symbolic elaboration.) He argues that tarantism "constituted a symbolic apparatus for evoking and configuring on a mythical-ritual level those psychic conflicts which had not found a resolution on the level of consciousness and which operated in the darkness of the unconscious, with the risk of appearing as neurotic symptoms" (p. 46). The "rebites" and their treatment serve, according to De Martino, to alleviate the unconscious conflict. Although the team did not have the time to delve as deeply as they might into the lives of the tarantati in order to determine possible conflicts that got played out in their afflictions and cures, the several case studies De Martino presents support his argument.

The most developed of these cases, that of Maria da Nardo (pp. 39-46), suggests a relationship between her first "bite" and her family's refusal to let her marry the man with whom she was in love, for she was first afflicted at this time. Pursued by another suitor, she had a vision of Saint Paul who instructed her not to marry. When the suitor carried her away — marriage by abduction was occasionally practiced in the area — she was again instructed by the Saint to leave her "husband." The Saint appeared on a Sunday at noon — on exactly the same day and time of her first bite. She was bitten again and had to "dance" for nine days before she had appeased the Saint for her disobedience — before the spider was exorcised. She then married her present husband but continued to be afflicted on a seasonal basis. As De Martino sees it, "The 'first bite' took place right after her disappointment in love, showing its symbolic character even in its attribution of a day and hour which are canonical in tarantism. On the occasion of the first bite, a pact of loyalty and mystical marriage to St. Paul constituted the sublimated figure of her first unlucky love. On the same day and at the same hour as those of the first bite the jealous Saint came to take her from the farmhouse to which she had fled [been abducted], violating their pact, and he punished the betrayal by renewing the 'bite' and 'poison,' forcing her to dance. Compelled by circumstances to marry a man whom she did not love, Maria periodically continued to pay tribute to the taranta and the Saint, each time reciting the event of the bite of love in the symbolism of the ritual, and each time being cured through the grace of her heavenly husband, the projection and sublimation of the ground she had irremedially lost. In the mythical-ritual horizon of tarantism and the Christian graft of St. Paul's figure, Maria periodically released her conflicts and converted her frustrations into symbol, lightening the periods between ceremonies — that is, daily life — of the burden of unconscious stimulations which would have been extremely dangerous had they not found a socialized and traditionalized project of calendrical, festive treatment in tarantism. (p. 45)

Although we might be unwilling to accept De Martino's functionalist psychoanalytic interpretation, we have, I believe, to recognize the role that a cultural — De Martino's mythical-ritual — idiom plays in rearticulating personal, indeed intimate, conflicts in a shared, depersonalizing discourse that, as it masks the conflicts not only for their public but also for the conflicted, facilitates their symbolic resolution through exorcistic dances of tarantism. 1. I use "exorcistic" with some hesitation, since it is not altogether clear what the status of the afflicted is. Are they poisoned by the spider's bite? Are they possessed by the spider? Are they enraptured by the saint? Are they struck by the devil? Is the illness, the affliction itself, exorcized? Is the aim of the tarantella the permanent expulsion of whatever the source of affliction is thought to be? Or is the goal the creation of an accommodating bond — a symbiotic relationship — between the tarantata and the tarantula or any other source of affliction? De Martino is never clear.
2. To insist, however, as the French ethnomusicologist Gilbert Rouget does (1985: 158-66), that the tarantata is possessed by the spider and that the tarantella is simply an exorcism of the possessing spider is, in my view, to expect an unrealistic level of systemic classification. As with the dream, the popular classification and etiology of afflictions that involve altered states of consciousness are usually messy (Crapanzano 2003).
3. Though De Martino, in line with Croce's historical particularism, insists that tarantism be regarded as an autonomous moment internal to the development of Christianity, it is, as he demonstrates convincingly, an historical amalgamation of traditional ("pagan") beliefs and practices, some dating back to ancient Greece, which are distributed throughout the Mediterranean basin, and Christian ones. The mythical-ritual idiom of tarantism is itself composite.
4. Even Rouget (1985: 162) has to admit that, given its integration into popular Catholicism, tarantism "is nothing other than a possession cult that dares not speak its name." To me, at least, it is the influence of the "dare not" — the moral and spiritual ambivalence — that has to be taken into account in local, theological, and scholarly understanding.
5. As the classicist Jeanmaire (1951) has noted, where the possessing spirit is considered to be evil, as in Christianity, exorcism aims at permanent expulsion, but where the spirit is understood in amoral terms, as in North Africa, exorcisms attempt to transform the afflicting spirit into a protective one (Crapanzano 1973). Insofar as the farantati are seasonally rebitten and have to dance the tarantella anew, it would seem that tarantism hovers between the two attitudes.
6. There are, in fact, striking parallels between tarantism and the exorcism of the North African religious brotherhoods such as the 'Isawa, the Gnawa, and the Hamadsha. Though their rituals aim at developing a symbiotic relationship with the possessing spirit, the Hamadsha of northern Morocco suffer many of the same symptoms as the tarantati. Like the tarantula, the possessing spirits have names, react to specific colors, and respond to different melodic phrases, but unlike the Hamadsha, where each possessing spirit is associated with a different dance style, the tarantella remains the same whatever the spider's identity.
7. Both dances include the mimicry of animals. The tarantati emulate the spider; the Hamadsha pigs. Of course, one does not find the same self-mutilation in tarantism that one finds among the Hamadsha and other North African brotherhoods. Though there is no single cause, like a spider bite, postulated for the affliction, the initiatory causes tend to be stereotypic. As with the ¢arantati, they usually occur between puberty and young adulthood. They do not have rich auras of associations, but the causes of later afflictions tend to evoke rich associations. Is this also true for the arantati? The inaugural event in either case authorizes a mythical-ritual (or, in my terms, symbolic-interpretive) idiom that serves at once to articulate and explain the affliction, as it displaces, indeed masks, real life explanations that we, as outsiders with one set of hermeneutical presuppositions, give greater credence to than do the tarantati (and the Hamadsha) who have a different set of presuppositions. As De Martino's cases reveal, the masking of real life circumstances empowers, unquestionably, the afflicted, who can now make all sorts of manipulative demands that have to be fulfilled.

What I found among the Hamadsha is that despite an apparent barrier separating these two discourses, many of the afflicted had an uncanny savvy of their relationship. Again, one wonders whether this is true for the farantati. It would be a mistake, however, to push the parallels between the two practices too far. As De Martino notes (p. 177), one has to treat with caution both the reduction to type and the reduction to antecedent of any cultural phenomenon being investigated.

Though both the tarantism and the religious brotherhoods of North Africa share features with possession cults around the world, they differ in accordance with cultural differences and historical particularities in important ways from any of them. This is even true where, as in the cases in point, they share, to a point, a common — "Afro-Mediterranean" — heritage.

Although De Martino draws interesting parallels with ancient Greece, including shared images of the bite (of the gadfly, oistros), the swing (adresis), the mirror, and the sword, his Crocean particularism refuses to let him look at tarantism as simply a survival from some earlier time. It is an historical formation that has to be understood in terms of the particularities of that formation.

Though clearly influenced by Marxism in a Gramscian vein, which gives to culture a certain autonomy, De Martino's understanding of the way economic formations affect tarantism is limited to either broad generalization about powerlessness, marginalization, and poverty — the remorse — of the subaltern classes of the Mezzogiorno or to the micro-economics of the tarantism itself (the economic sacrifices made by the families of the tarantati).

Although De Martino recognizes, as we have seen, the way a sense of impotence and poverty, understood in terms of pervasive evil, are internalized in terms of magic (and we could add, possession or poisoning), he does not examine in any detail the way the tarantati's "need" to dance empowers themselves not only by drawing attention to them but by forcing their families to make significant economic sacrifices.

There is in all ethnographic research and writing a moral-allegorical dimension, which reflects both the historical preoccupations of the time as well as timeless existential concerns. So in tarantism De Martino (p. xxi), more conscious perhaps than most ethnographers of the allegorical dimensions of his research, sees remorse, the rebite, "the return of the wretched past, the past which was not chosen" as in symbolic resonance with at least that part of our whole planet "which has entered the shadow-cone of its wretched past." Reflective no doubt of the period in which De Martino was writing as well as a certain depressive streak in him — his next and never completed work was on scenarios of world ending — his observations extend beyond the particular to humanity's existential condition. He writes with contradicted irony: It may perhaps seem strange that such a far-reaching discourse, which practically promises to touch heaven and earth, can emerge from such an infinitesimally regional, indeed local event [tarantism] whose levity is attested by our smile at someone who shows signs of unmotivated agitation as we jokingly ask, “Did a tarantula bite you?” But not everything we have made light of deserves such levity, and in any case “light” and “serious” do not belong to things in and of themselves, but can always be newly attributed as xiv THE LAND OF REMORSE reality unfolds according to certain “present problems” which stimulate the choice of the “important past.” Today, though tarantism continues, it has now been largely reduced to one of those folkloristic performances® by which our postmodern, our modern, sensibility has reduced so much of the past, converting the product of remorse into an entertainment business.

Preface

In the narrowest sense, The Land of Remorse is Apulia, inasmuch as this is the elective area of tarantism —a historical-religious phenomenon which developed in the Middle Ages and continued to the eighteenth century and beyond, to the present relics still usefully observable in the Salentine Peninsula. Tarantism is a "minor," predominantly peasant religious formation, although at one time it involved the upper classes, too; it is characterized by the symbolism of the taranta which bites and poisons, as well as the symbolism of music, dance and colors which deliver its victim from the poisoned bite. In a wider sense, though, the Land of Remorse—the land of a wretched past which returns and regurgitates and oppresses with its regurgitation—is Southern Italy; or more precisely the lands of what was the old Kingdom of Naples. This was a kingdom which, hemmed in between the Papal States and the sea, suggested to one of its kings the image of a land shielded from history and nearly outside of this world, “between holy water and salt water,” between the Patrimony of St. Peter and the sea. The Land of Remorse aspires to be a molecular contribution to a religious and cultural history of our South, in the prospect of a new dimension of the Southern Question. This means that the puqlecular phenomenon from which the historical discourse takes its cue—tarantism—is not considered in its local isolation (in which case it would be vain to attempt to insert it into a history). Rather, tarantism is first of all examined here in its genesis and persistence in a fully Christian epoch; second, in the way in which Catholicism, natural magic, Enlightenment reason, and positivism all reacted to it; and finally, the way in which we ourselves can react to it, within a historicism and humanism which are increasingly sensitive to everything concerning “remorse,” the return of the wretched past, the past which was not chosen.

For in a third and still broader sense, The Land of Remorse is our whole planet, or at least that part of it which has entered the shadow-cone of its wretched past. It may perhaps seem strange that such a far-reaching discourse, which practically promises to touch heaven and earth, can emerge from such an infinitesimal regional, indeed local event whose levity is attested to by our smile at someone who shows signs of unmotivated agitation, as we jokingly ask, “Did a tarantula bite you?” But not everything we have made light of deserves such levity, and in any case “light” and “serious” do not belong to things in and of themselves, but can always be newly attributed as reality unfolds according to certain “present problems” which stimulate the choice of the “important past.”

The “Southern Question,” a major concern of generations of Italian intellectuals, refers to the socio-economic gap between Southern Italy and the regions of the Center-North. Although it is rather awkward, “molecular” has been retained here and throughout the text: molecolare is a term typically used by Antonio Gramsci to mean “particular” or “individual,” and Gramsci’s language and thought profoundly influenced De Martino.

We are already partly aware of the limits of our attempt, as perhaps it was not possible to do more or better, given the conditions. For example, the period of the team’s stay in the field was too brief, even if two of its members later returned on their own to complete the investigation. The lack of a psychoanalyst prepared to work in the peasant world of the Salento hindered us from going much further with research on the meaning the symbols of tarantism assumed in the individual biographies of the tarantati. Due to the conditions in which they were administered and the lack of a control group, the personality tests could not be used to their full potential for a more precise determination of the psychology of the tarantati and for a better knowledge of the cultural environment in which tarantism takes hold. The historical research could be improved with further developments. But we take the liberty of asking the reader not only for a critique of the single parts, but also a comprehensive evaluation of the historical research method proposed here, which while maintaining the historian’s role as guide also secondarily makes use of other experiences and other disciplines in an attempt to overcome the traditional antithesis between humanism and naturalism. By its very nature, a study such as this one is indebted to many. First of all, there are those "living persons" who were forced to take on the unnatural role of "historical documents" in the Process of ethnographic investigation: an inevitable violence which the ethnographer was obliged to perform, one which has made him incur a debt with these "living persons" that is not entirely paid back with a work of religious historiography, no matter how conscientiously it is conceived and written. Along with the direct collaborators cited extensively in the text, we must also thank the Centro Nazionale di Studi di Musica Popolare of the Accademia di Santa Cecilia, whose director Giorgio Nataletti willingly agreed to the Center's collaboration in our study, making it possible to use the technical recording means of RAI-TY; Prof. Mario Gozzano, who helped us choose the neuropsychiatrist who was to be part of the team; Dr. Sergio Bettini of the Parasitology Laboratory of the Istituto Superiore di Sanita, who was generous with information and bibliographic data on latrodectism; Prof. Emilio Servadio, who suggested some bibliographic references on the symbolism of the spider in the psychoanalytic literature; Dr. Clara Gallini, assistant to the professorship in History of Religion at the University of Cagliari, who actively collaborated in the collection of material on the historical antecedents of tarantism in Greek religion; our friend Elémire Zolla, who indicated Leonardo da Vinci’s concise symbolic interpretation of the bite of the taranta; and still others who are mentioned in the notes to the text. During the ethnographic investigation, the archivist of the Curia of Otranto — through the good offices of Father Fedele Lazari— graciously searched through the reports of pastoral visits for anything concerning what happened in the chapel of St. Paul; the director of the Biblioteca Provinciale of Lecce, Dr. * De Martino uses the term "naturalism" to refer to approaches in the social sciences which tend to naturalize culture, making it an object of study in a positivist perspective. One of De Martino's earliest and most widely discussed statements on naturalism is his first book, Naturalismo e storicismo nell'etnologia (1941, Bari: Laterza [1996, Lecce: Argo]). PREFACE xii Teodoro Bernardini, helped us to identify Salentine authors who had previously written about tarantism; the doctors of the hospitals of Lecce, Galatina, Maglie, and Nardo — especially the neuropsychiatrists Prof. Verrienti and Dr. Giordano —made their work available and facilitated our task as much as they could. We owe special thanks to a local scholar, Luigi Cesari of Galatina, who generously permitted us to use the manuscript of his unpublished archival research on the history of the chapel of St. Paul. In Lecce, we paid a visit to Baron Francesco de Raho, a physician who had crossed the Salentine countryside back in 1908, studying tarantism and earning a reputation among the people as "doctor of the tarantati." A half-century ago in this furthest tip of land, this elderly gentleman sought to help the arantati with knowledge gained through the books of Charcot, Gilles de la Tourette and Pierre Janet. He welcomed us amiably in his patrician residence, so full of things from bygone days. Our visit was an homage of the new generation to the old, which — with the means it had at hand and the problems it faced — had worked honorably in the field. ERNESTO DE MARTINO Rome, February 1961 1 Introduction Once — in the era of positivist ethnography — one who set about writing an ethnographic report took special care to conceal his own passions from the public; I am referring to those passions which had led him to become an ethnographer, to embark upon that particular voyage and to choose that particular ethnographic phenomenon as his research object. The truth is that, in the ethnographers of the positivist era, the world of passions was often so miserable and tenaciously bound up with "le moi haissable" that its omission was largely justified. Indeed, in reading their memoirs and reports, there was no harm in completely forgetting the figure and the person of the "fieldworker," as these entities were negligible. However, it is also true that in memoirs and reports of this sort, despite the meticulousness with which they were elaborated and the exhaustive information they displayed, the reader ended up considering the very object of research as negligible, ciphered, and fortuitous, just as the researcher himself.

Reading the monograph of Spencer and Gillen on the Aranda, it never occurs to us to consider the problem of the cultural history of the two authors, who in 1896 (and a second time thirty years later) visited those few thousand totemist hunters then scattered throughout the center of the Australian continent, in an area nearly as large as Central and Northern Italy put together. On the other hand, having read the study, the Aranda themselves remain in the reader's mind as a fortuitous humanity, a monstrous item of gossip in mankind's history, whose ciphered strangeness does not compensate for their futility.

With the decline of positivist ethnography and the pressure of various cultural episodes that have occupied Western civilization, such as the end of the colonial period and the astonished encounter of diverse humanities on a planet that has become too small to tolerate simple coexistence, ethnographic investigation has only recently begun to see the need to justify to ourselves and to our public both terms of the relation: that is, he who travels to know and he who is visited to be known.

We have discovered that outside of this double justification, ethnographic investigation itself becomes impossible and dissolves into a world of visiting and visited shadows, insignificant and worthless despite their meticulously detailed babble. And we have recognized that for the ethnographer, objectivity does not consist in pretending from the beginning of the research to be sheltered from every passion—with the risk of falling prey to mediocre and vulgar passions and unknowingly letting them work on the ethnographic discourse, like worms teeming inside a dignified marble sepulcher.

Rather, objectivity is based on the commitment to tie one's journey to the explicit recognition of a current passion linked to a vital problem of the civilization to which one belongs, a knot in procedure or a stimulus of historia condenda or of res gerendae, and based on relating how one's "suffering" was laboriously objectified in the course of ethnographic exploration through subsequent use of the techniques of historical-cultural analysis.

The importance of C. Lévi-Strauss's Tristes Tropiques lies precisely in the fact that it is a significant document of this new course of ethnographic investigation, and in the resonance which questions and observations such as these evoke in the reader: Above all, [the ethnographer] asks himself questions. Why has he come here? With what hopes or what objectives? What exactly is the nature of anthropological research? Is it a normal occupation like any other profession, the only difference being that the office or laboratory is separated from the practitioner's home by a distance of several thousand kilometers? Or does it result from a more radical choice, which implies that the anthropologist is calling into question the system in which he was born and brought up?! And elsewhere: Western Europe may have produced anthropologists precisely because it was prey to strong feelings of remorse, which forced it to compare its image with those of different societies in the hope that they would show the same defects or would help explain how its own defects had developed within it. ... The anthropologist is the less able to ignore his own civilization and to dissociate himself from its faults in that his very existence is incomprehensible except as an attempt at redemption: he is the symbol of atonement. And again, citing “the most anthropological of the philosophes," Jean-Jacques Rousseau: The study of these savages leads to something other than the revelation of a Utopian state of nature or the discovery of the perfect society in the depths of the forest; it helps us to build a theoretical model of human society, which does not correspond to any observable reality, but with the aid of which we may succeed in distinguishing between “what is primordial and what is artificial in man’s Present nature and in obtaining a good knowledge of a state which no longer exists, which has perhaps never existed, and which will probably never exist in the future, but of which it is nevertheless essential to have a sound conception in order to pass valid judgment on our present state." In this perspective, the ethnographic journey lies within the framework of modern humanism as a total upheaval of the mythic journey into the great beyond embarked upon by magicians, shamans, initiates and mystics of all religious civilizations, who thereby seek to regain a presence lost in critical ® De Martino follows the style of his idealist-historicist mentor, Bei ing the dialectic expression historia condenda for the idea of “history in the making” and res Serendae to render “things to be done.” This couplet in turn stands in a dialectic relationship to another pair which De Martino uses below: res gestae (“things done”) and historia rerum gestarum (“history of things done,” or “history of great deeds”), capturing the double sense of history as what has happened and history as the telling of what has happened. According to De Martino’s reflexive position, the reason for turning to history in both of its meanings is to return with greater awareness to the res gerendae and historia condenda. nedetto Croce, by employ- \ INTRODUCTION 3 m oments of being in history.* The ethnographic journey does not imply } . the abandonment of a world from which we feel rejected and its recovery - through the mediation of a mythic regeneration in various forms. Instead, it is simply a coming-to-awareness of certain humanistic limits of one’s own cr zation and a stimulus to go “beyond” not what is human in general, but instead one’s own circumscribed humanity “called into question” by a certain historical circumstance. This awareness and stimulus do not imply travel in the direction of myth, but rather toward systems of cultural choices which are | simply “different” from our own — the one in which we have been “born and brought up.” And yet, during ethnographic journeys we cannot be ready to_ call into question every aspect of our modern civilization in the same manner, because this extreme felativism would itself render us — beneath the hee of an unlimited openness — much stupider and more uncomprehending than beasts, and would transform the other world of the journey into a caricature or counterfeit of the mythic journey to the kingdom of the gods. We cannot “question the fundamental result of the humanism of which we are, willingly ‘or not, the heirs: a consciousness of the human origin and destination of all cultural heritage, even — indeed, “especially” — everything which in one way or another includes the idea that culture has a metahistoric, otherworldly or divine 1 origin or destination. We cannot lower the arms of criticism in the face of the "sacred" and renounce finding the men and human motivations which have, each in their own time, generated it in the concreteness of diverse cultural situations. Consciousness of the human origins and destination of all cultural heritage is not one of several possible forms of consciousness we might have, but rather, it is our own awareness as ethnographers which follows us like a shadow; it is the most indispensable instrument of analysis we carry with us. Whatever the cultural choices we come across, it falls wholly within the sphere of our choice, which unambiguously defines our "role." We can weigh all of the proposals that man has ever advanced for living in society, on condition that we never bracket off the humanistic proposal "we are inside of." It is our task to advance incessantly, whatever the "encounters" of our journeying.

Here De Martino hints at his concept of "the crisis of presence." Influenced by the work of Hegel and Heidegger, among others, De Martino developed this concept throughout his entire opus to refer to an existential breakdown affecting the individual's sense of self in the world. While a note cannot offer full treatment of this complex notion, there are useful indications in De Martino (1995) Storia e metastoria. I fondamenti di una teoria del sacro, Marcello Massenzio, ed. (Lecce: Argo); Placido and Maria Cerchi (1987), Ernesto De Martino. Dalla crisi della presenza alla comunita umana (Naples: Liguori); in English, George Saunder's article "The Crisis of Presence in Italian Pentecostal Conversion," American Ethnologist (1995, 22: 324-340).

Like much of the Introduction, this paragraph offers us a sense of De Martino's "critical ethnocentrism," his original formulation which, in short, rejected excessive cultural relativism and at the same time stressed a critical awareness of how the observer's own perspective and Categories are culturally conditioned. For further discussion in English, see George Saunders' article, "‘Critical Ethnocentrism' and the Ethnology of Ernesto De Martino, American Anthropologist (1993, 95: 875-893), and Annalisa Di Nola, "How Critical Was De Martino's "Critical Ethnocentrism' in Southern Italy?" In Italy's "Southern Question": Orientalism in One Country. ed. Jane Schneider. Oxford: Berg: 157-175.

Considerations of this sort are valid not only for the ethnography of so-called primitive civilizations, but also for metropolitan ethnography, at least insofar as the latter addresses the study of archaic phenomena still present in the cultural life of modern nations. The fact that in this case the journeys to be undertaken are shorter and less arduous does not make them substantially different, since it is still a matter of an encounter with obsolete human behavior which contrasts with the system "in which we were born and brought up," recalling ideologies which are no longer current and for which we no longer possess a key. The differences, if any, are elsewhere; in any case, like the ethnographer working in primitive civilizations, the ethnographer who operates on metropolitan territory cannot escape the necessity of justifying his vocation for "eccentric" cultural phenomenon. Otherwise, he runs the risk of appearing a "junk" collector, just as eccentric in his own behavior as the people he is studying, and just as irrelevant in his assiduous, erudite toil as the highly ciphered and banal lists of "usages and customs" he compiles. In the 1500s, the Jesuit missionary experience in the Viceroyalty of Naples led to the emergence of the "Italian India" concept. This term was used to describe the Abruzzi, Apulia, Naples, and Sicily regions. In a letter dated November 23, 1571, Girolamo Nadal wrote to Pietro Branca, rector of the Jesuit college of Teramo, expressing his belief that Branca would be delighted by their next trip to the Abruzzi. Branca responded, believing it would be beneficial to establish a college in the area for the "Italian India."

In a letter from Cosenza, Giovanni Xavier bemoaned the condition of the people, describing them as accustomed to evil, licentious, arrogant, and without justice and government. He compared them to living in the backwoods. In another letter, Michele Navarro described the harsh mountains of far Calabria and the northern and eastern coasts of Sicily, stating that the desolation of souls and the frightful ignorance in these mountains was both spiritual and temporal. He expressed his belief that traveling to these Indies could be just as profitable as going to the New World.

The Jesuitic cultural consciousness of Southern Italy as "India-de por aca" was not a chance metaphor. Instead, it signaled a real analogy between the new world to be won over to Christian civilization and the cultural conditions of vast zones of the Neapolitan viceroyalty. The same relationship between Southern Italy and the New World was manifested in a more immediate way on another level of the cultural consciousness of the period. In the dreamy vision which Tommaso Campanella opposes to the chaotic reality of his Southern homeland, the New World appears — after the failure of the Calabrian revolution — as the promised land where the mustard seed of the message contained in the City of the Sun will bear fruit. In the imagination of this friar of peasant origins, the course of world history, determined by the stars, has indeed given life to new heresies, but at the same time it has also produced the founders of the Jesuits and the Capuchins, and Columbus and Cortez have exposed the new hemisphere to divine religion.5 So that the seed that in Calabria fell on rock seemed to find more propitious soil in the uncontaminated Indias de por alla. And while it is doubtful that the writers of the Jesuitical state constitution of Paraguay, Fathers Cataldino and Meceta, had word of the political ideals of Campanella, the affinities between the latter’s model and the Jesuitical experiment in the New World demonstrate at least their development from a common root.

The modern ethnographer’s perspective is obviously not that of the Jesuit Missionary in the period of the Counter-Reformation; nevertheless, if the Jesuits in Southern Italy faced long and exhausting journeys — "caminar y padascer," says Navarro — they traveled in a definite perspective. And so, too, the modern ethnographer who, though with a different spirit, travels the Southern itineraries previously trodden by the Jesuits, cannot and must not shirk the questions which Lévi-Strauss asked of himself during his trying stay in Campos-Novos: "Qu’est-on venu faire ici? Dans quel espoir? A quelle fin?

Ten years ago, during a visit to the "Rabata" of Tricarico, I also asked myself these morally demanding questions, and I discovered that my budding passion as a wandering ethnographer in Southern Italy implied — to repeat once again the words of Lévi-Strauss — "calling into question the system in which we were born and brought up," like a symbol of "atonement" and "redemption." Subsequently, my task became clearer to me in a much more precise sense: the use of ethnography for the purposes of a religious history of the South, to be understood as a new dimension of the so-called "Southern question." Through participation in the movement for the rebirth and emancipation of the South in the years following the end of the Second World War — that is, through a varied, impassioned world oriented toward res gerendae and historia condenda — I developed a vocation for a certain theoretical clarification of the situation to be transformed, a vocation for res gestae and for historia rerum gestarum in the sphere of the religious life of the South.

In truth, the situation in this field of study is anything but satisfying. The illustrious tradition of Pitréi — as formed and developed from 1871 to 1913 in the monumental Biblioteca delle tradizioni popolari, from 1882 on with Archivio, and from 1885 on with the collection Curiosita popolari tradizionali — had zealously addressed the religious ethnography of Sicily and the various Southern regions. But in Pitré, as in his immediate disciples and collaborators, romantic Risorgimentali and positivistic themes co-existed in a contrast which was never settled by a coherent methodological resolution; Pitré maintained that "there were 'two' histories, that of the dominators and that of the dominated, and that the latter must not be confused with the former; thus the time had come to save the memories of the dominated — that is, the 'people' — which did not coincide with the memories of the dominators. In actual fact, the memories of the dominated in the sphere of religious life were nothing more ~ and Pitré acknowledges it incessantly ~ than 'echoes of ancient civilizations,' 'archaeological monuments of thought,' 'relics of the past' and 'geological strata revealing various épochs,' This is tantamount to saying that as current facts, they were non-history, both a negative of modern civilization and a marker of a limit to its power to expand and effectively mold custom, or even, the continuous irony which contrasted the efforts made by modern civilization to Create its own history. So what the possible 'historic sense' of the religious-folkloric material might actually be remained obscure, and this obscurity depended on the initial assumption of 'two' histories, with its romantic implications and with the exaltation of the 'people' as a mirror of truth, virtue and poetry. The religious-folkloric material which ethnographic analysis isolates from the living system of modern nations cannot become a document of history in its present state and isolation as an incoherent fragment. Rather, it ~ by serving as a stimulus to help reconstruct the period of religious civilization in which it was not an incoherent fragment, but as a living and viable moment, as an organ in an organism functioning in its social and cultural reality. Or, it can become a document of the history of the religious civilization in which it presently remains a fragment, and signals, as we have said, an episode of interruption in this civilization's evolution ~ that is, a limit to its will to history and its tolerance, compromise, syncretisms and abdications in certain areas of society, certain periods and certain areas. In both cases, the religious-folkloric material identified by ethnographic investigation becomes a document of a single history: that of the religious civilization of which it is a relic, or of the religious civilization in which it survives or is more or less profoundly remolded, but never of a 'popular' religious history set against, parallel to and competing with that of the social and cultural elites. Thus, for example, folkloric funeral lament is a component which ~ with the proper precautions ~ facilitates the reconstruction of the funeral lament in the ancient religious civilizations of the Mediterranean world and the ideology of death of which it was an integral part. 

Or else it is a series of instructive "incidents" to which Christian civilization was exposed when it sought to mold custom according to its own funerary ideology, incompatible with ancient ritual weeping, "incidents" which reached such a point in popular Passions that the Mother of God — the Christian symbol of grief - assumed some of the forms of ancient lamenting women. As for the third possibility — that of funeral lament as a document of "popular poetry continuously remolded according to time, place, situations, and individuals — the legitimacy of such a perspective certainly cannot be denied, though its importance has been exaggerated by the romantic exaltation of popular poetry. But even in this case, a literary-critical evaluation cannot be made without reference to the mythical-ritual atmosphere, to which it owes all of its possible cultural meanings.

Sete was not aware of this problem, or else he was aware of it only in a confused manner, caught up as he was in the ideology of the "two" histories and of the relative autonomy of a history of the popular world. Even when he seems to opt for a reintegration of folkloric relics into the religious civilizations in which they were once an organic part, the orientation of the research is too often tainted by that ideology as well as by a comparativism without Perspective, hunting for "analogies" in European folklore, the Classical world or the primitive world without the regulation of a well-defined problem.

Nonetheless, the ideology of the "two" histories contained a mother of truth which must be underlined in order to render full justice to Pitre and his work. In general, if we consider the history of religious life as a series of "high points" — and limit ourselves to a delineation of the passage of the transmissions and reshaping of myth-ritual nexuses in their circulation from one brilliant consciousness to another or among a very restricted, socially and culturally homogeneous elite — the religious-folkloric material is destined to 'Funeral lament, with a detailed treatment of all of these perspectives, is the saat' De Martino's Morte e pianto rituale nel mondo antico. Dal lamento funebre antico al pianto di Maria (1958, Turin: Einaudi). It is one volume of De Martino's trilogy of Southern Italian archaeologies, the other two being La Terra del Rimorso and Sud and Magia (1959, Milan: Feltrinelli). RA 8 THE LAND OF REMORSE remain outside any historiographic interest. In this historiographic perspective, the religious-folkloric material is irrelevant scrap, frivolous anecdote, irreverent gossip in the solemn course of events. But when we wish to obtain a more concrete image of a religious civilization in expansion, to measure what we might call its sociological dimension, its real power to mold custom in a variety of areas, periods, and social classes, then the religious-folkloric material becomes an important historical document as an index of the places, times, and modes of religious heritage's cultural circulation: A religious civilization in expansion always involves a pretense of cultural unification, of social cohesion, of connecting high and low within its hierarchies; its symbols reveal a marked, plastic tendency to adapt to a variety of existential situations possible in a given social order. Now, in order to measure the extent to which this pretense has been successful and to evaluate the incidents and setbacks facing a given process of religious expansion, religious-folkloric material is indispensable; it signals the power of the negative, that exploding of contradictions, that play of tensions which — for the very extreme risk they imply — make the positive power of a given religious-cultural molding appear all the more "historical." "Thus, we are not dealing with two competing histories of the same religious civilization, but a single history, rendered even more concrete by the continuous evaluation of its sociological dimension, with all of the corresponding specifications of time, place, and social means. In any case, Pitré's tradition has no appreciable relation to the Southern question: the passionate world in which it came into being and developed remains substantially romantic-Risorgimental. On the other hand, the literature relative to the Southern question was generally limited to the social, economic, and political aspects of the problem, not perceiving how the religious-historical dimension could usher in a fuller historical-cultural evaluation of Southern reality.

For example, in a series of articles by Salvemini, which appeared in Educazione Politica in 1898 and 1899, the centralizing state, the economic oppression exercised by the North upon the South, and the semi-feudal structure of the society were indicated as the three 'diseases' from which the South suffered; no hint was made, however, of the forms assumed by popular Catholicism and pagan survivals as documents of a religious history to be reconstructed. In general, in the domain of Southernist literature, religious-folkloric material has virtually no weight; the material which Pitré idolized as 'relics' to 'salvage' is for the Southernist writers reduced to simple and obvious proof of the moral and intellectual backwardness of the Southerners. At most, while investigating the economic conditions of certain populations, the folklore and religious life of the region are mentioned in order to complete the picture.

One has to wait for Gramsci to rediscover ideas and suggestions, if not for an actual religious history of the South as a new dimension of the Southern question, at least for an evaluation of Catholicism which takes into account its sociological dimension and thus includes, with reference to Italian society, popular Catholicism and folklore in its documentation.

Carlo Levi's 'rist Stopped at Eboli, inspired by the experiences in exile of another anti-St, is meant to be the work of a man of letters, which it is; we are indebted to it for something more than simple literary suggestion. In the period following the Second World War, under the pressure of the peasant—and the new relationship of some intellectuals with the Southern question, the need for a religious history of the South began to be felt as important for a better understanding of that reality. A meeting of a group of scholars in Bari in 1950, Gabriele Pepe explicitly posed the Southern question as a 'religious problem'; he later returned to the point in Pane e irre nel Sud, proposing a religious-historical perspective for the analysis of the 'decadence' and 'social inferiority' of the South."

The project could not be carried out without turning to religious-folkloric material and the ethnographic technique of investigation, given that the alluvial deposits left in this land by the millennial flow of civilizations now acquired particular value as evidence; next to the sole clean suit for holidays, even the threadbare, patched clothes of days of toil contribute to the narration of a certain history. We are not speaking, then, of a "religious history of Italy, from the pre-Roman and Roman period to the Middle Ages, to the Renaissance and beyond, indeed reaching the contemporary world, as was authoritatively, but not opportunely, proposed of late." A history of this type would lack unity, since it would be founded on an accidental geographic designation that does not display any unitary criteria within the historical narrative, unless they are counterfeit criteria that are in no way specifically individuating (as were historical problems qualified by religious civilizations and eras or by the connections between civilizations and different religious eras, in a concrete connection with cultural life in its entirety and with the various economic, social and political conditionings; geographic delimitations are acceptable to the extent that they are symbolic of a certain unitary cultural drama, of an environment or atmosphere which historical judgment may perceive.

Now, the religious history of Italy — in a concrete sense — is essentially regional, because the life of the peninsula up to the Risorgimento and Unity was regional, and only after the establishment of the unitary State may we speak of a "religious history of Italy." In particular, the religious history of the Kingdom of Naples takes on special importance among the more circumscribed regional histories. Beyond the Giannonian moonings, historical work was influenced by Cartesianism and an antipapal polemic which finally led to his excommunication. In the case with the attempt which followed from the proposal just cited, the religious-folkloric limits of a "civil history" exemplify the sociological dimension of the cultural traditions of the South, the ways in which Christian civilization expanded in this land, the limits of this expansive force, the establishment and functioning of a whole series of intermediate connections between the peaks of high culture on the one hand and pagan remains and low ceremonial magic on the other, and finally, the varied cultural conditioning which favored the incessant disassembly and reassembly of such heterogeneous elements in the search for more or less stable balances.

For a history of this sort, the approach of a certain Protestant literature is definitely not helpful (for example, Trede's monumental work), one in which the religious life of the South is basically an all-too-evident pretext for conducting an anti-Catholic polemic. This literature is to be judged more as an immediate testimony to this polemic than as a contribution to religious historiography. As for travel books, there are some — for example, that of C.A. Meyer and Alexandre Dumas' famous Corricolo — which undoubtedly contain some fresh impressions of popular Catholicism and low ceremonial magic, but at most they are documents to be used with the necessary caution, "impressionistic" judgments. To reassemble the disintegrated, chaotic, and contradictory panorama of Southern religious life, the observer must follow the "molecular" path of ethnographic data analysis, aided by other investigation techniques, to determine what was once authentically pagan and analyze the events that followed in the Christian period. This allows us to understand the successes and failures of these attempts and the reasons behind them. Only in this way can disintegration and chaos become components of a definite historic coherence, marking the internal limits that characterized the course of hegemonic cultural forms in these lands. This represents a conquest for historia rerum gestarum and res gerendae.

The idea of conducting an ethnographic investigation of Apulian tarantism, and thus beginning the projected series of contributions toward a religious history of the South, came to me while looking at some of André Martin's excellent photographs of the scenes that take place in the Chapel of St. Paul in Galatina every year from June 28 to 30. The photos showed a young woman jumping on a corbel of the altar, then resting on the Eucharistic table, and an old man on the floor, supine and yelling with raised arms. Next to him, two other young women dressed in white were also supine and disheveled. The expression "low ceremonial magic" refers to traditional magical ideologies and practices related to the "evil eye," charms, spells, amulets, potions, and various rituals used for love, illness, child rearing, the weather, and many other aspects of what De Martino calls in his corpus "the peasant regime of existence."

De Martino contrasts low ceremonial magic, on the one hand, to magical forms in Catholic ritual (such as the Eucharist or exorcism), and on the other hand to the "natural magic" of the Renaissance, which developed from alchemy, astrology, and related traditions. The photographs could be seen as images of strange, eccentric behavior, arousing momentary curiosity. But for me, they were a stimulus for anchoring the planned religious history of the South to a circumscribed episode to be analyzed, to a phenomenon that recalled the commitment to historiographic coherence in an exemplary manner, precisely because it appeared as a knot of extreme contradictions.

The young woman jumping on the corbel of the altar, the supine old man yelling with raised arms, the other young woman, and the mystic bride did not have much in common with the Apostle to the Gentiles who had so authoritatively anathematized the disorders in the Church of Corinth. And yet, there they were in the name of St. Paul — indeed, in his chapel — protagonists of an extreme disorder, nearly twenty centuries after the famous words had resonated: "If I speak with human tongues and angelic ones as well, but do not have love, I am a noisy gong, a clanging cymbal." "These simple reflections alone hinted at a troubled history behind the very eccentric personalities of the photographs, a history which signaled certain halts in the process of Christian civilization’s expansion in some given where, when and how. But that was not all. The protagonists in the chapel caught by the photographic lens were “tarantati”® who had come from several villages in the Salento, where many of them had celebrated a singular rite in their respective homes: through the vibrant symbolism of music, dance and colors, they had undergone the exorcism of the taranta, whose bite had plunged the victim into # moral languor or a desperate, horizonless agitation. The¥pot of contradictions thus became still more intricate, since the bite of the taranta could be interpreted on the one hand in a realistic sense as the bite of a poisonous arachnid — for example, Latrodectus tredecimguttas; on the other hand, the behaviors typical of tarantism seemed to be drawn from definite cultural choices, from mythical-ritual symbols. A famous example came to mind, that of the sting of the oistros [gadfly] which implacably persecuted Io, according to the representation by Aeschylus in Prometheus; musical exorcism Was associated with musical catharsis practiced all over Greece and theorized by Pythagoreanism, which in these very lands had its day; the tarantate recalled maenads, Bacchantes, Corybantes, and everyone else who took part in a religious life rife with orgiastic cults and “mania” in the ancient world. The scene in the chapel of Galatina therefore appeared as a fragment of the very world against which Paul of Tarsus had so bitterly fought; the only evidence of a Christian The translation retains the Italian term taratati to refer to those afflicted by tarantism, while maintaining faithful to De Martino’s various use of the word’s forms: tarantato, masculine singular; tarantata, feminine singular; tarantate, feminine plural; tarantati for both the masculine plural and mixed-sex plural. De Martino seems to alternate the use of the gendered forms casually, and while Italian does use the masculine as a default or for mixed-gender groups, this nonetheless poses some problems since De Martino stresses throughout the text that tarantism mainly strikes women. 2 THE LAND OF REMORSE influence in this scene was the fervent invocation of the apostle as “my St. Paul of the tarantate.” There were, then, good reasons for choosing tarantism as the topic of a first concrete contribution to a planned religious history of the South, as conceived in the perspective described above. In the 1600s, the Jesuits who crossed the Indias de por acd had already come up against tarantism. Through Fathers Nicolello and Galliberto, respectively the rectors of the colleges of Taranto and Lecce, they provided their famous brother, Father Atanasio Kircher, with material for his interpretation of the phenomenon, essentially developed within the framework of Baroque iatromusic.? Again in the 1600s, through the work of Epifanio Ferdinando and Giorgio Baglivi, a more specifically medical literature developed on the same topic, oriented toward the evaluation of tarantism as disease. But today, in a new era with new perspectives, the necessity of a religious-historical study was felt, one which considered tarantism as an episode in the conflict between Christianity and paganism in Southern cultural life and society. The ethnographic exploration for the study of Salentine tarantism was prepared at our center in the winter of 1959, as the fieldwork was planned for the month of June, a period which includes the days of the displays in the chapel." The fundamental problem to resolve in the preparatory phase was that of method. In this phase, all the motivations which had led to the choice of the topic and the perspective in which to consider it became simply "working hypotheses" to verify, hermeneutic criteria to subject to the test of documentation, especially ethnographic documentation. The vast literature on tarantism, from the seventeenth century to date, featured a series of different points of view, each requiring a careful evaluation of its validity, since only in this way could a thesis be made of the hypothesis that a religious-historical perspective was the most pertinent in relation to the given phenomenon.

In the literature on tarantism from the seventeenth century on, the medical interpretation was most prominent: according to this interpretation, tarantism was a disease to be attributed either to a toxic syndrome from a poisonous arachnid bite, or to a psychic disorder which might or might not be dependent on arachnidism. This predominant interpretation was related to the cultural orientation of the authors who, from the 1600s on, studied the topic; indeed, Epifanio Ferdinando, Girolamo Marciano, Baglivi, Caputo, De Renzi, Carusi and the like were doctors, and very recently Katner (1956) and Giordano (1957) are also doctors. Only in a secondary way did another perspective emerge, which we may call cultural, from the Jesuit Kircher to Sigerist (1945) and Schneider (1948), not to mention a few scattered hints in the so-called "folkloristic" literature.

But apart from Schneider's work, which in any case is to be read with extreme caution, even in the writings of the non-physicians the more or less mediated influence of the medical view was felt, undoubtedly assumed as a result and not as a thesis to be verified within the historical-cultural perspective itself. It was evident, then, that our investigation in the field would have to reckon with the medical point of view on the subject, since if tarantism were actually nothing more than a disease, there would be little margin left for a religious-historical interpretation; at most one could have spoken of a secondary cultural conditioning of the morbid state, of an accidental complication of it through the influence of traditional ideologies. In any case, tarantism would have remained preeminently within the doctor's competence, not that of the historian of religious life.

So, to decide how things stood on this point and to examine the validity of a predominantly cultural-historical and religious-historical interpretation of tarantism, the collaboration of a doctor took on special significance. After a few exploratory interviews, the choice of a field collaborator fell upon Dr. Giovanni Jervis, who was doing his specialization at the neuropsychiatric clinic of the University of Rome. To aid the psychiatrist, and in particular to administer projective tests to the tarantati, Dr. Letizia Jervis-Comba was called in; from 1954 to 1956, she had completed an M.A. thesis on the "iatromusic" aspects of the phenomenon. A. in psychology at Cornell University (Ithaca, NY), presenting a thesis with original research. Finally, in view of the relationship between tarantism — which was hypothetically assumed to be an essentially religious-historical phenomenon — and the toxic syndrome of the bite of Latrodectus tredecimguttas, a constant rapport of consultation was maintained with Dr. Sergio Bettini of the Istituto Superiore di Sanita, who was generous with bibliographic data and information on latrodectism.

f. The literature on tarantism had made frequent reference to its musical aspect. From the seventeenth century on, a whole series of authors beginning with Kircher had considered the phenomenon above all as an example of iatromusic. As late as 1948, the ethnomusicologist Marius Schneider, director of the Institute of Musical Ethnography of Berlin, published a “musicological, ethnographic and archaeological” essay on medicinal rites, in which tarantism and the tarantella as a sword dance had an important place. The ethnomusicological point of view, then, also had to be examined for its validity; to this end, an invitation to collaborate in the research was extended to Dr. Diego Carpitella, instructor at the Conservatorio di Musica di Santa Cecilia and at the Accademia Nazionale di Danza in Rome, assistant and researcher at the Centro Nazionale di Studi di Musica Popolare of the Accademia di Santa Cecilia and at RAL TV, joint producer with Alan Lomax of an anthology of Italian folk music for the Colombia World of Folk and Primitive Music series, and who since 1952 had been my assiduous musical collaborator in the ethnographic explorations conducted in the South, especially for the collection of musical material relative to funeral lament.

’y Finally, the relationship between tarantism and the economic and social order had to be considered. From the earliest works, no author has failed to mention the fact that tarantism is a predominantly peasant phenomenon (although in the past it also involved other social classes to some degree), and that Southern Italy and in particular Apulia seemed to be its chosen land of origin and diffusion, or at least of its most precise cultural individuation. This implied the problem of the relationship between tarantism and the limits of development which, for precise historical reasons, have characterized the economic and social life of our South. Moreover, tarantism affected the sphere of economic interests and the life of the society in a direct and specific manner, inasmuch as the entry “expenses for musicians” constituted a notable debit in the family budget of the tarantati, while the entry “profits from musical services” figured significantly in the credits of the musicians’ budgets. Finally, tarantism — at least since the time it was inserted into the cult of St. Paul by virtue of the Catholic attempt to control it and bring it within the orbit of the Church — has involved the collecting of alms and donations “on behalf of the Saint”; this has contributed profits to the administrative budget of the chapel of St. Paul. These relationships demanded a series of verifications and analyses which could be conducted in part through the field investigation and in part by using documents relative to the past. To collaborate in this sector we called in Dr. Amalia Signorelli-D’Ayala, who had earned her degree in 1957 with a thesis in cultural anthropology, and who had worked as a collaborator for a year at the Centro Studi per la Geografia Antropica under the direction of Prof. Almagia, as a staff researcher at the Istituto di Etnologia of the University of Perugia, and as instructor of cultural anthropology in the Social Work schools, did not seem appropriate to provide for an autonomous Appendix on this subject, as we did with the psychiatric, psychological and ethnomusicological appendices. On the one hand, a monographic treatment of the social and economic conditioning of tarantism risked ending up as a series of data and analyses which had a too indirect or too obvious relation to tarantism; on the other hand, if the data and analyses were pertinent, they would carry out their task of clarification better by being organically incorporated at the right point into the religious-historical discourse itself. Our collaborator therefore had the task of furnishing the sociological-religious and economic elements which would render this discourse more concrete.

In this way, inspired by criteria inherent in the character of the study, the structural formula of the team about to begin fieldwork was developed: a historian of religions as director of the team and a group of four young collaborators trained, respectively, in psychiatry, psychology, ethnomusicology and cultural anthropology. Such a formula indeed seemed the most appropriate for the essentially religious-historical perspective of the investigation and for the 4

The team also included the Photographer Franco Pinna and Annabella Rossi, a young anthropology graduate. Pinna's photos of tarantism, along with others from the fieldwork, are featured in J Viaggi nel Sud di Ernesto De Martino (2002, Turin: Bollati Boringhieri); essays by the editors Clara Gallini and Francesco Faeta discuss De Martino's use of visual and sound recording in his ethnographic work. Annabella Rossi later returned to the Salento to conduct further research, from which she published a book of her correspondence with a tarantata, Lettere da una tarantata (1970, Bari: De Donato). She also produced a corpus of photographs of tarantati and life in the Salento, presently conserved in the Museo Nazionale delle Artie Tradizioni Popolari (Rome).

INTRODUCTION 15

During the preparatory period, another problem of method was also discussed; one of particular importance in defining the character of the investigation and the structure and functioning of the team. An ethnographic exploration of tarantism in the framework of a religious-historical reconstruction obviously cannot directly face the problem of the most suitable means for hastening the disappearance of a "relic which is so disorganic in relation to the modern world. However much the choice of the phenomenon to be explored and the religious-historical perspective in which to explore it had their roots, as stated above, in a knot of historic conditions, and however much the historical knowledge of a reality to be transformed serves to increase the operative power of the transforming action, it was not possible to unify and mix the two moments in the same study, seeking to preserve the phenomenon for study and simultaneously rejecting it for its cultural "backwardness. If it is true that scientific objectivity is gained through an original transforming motivation, and if it is true that the efficacy of the will to transform is fed by the progress of scientific objectivity, it is also true that they are two rigorously distinct moments, and that science is more operatively efficacious the more it conquers and maintains its own autonomy in the general movement of cultural life. In our ethnographic exploration, we thus strove to choose the moment of knowledge about the phenomenon and to remain faithful to this choice; this excluded any systematic analysis of ways of intervening to modify the ethnographically observable situation. Moreover, the problem of “transformation” which nourished the religious-historical research far transcended the chosen, molecular episode, and it would have impoverished both the study and its motivations to attempt a reduction of the operative knot to be untied to a study of the best way to hasten the disappearance of a cultural phenomenon already condemned to disappear completely in the space of a few decades.

Our investigation took its cue from tarantism to offer a first Contribution toward a religious history of the South, conceived—as stated above—in such a way as to renew the traditional Southernist consciousness itself. It is here that the most pertinent operative contribution of the investigation may be found—not in questions relative to any local intervention, given that Salentine Society in motion has already actually intervened day by day in ways which are more or less indirect, but not for this less corrosive or destructive. Nonetheless, it seemed appropriate to welcome a social worker into the team, who in a discrete manner and within the limits consented by the historical-religious character of the study, would remind us that the tarantati and all those involved in tarantism were not only “documents” for a historical reconstruction, but (living persons within a particular society, citizens of the Italian State. If in the religious-historical perspective they were to be evaluated as documents, this was only through an abstraction which was as necessary as it was provisional; this abstraction was all the more legitimate in its methodological rigor in that some indirect indications which emerged from it suggested that another, differently oriented and structured team could confront the situation in the perspective of possible modification and intervention.

So it was established that the social worker, in the person of Vittoria De Palma, would have as her principle task that of facilitating relations between the team and the tarantati for the purposes of a study oriented in a religious-historical sense, but without losing sight—secondarily and with extreme discretion—of the gradual configuring of the other perspective as the fieldwork and interpretation of the data proceeded (see Appendix 5). We spent the spring of 1959 at our center conducting a seminar in preparation for the fieldwork. This involved establishing a first contact with the literature on the subject, agreeing upon a common scientific language in relation to the various aspects of the phenomenon, planning the field investigation to the greatest extent possible, dividing up the tasks in a clear way, compiling the questionnaires, and above all, individuating working hypotheses that were acceptable to all in a fundamental unity of method and perspective. Bearing in mind the diverse professional specializations of the team members and the distance dividing scholars of humanistic disciplines and scholars of naturalistic disciplines (a particularly appreciable distance in Italy, for well-known historical reasons), it becomes clear how this effort toward methodological unification took on particular importance for the results of the fieldwork. Indeed, every interdisciplinary collaboration between humanists and naturalists is destined to failure if the complementary use of respective skills is not explicitly preceded by the choice of a dominant perspective, and if a minimum of conscious agreement on this point has not been reached by all of the members of the team. Undoubtedly, such agreement matured above all in the course of the fieldwork, when the agreed instruments of analysis began to function and were tested with the response of reality. But the seed was already sown back at our center in a series of meetings which constituted a singular experience for all, rich with precious teachings.

The concrete religious-historical problem to be confronted put into focus the difficulties deriving from the long disuse of dialogue between humanists and naturalists, difficulties which—as already stated—were rendered particularly acute by the recent cultural history of our country, where positivism was more narrow-minded than elsewhere, and where idealism contributed so energetically to relegating medicine, psychology, and sociology to the enclosed garden of pseudoconcepts.

From the diverse participants in those meetings, there was a re-emergence of the various corporative closures and opposed dogmatisms resulting from dialogues which were long suspended or had never begun. Nonetheless, under the pressure of the unifying, chosen problem in the human and historical-cultural reality of our South, a new commitment developed in all of us, a need for faithfulness and loyalty which ended up questioning the various corporative closures and opposed dogmatisms.

On the wall of the room where the meetings were held, there was a large portrait of Benedetto Croce with a signed dedication to the author, and the philosopher INTRODUCTION W watched us with his amiably sly and mischievous air during the discussions in which, despite all appearances, we were still speaking about him. And indeed, weren't our difficulties and efforts largely conditioned by the influence which his work had exercised, positively as well as negatively, on Italian cultural life?

During the preparatory period at our center, we had to solve another delicate question of courtesy toward a foreign scholar of tarantism, Prof. Wilhelm Katner of Leipzig, Assistant Director of the Karl Sudhoff-Institut für Geschichte der Medizin und Naturwissenschaften. Prof. Katner, who in 1952 had written marginally about the musical therapy of tarantism in a monograph dedicated to the relationship between music and medicine in the Baroque age, published a specific article on the subject in 1956 in the Atti dell'Accademia Leopoldina. The author had written to colleagues at the University of Bari to find out if ethnographically observable relics of the phenomenon still existed in Apulia; unfortunately, our colleagues in Bari did not provide him with the necessary information as they should have, and for this reason his work was conducted exclusively on philological bases, as if the disappearance of the phenomenon had by then eliminated any possibility of direct observation.

To partially amend the oversight of our colleagues from Bari, it seemed appropriate to inform the German scholar of our ethnographic exploration, at the same time inviting him to join us to verify his interpretive hypotheses, even after some delay. Prof. Katner gladly accepted the invitation, promising to join us in Galatina, which in fact he did. In the meantime, the preparatory phase having reached its conclusion, the team left Rome for Galatina one June morning in 1959. C.

8. A cornerstone of the methodological consciousness of modern historiography is the notion that historiographic research can gain its objectivity only if it is stimulated by problems of transformation of the present reality in which the historian and his period are involved. This is not simply a matter of the thesis of the contemporaneousness of any new history, according to the formulations which Croce has made familiar in Italian cultural life. What is important is the fact that, through a meaningful convergence, cultural experiences which have matured in very different environments from that of Croce’s historicism have reached analogous formulations not only externally (which would mean little), but as voices and moments of a humanistic unity in the process of formation. Dewey’s work, from Experience and Nature to Logic, continuously reaffirms the thinking of a historiography born from the commitment to transforming the existing world and which assists such a transformation; the past remains mute until it is “chosen” in relation to a problem of the present. In Bloch’s Apologie pour I’histoire, historical research is understood as the reciprocal relationship between 18
10. 11. THE LAND OF REMORSE past and present: the present is understood to the extent that it refers to the past which generated it, and the past is understood to the extent that the effort toward comprehension also includes the analysis of the present situation from which the historical investigation took its stimulus. In Febvre’s Combat Pour l'histoire (1953), the current problems which involve the historian and the period in which he lives on the one hand serve as a guide to the selection of documents available, and on the other preside over the formation of hypotheses to test. We find analogous evidence in Marrou’s De la conaissance historique (1954), Finally, the process of objectivization — carried out through the “faithfulness” of the testing of the formulated hypotheses in order to construct the past within the present in which we are engaged — assumes the form of a moment of the same faithfulness to rationally modify the present, going beyond the immediacy of those “factional passions” which represent the corporative interests of the faction itself.

The first problem the team had to resolve in the field was that of the criteria for sampling some tarantati in order to give the research a base. This problem had already been examined in our center during the preparatory seminar, but now, in the field, the criteria advanced from afar had to be adapted to the real situation in which we were operating. In consideration of the historical-cultural and religious-historical character of the hypothesis we wanted to test, we settled upon considering “tarantati” all those who, in the summer of 1959, had been involved in an event which characterized them as “tarantati” with the local people, and who participated in the ideology of the cure for the poisonous taranta bite through music, dance and colors.

In delimiting the “objects” to be sampled — “the tarantati” — we thus left out any prejudicial medical evaluation of the crisis or any a priori belittlement of the traditional “cure,” accepting the popular religious consciousness’ own criterion and suspending analysis for a subsequent moment.

Once the objects had been determined, we decided to use the feast-day of Saints Peter and Paul (June 29) to carry out the sampling. On this occasion, the tarantati flock to the Chapel of St. Paul in the town of Galatina from various villages of the Salento, in order to thank the Saint for the recovery obtained during the home cure, to further confirm such a recovery, or to beseech him for it in the event that the home cure had not been carried out or had remained ineffective.

From June 28 to June 30 — during the days of the festive celebrations in Galatina — thirty-five tarantati were identified in the chapel in this manner; of these, nineteen were chosen at random for subsequent visits in their villages in order to gain a more complete picture, at least for these tarantati. During the visits to the Salentine towns, both before and after the holiday of June 29, we were told of tarantati who were not seen in the chapel, but we deliberately avoided visiting them so as to concentrate our attention exclusively upon those for whom we had observation data regarding their behavior in the chapel. In only two instances did we depart from this rule: for the sole confirmed case of latrodectism and for a tarantato who had long been hospitalized and was particularly interesting from a psychiatric point of view.

If we add these two cases to the thirty-five identified in the chapel and to the nineteen selected, we reach the figure of thirty-seven tarantati identified in the Salento in June 1959, and twenty-one tarantati as the research base. Since the visit to the chapel on the occasion of the feast-day of Saints Peter and Paul is generally mandatory for Salentine tarantati, their influx to Galatina from June 28 to June 30 was a significant indication of the dimension and diffusion of the phenomenon in the summer of 1959. However, it was only an indication, since some tarantati do not go to Galatina due to economic reasons, 1959 devotional ties to other saints (for example, St. Donatus or St. Foca), or simply because the seasonal crisis occurred in a period which was distant from the feast-day of Saints Peter and Paul; therefore, these tarantati were not observable in the chapel. In any case, from the thirty-seven tarantati identified and from occasional information gathered during our visits to Salentine villages, we may state that in the season of 1959, the tarantati of the Salento did not altogether number many more than one hundred. This figure includes those who in the 1959 season had suffered from the “first bite” as well as those — the vast majority, given the meager number of “new recruits” — who were subject to the seasonal repetition of the alleged “poisoning” according to a pattern which, as we will see, makes up one of the salient characteristics of tarantism as a historical-cultural phenomenon.

Tarantism solicits the participation in diverse capacities of musicians, family members, and an assorted audience of “believers” who throng at the doors of the hovels* where the home cures take place, or who form a circle around the dancing tarantato. Bearing this in mind, it seems reasonable to conclude — based on the data gathered in June and July 1959 — that tarantism in the Salento today directly influences the ideology and behavior of several thousand people, while the population’s attitude toward the phenomenon is variously nuanced according to social class, level of education, and everything else that conditions the cultural experience of individual people.

The ethnographic fieldwork of the summer of 1959 — given its motivations, the cultural premises which fostered it, and the working hypothesis it intended to test (that is, the hypothesis of tarantism as a cultural phenomenon, to be considered in a religious-historical evaluation) — imposed its own norms of methodological orientation in the field. As already stated in the Introduction, the first task facing us was that of evaluating the opposing hypothesis: the medical interpretation of tarantism as a disease. If this hypothesis were shown to be true (and we had a doctor with us precisely to test it), our whole investigation would have to be considered a failure, given the way in which we had approached it. There would be nothing left to do but break up the team, improperly led by a historian of religious life, when it should have been led by a doctor.

In particular, this task involved evaluating the two principal paths which medical investigation had followed up to this point in the literature on tarantism: the reduction of tarantism to a form of arachnidism and its reduction to a psychic disorder. In this matter, the team’s doctor had first leave to speak. He was expressly entrusted with the task of establishing how the phenomenon of tarantism fared among those who dealt with it in the dual medical perspective of its reduction to latrodectism or to some particular state of psychic abnormality. Now, as for latrodectism, the investigation carried out in the various hospitals of Lecce, Galatina, Maglie and Nardé, and with long-experienced municipal doctors, led to a substantially negative outcome. Latrodectism in the Salento is rare, in any case more so than in other regions of Italy. Of the twenty-one cases in our investigation’s base, scarcely one was traceable with certainty to an episode of latrodectism. However, even in this case, the initial toxic syndrome reminded readers familiar with the original Italian term "bassi" of these dwellings. TARANTISM AND DISEASE 23 fted onto the framework of tarantism — that is, onto the annual repetition crises and musical therapy, just as if once the toxic syndrome per se were . eo tarantism remained with its nexus of seasonal crises and traditionally Se caited symbolic horizons. On the other hand, bearing in mind the given cultural environment, the team doctor recognized that tarantism defied a ological definition within the framework of modern psychiatry. And even aie by case, the doctor could recognize symptoms of one illness or another et none at all, tarantism introduced determinants which lay outside his capacity, inasmuch as they could not in turn be qualified as “morbid symptoms” or “haviors.”! eh of the doctor was only negative: he said what tarantism was not, or more exactly, what it could not be “reduced” to. At precisely this point, we felt the necessity of a cultural analysis in order to confirm the doctor’s negation by its own means, and at the same time, fill in the gap left by this negation in a positive way. So, the research team identified a set of indications, all converging in a single direction and testifying in favor of the symbolic character and historical-cultural conditioning of tarantism. As soon as the team arrived “in the field,” the first indication to surface was that Galatina enjoyed the privilege of being “immune” to tarantism, due to the protection St. Paul bestowed upon it together with its “fiefdom. Thus, it would have been futile to look for tarantati in Galatina and the surrounding countryside included in the “fiefdom.” The word “fiefdom” calls to mind ancient social relations, long gone today; however in local linguistic usage, the expression “fiefdom of Galatina” was used above all to indicate a sacred delimitation — an area in which the tarante did not cause harm by concession of the Apostle to the Gentiles, who in Malta had dominated an echidna, a poisonous viper? that had freed itself from a bundle of sticks the Saint had thrown to stoke a fire. At one time, there must have been other areas of immunity in the Salento and throughout Apulia, under the protection of one saint or another. On the harsh, ravaged Adriatic coast of the Salentine Peninsula lies the small town of San Foca, where visitors to the church still receive discolored images of this Byzantine saint with the following caption: “St. Foca protects his devotees in a special way from the bites of insects and poisonous reptiles, such as tarante, vipers, etc.” In the past, the question of oases of immunity was complicated by disputes between the various religious orders and by the privileges which each boasted with respect to the others. The naturalist Paolo Boccone, a Cistercian monk who lived in the 1700s, informs us in his Museo di Fisica that in Brindisi and the Land of Otranto, no brother of the Observants of St. Francis was ever afflicted by the saranta, while the same could not be said of the Capuchins, whom the little creature sometimes harmed; however, if the tarantato Capuchin father was covered with the habit of an Observant, he was immediately cured with no need for music and dance.' Indeed, in the land of Brindisi, again in the 1700s, there was a monastery of the Observants, where in a cell built in St. Francis's day, the tarante never made their nests, thanks to the privilege of the Poor Man of Assisi, less compassionate toward the tarante of Apulia than he was toward the wolf of Agobbio. We do not know if real immunities [24 SALENTO 1959] corresponded to these claims of a more or less recent past, but as for Galatina and its fiefdom, the area actually did turn out to be immune in the heart of a region where tarantism was still relatively widespread. In fact, there were no tarantati in Galatina, nor [according to the people’s recollections] had there ever been in the past. During the feast-day of June 29, the rarantati who flocked to the city were all from other Salentine towns. Upon entering the fiefdom, they underwent a decisive experience for their crises, as if they had entered a sacred territory, a larger “templum” whose center was the chapel of Galatina. This indication, which immediately attracted our attention, already offered evidence in favor of the cultural conditioning of tarantism.

With the hypothesis that the phenomenon was to be reduced entirely to the real bite of a poisonous arachnid, it became a mystery as to why this arachnid’s toxicity was suspended only in Galatina, and why it operated just beyond the boundaries of the fiefdom, hardly a few kilometers away in towns like Cutrofiano, Galatone or Nardé, ruling out the possibility that changes in the diffusion of the fauna or a different frequency of man-spider encounters could in some way explain things. Instead, everything occurred as if a typically cultural shaping had come into play in tarantism’s manifestation: the belief in an area of immunity dependent on St. Paul’s protection and in the efficacy of a well containing miraculous water at the chapel of Galatina.

Very soon, this first indication was added to others which oriented the research in the same direction. One of the fundamental characteristics of tarantism, unanimously attested to by various authors from the 1600s on, was the possible and indeed very frequent repetition of the crises and cure each year for a variable number of years. There was a first bite treated at home through the use of music, dance and colors, but each year the crisis and treatment tended to be renewed, producing a regular, periodic series of “re-bites” and “un-poisonings.”® Moreover, the annual cure was followed by a visit to the chapel of Galatina, or —due to the evident disintegration of the phenomenon — the traditional cure was not practiced and the visit to the chapel remained. Of the twenty-one farantati who were the object of particular examination, only two were on their “first bite,” while many of the others had been tarantati for years, even decades (for example, forty-four, fifty-three, sixty years — cf. Table A).

Now, this protracted repetition of the crisis and the relative cure could not have any reasonable relation to a toxic syndrome resulting from the bite of a poisonous arachnid; in particular, latrodectism — the toxic syndrome from the bite of Latrodectus tredecimguttatus — was absolutely incompatible with the reproduction of the crisis over a period of decades. This repetition, so characteristic of tarantism, instead suggested a cultural conditioning, the respect of a tradition, the seasonal repetition of a rite, the calendrical celebration of a ceremony. Indeed, the tarantism observed in the course of our fieldwork not only was characterized by a generic elective period in the hot months, which could still have fit in with ® The book’s Italian title, La Terra del Rimorso, may be alternatively translated as “The Land of Re-bite,” a play on words in the Italian which alludes to the “re-bites” or relapses to which the tarantati are prey. Tarantism and Disease 25

Frequency of real man-spider occurrence

Exploded simultaneously in the chapel at Galatina on the very day of the feast (the afternoon of the 28th and the morning of the 29th), and notably less frequent after that date. In short, everything occurred as if the Christian cultural influence had sought to bend the pagan religious calendar, and as if it had partly succeeded in disciplining the onset of the crises to some degree; and despite eccentric behaviors such as occurring outside the usual date or even outside the season, everything appeared as if the conditioning were on the whole a success, introducing a milder tendency in the phenomenon.

Now, an assessment of this sort was undeniably compatible with the plasticity of a cultural phenomenon, but not with any kind of arachnidism. Concerning the differential participation of the two sexes in the phenomenon, observations were oriented in the same interpretive direction. Out of the seven farantati identified in the chapel in June 1959, thirty-two were females, delineating a prevalence which was too clear-cut to be casual. This fact became more significant since the historical documentation from the seventeenth century on confirmed the prevalence of female participation in tarantism, although in the past it was perhaps not so marked as today.

In the works of Bruni, Machiavelli, and De Raho, there are indeed sufficient indications to remove the question from merely impressionistic evaluations and establish the indicative value of such participation at the beginning of the 1600s, in the first half of the 1800s, and in the first decade of the 1900s. At the end of the seventeenth century, Baglivi was so struck by the predominant female participation in tarantism that he devised the solution of two tarantisms: one authentic, deriving from the poisonous spider bite, and the other spurious, "little carnivals of women."

The tradition of tarantism as a prevalently female phenomenon must have already been common at the end of the 1400s, if we are to judge by Pontano's dialogue Antonius, published for the first time in 1491. In it, he has Compatre say that in Apulia the women are in the habit of being bitten "quam saepissime" [as often as possible] by the taranta, and with this excuse they are permitted "libere atque — viros petere" [to ask for men freely and with impunity].

Moreover, if the results obtained on this point by the ethnographic exploration of 1959, together with the corresponding historical confirmations, are compared with the data reported by Bettini (1954) in relation to the distribution of latrodectism in Italy by sex during the period 1949-54, the discrepancy is evident. Of the 231 cases taken into consideration by Bettini, 181 are males and 50 are females — that is, the frequency for males is higher than the corresponding frequency for females in nearly every age group.

Analogously, in his monograph on One os the zone of Cerveteri from 1936 to 1952, Pampiglione notes thirty-four males out of forty-three cases. Data of this sort are in full agreement with the greater use of male laborers in agricultural work, and thus with a greater exposure of males to the danger of being bitten by Latrodectus. On the contrary, the clear-cut prevalence of female participation in tarantism did not fit in with the existing relation of employment of the two sexes in agricultural labor in the Salento. According to the census of 1951, in the province of Lecce, out of a resident population of 603,000 and a working population of 302,105, agricultural workers amount to 173,000, with 58,912 women. The local diffusion of tobacco cultivation and primary processing, with its predominantly female labor (60,000 women working in tobacco), does not significantly alter the fact that men participate more in agricultural labor, while women dominate tarantism.

Tarantism's antecedents date back to the Medieval period and the ancient world, while tobacco cultivation became more widespread in the Salento after feudalism and mortmain ended, with the agrarian bourgeoisie finding qualitative compensation in tobacco-growing for the quantitative loss of land. Tarantism was once widespread in all of Apulia and other provinces of the Kingdom of Naples, in areas where tobacco-growing was not practiced.

During the fieldwork of 1959, none of the 21 cases examined presented the episode of the "first bite" in connection with the tobacco harvest. The relation of the employment of the two sexes in agricultural work does not justify the prevalence of female participation in tarantism, which defers to other conditionings of a social-historical and religious-historical nature.

During the investigation, two indications argued against attributing tarantism to latrodectism and other forms of arachnidism. The first referred to the fact that tarantism had a distribution according to place, time, and sex, which was incompatible with such an attribution. The second concerned the age of the "first bite," with an indication in favor of the hypothesis that the "first bite" falls with greater frequency between the beginning of puberty and the end of the period of development. 

Obviously, the 15 entati who were taken as “samples” formed too limited a base to verify such a hypothesis statistically, but the qualitative analysis of the individual cases revealed it highly probable. Qualitative assessments of this sort were not lacking in the past in the literature on tarantism. Epifanio noted that tarantism could involve anyone, but more so during adolescence. centuries later, in his Osservazioni sul tarantismo di Puglia, read in the Accademia Medico-Chirugica of Naples, De Renzi mentioned the prevalence of tarantism in youth, in connection with the excitement of ane and "violent passions which belong to this age." The Apulian Giuseppe Chiaia somewhat maliciously noted how "the first vague restlessness of our pubescent youth, which elsewhere a prudent confessor would avert or mitigate with the abstinences of the Marian month or the one which follows, here in Apulia - sometimes resolved with guitar and tambourine." Local immunity, seasonal and calendrical repetition, an overwhelming prevalence of female participation, familial distribution, and the preference of the first bite for the age of the beginning of puberty and the end of development: all of these elements oriented the research toward a symbolic interpretation, an interpretation in which taranta, "bite," "poison," "crisis," "cure" and "recovery" acquired the meaning of mythical-ritual symbols, culturally conditioned in their functioning.

The symbolic autonomy of tarantism and its eer to latrodectism received further confirmation during the fieldwork, the problem of its relationship to latrodectism reappeared in a new form. As stated, one case out of the twenty-one considered, latrodectism was certainly the real occasion for tarantism. The case involved a peasant of the Arneo who, as have already mentioned, was stung by a Latrodectus one July night in a while sleeping near a threshing-machine. Within the real toxic syndrome, this man inserted a series of behaviors modeled after the cultural tradition of tarantism, annually reviving the event of his bite, poisoning and "cure" through music and colors. However, if for the nineteen cases in which the initial episode dated back to a more or less remote past (up to sixty years earlier!) we were currently dealing with latrodectism, we could not rule out the possibility that at least for some of these cases, the initial episode — the "first bite" — had really involved the sting of a Latrodectus. This hypothesis was all the more likely inasmuch as the case of the Arneo peasant demonstrated that at least once, this had been precisely so. The memories of the farantati and their families —to the extent that they were to be trusted — sometimes referred to symbolic situations "In Italian, the verbs "bite" (mordere) and "sting" (pungere, pizzicare) in this context are used interchangeably, although the two modalities of poisoning appear to be linked to different terms. The English translation reflects the connection among bite, re-bite, and remorse, and the significance of the Latin root pungere. Moreover, as will become apparent below, in the ideology of tarantism there are other means of "first bite" which have nothing to do with literal biting, such as being "sfiatato [hissed at] by a snake. Moreover, the preferred season for tarantism, from May to August, coincided with an intense period of agricultural work, especially with mowing, gleaning, and threshing. It coincided with the greatest diffusion, visibility, and aggressiveness of arachnids in general. Finally, and this was the most troubling datum, just as the cultural molding of tarantism was grafted onto the sole confirmed case of latrodectism, so, too, in the cases in which latrodectism was definitely not a factor, the crisis of tarantism more or less roughly imitated the toxic syndrome of latrodectism, precisely as if the cultural model of someone who “acts” poisoned had been copied as much as possible from real latrodectism.

Falling to the ground, a feeling of prostration, anguish, a state of psychomotor agitation with a beclouding of the sensory apparatus, difficulty in remaining standing, stomach ache, nausea and vomiting, various paresthesias and muscular pains, a heightening of sexual desire — these symptoms appeared in the moment of the crisis of tarantism even in cases, and they were the vast majority, in which other symptoms could lead to the certain exclusion of acute latrodectism, the result being an image of the poisoned victim which could easily deceive someone who was not a doctor.

From the cultural analysis, therefore, two apparently conflicting results emerged. On the one hand, there was the symbolic autonomy of tarantism and its irreducibility to latrodectism as evidenced by local immunities, the seasonal and calendrical repetitions, the overwhelming prevalence of female participation, a certain familial distribution of the tarantati, and the elective age of the first bite. On the other hand, the relation of tarantism to latrodectism was not incidental, as evidenced by other elements: the sole certified case in which tarantism had really begun with an episode of latrodectism, the probable indications to the same effect in the narratives of the tarantati and their families regarding the circumstances of the first bite, the coincidence of the preferred season of tarantism with a period of the agricultural year in which the danger of actually being bitten was greater, and finally, the rather rough imitation of the toxic syndrome of the Latrodectus bite by those tarantati who certainly did not display acute latrodectism.

The apparent conflict between these two orders of indications could not be resolved by sacrificing one of the two; indeed, both arose from exact observations and would have to be regarded as certainties. Thus, it was a matter of defining an interpretation which embraced and justified both in a coherent, unitary framework — which, again, could be done only through an appeal to a historical-cultural and religious-historical perspective.

Tarantism as a definite mythical-cultural horizon — as the bite of the poisonous taranta during the harvest season of summer’s fruits, returning each year to act as bite and poison, to be exorcised each year with music, dance, and colors — was not “reducible” to latrodectism, but neither was it “independent” of it, inasmuch as latrodectism had to be considered an important historical and existential condition for the genesis of tarantism. In the course of a certain cultural and religious history, the symbolism of the taranta had rendered itself autonomous from real episodes of latrodectism which were ae nee ‘yo summer agricultural tasks (perhaps at one time more frequen: t ie today). Such an autonomy took on two fundamental aspects: either the application of latrodectism simply became the opportunity for evoking and addressing other forms of "symbolic poisoning" in order to release and resolve individual traumas, frustrations, and unresolved conflicts. In this case, when the tarantism syndrome ran its course, the latrodectism remained, with its symbolic impression of annual repetitions and the corresponding musical, choreutic, and chromatic exorcisms.

At a higher level of symbolic activity, certain critical moments of existence, such as fatigue, the mid-life crisis, the death of a loved one, an unhappy love affair, or an unhappy marriage, women's condition of dependence, various family conflicts, and hunger, gave rise to "the crisis of the poisoned victim" using the model of latrodectism. This symbolic remodeling involved the bite of the taranta, which unleashed a crisis to be ritually controlled through the exorcism of music, dance, and colors.

The unitary interpretation agreed with the results of the case report and with the cultural analysis without sacrificing either. It explained why the tarantati, who were "currently afflicted with latrodectism," still imitated, more or less, the toxic syndrome. It also explained why the "first bite" was described with particular emphasis in situations connected with agricultural activities or symbolic situations, such as "stung by the window at noon," "stung after her father's death," "stung after dreaming of snakes," "stung while in prayer," "enchanted by a snake on the way to the sea," and "having seen a snake killed."

Such symbolic situations belonged to a subjective reconstruction of the facts by the victim or family, and they did not have per se any demonstrative force for ruling out an initial episode of latrodectism. However, their subjective reconstruction introduced particular determinations into the phenomenon and modeled behaviors, connecting itself to cultural elements and releasing symbolic efficacies.

The unitary interpretation also explained why, in the medical literature on tarantism from the seventeenth century to today, there were descriptions of cases suggesting latrodectism, while others seemed to involve an altogether different disease, or simply "little carnivals of the Salento." Finally, there was not an explanation for the phenomenon's characteristic cultural plasticity, which our investigation had so clearly evidenced and which was destined to elude every attempt at a "naturalistic reduction" of tarantism to a somatic or psychic disease. The historical-cultural interpretation in turn suggested an important methodological principle to be observed in the course of the ethnographic investigation of tarantism: that is, in all first bite situations, which by their nature rendered the objective reality of an arachnid's bite credible (agricultural work, etc.), two possibilities had to be borne in mind ~ that of an initial episode of latrodectism upon which the mythical-ritual symbolism of tarantism was subsequently grafted, and (much more frequent overall) that of an entirely symbolic bite, experienced in situations (agricultural work, etc.) in which the encounter with poisonous arachnids belonged to the order of traditional memories of the regime of peasant existence.

As the field investigation progressed, the cultural perspective in the interpretation of tarantism emerged as the most pertinent of all for the study of the phenomenon; even so, another hypothesis as to the origins of the phenomenon was also taken to the exact limits of its validity. This was the thesis recently advanced by Prof. Katner of Leipzig, in a monograph which was unfortunately elaborated without the aid of direct observation of the phenomenon. As we have already mentioned, the silence of our colleagues at the University of Bari led Prof. Katner to believe that the phenomenon was no longer observable in Apulia, and that therefore one could now only discuss it by referring to old historical descriptions and modern medical knowledge.

From a comparison of the data gathered by Epifanio Ferdinando and Baglivi with those resulting from clinical observations of heatstroke and sunstroke ~ particularly in the works of FA. Steinhausen (1910) and B.G. Maegraith (1952) — Prof. Katner thought it possible to conclude that the historical origins of tarantism were not in latrodectism, but instead in heatstroke or sunstroke. Without entering into the merits of a differential diagnosis conducted at such a distance in time and place and on the basis of seventeenth-century doctors' reports, it was the duty of our team — through the contribution of its doctor, who was prepared to deal with the question — to orient the fieldwork in such a way as to test the validity of this hypothesis.

Leaving aside the opinion of local doctors regarding the rarity of sunstroke in the region and the mild form it generally assumes, perhaps due to the windy climate, we found that out of the twenty-one tarantati examined, scarcely two cases were probably connected to an initial episode of sunstroke. This is a similar proportion to that of the other morbid connections noted. At any rate, these connections were clearly casual with regard to tarantism, which introduced autonomous determinants of a strictly cultural character.

Nonetheless, Katner's hypothesis highlighted an element which could have played an important part on the historical-cultural level. A certain analogy actually exists between the toxic syndrome of latrodectism and sunstroke; though the differential diagnosis is relatively easy, the two symptomatologies could be confused in a historical-cultural and religious-historical perspective. The ethnographic work revealed the possibility that not only the toxic syndrome of latrodectism but also sunstroke could have contributed to forming the culturally-based essence of tarantism, with its specific autonomy with respect to any other morbid state as such. In other words, the model eso fined victim — with its multiple symbolic meanings and its mythic aa oe form of the taranta—could have historically imitated real episodes al of latrodectism but also of sunstroke, fused together and remolded at i" Beeson cultural elaboration. The period of the harvest, with its decisive Be ential meaning for the grain-growing community and with the sa tensions to which individuals and social groups were subject, was - “oo of dangerous encounters with poisonous animals hidden in the wheat fields, on the vines, in vegetable gardens. But it was also the period of lengthy = to the fierce heat of the Mediterranean summer and of sudden sunstro “4 which upset the order of the harsh fatigue, taking away consciousness an sense. The “darts” of the sun’s rays, no less than the “bite of the poisoning animal, constituted a recurrent experience connected with that critical moment in peasant existence which is the epilogue to the agricultural year, the a of summer fruits. On this historically-defined existential terrain, the symbol = the biting taranta germinated in a form in which one who acted as the - victim in a symbolic sense imitated the behavior of someone who, stung by the spider or by the sun’s arrows, appeared to be in extreme danger. a In light of these results from the cultural analysis, it became c oar : we could not embrace the other interpretation of tarantism attempted by the doctors — its reduction to a psychic illness. In this regard, there was an old tradition in the literature on the topic. As far back as the 1600s, Epifanio Ferdinando,'* who was the first to systematically develop the thesis of tarantism asa real toxic state deriving from a spider’s bite (in the specific case, from the bite of the Apulian tarantula), recalled how in his time there were some “so — as to deny this disease, which in their opinion was traceable to a — disease, a melancholy or a form of dementia.” Subsequently, Tommaso Corne * whose name is so closely linked to the revival of Neapolitan cultural life in the second half of the seventeenth century, expressed the opinion that all of the tarantati were “lacking salt,” and that “for some particular indisposition [they] fall into a melancholy delirium, convinced — according to the popular a ~ that they have been bitten by the taranta.”'* Since then, the interpretation o tarantism which we would call psychopathological has had variable sec up to Giordano’s recent monograph on tarantism as a collective psychosis. : In ~ Once it was recognized that tarantism featured a typically cultural — an a definite order of mythical-cultural symbols belonging to a certain tra se every attempt at a psychopathological reduction of the a a me Tejected as inadequate. In the perspective of the cultural analysis,={ . did not manifest itself as a psychic disorder, but as a culturally con sae symbolic order (the exorcism of music, dance and colors), in which a wae ve _ crisis — again, culturally modeled (the behavior of the poisoned victim) — fou a2 SALENTO 1959 its solution. The neurotic crisis could appear connected to a real episode of latrodectism or to another organic illness, but what made up tarantism was the autonomy of its symbol, which gave a horizon to unresolved and latent psychic conflicts in the unconscious. Much more often the crisis sought out an opportunity, so to speak, by taking advantage of a “possible bite” situation (the harvest of summer fruits, sleeping in the fields, etc. The symbolic autonomy of tarantism manifests itself most clearly when we compare the myth of the taranta with spiders of modern zoology. In attempting to resolve the ill-conceived problem of which species of spiders the taranta corresponds to, we must consider the mythical taranta's preference for being identified with the spiders designated by modern zoology as Lycosa tarentula. The reasons for such a preference should not be judged in the negative framework of "more or less incorrect natural observations, but rather in the positive framework of a symbolic logic endowed with its own coherence, poetic and justifiable in the face of historical reason.

The Lycosa tarentula is a large, hairy, dark-colored spider with distinctive markings on its back and a dark streak against an orange-gray background on its belly. Armed with chelicerae of considerable size, everything in its appearance reinforces the image of the power to bite. On the other hand, the much fearsome but smaller and less conspicuous Latrodectus dyiibeltpentera does not provoke equally intense emotional reactions. Other preferential titles for Lycosa come from its habits. This spider normally lives in the fields, where it constructs an underground burrow, lying hidden during the day and coming out of hiding only rarely and for brief periods. In the night, it leaves its lair and roams in search of food. The Lycosa reaches its victim with a rapid run, jumping up to two palms; it makes this jump by lifting itself on its hind legs, its large chelicerae fanning out and ready to close in a bite, in a posture of vibrant aggressiveness. In the winter, the spider closes the opening to its lair and lives hidden inside; with the coming of the hot season, it molts its exoskeleton several times, mates and deposits eggs in a cocoon, from which the offspring emerge in the middle or end of summer.

The appearance of Lycosa, then, suggests a series of images, which are particularly suitable for providing a horizon for the obscure drives of the unconscious, to the alienation of a ciphered past that returns in the alienation of neurotic symptoms, for the inner bite which induces a search for "things that bite," for the dream of total renewal, eroticism and fertility — in conjunction, moreover, with the season for harvesting what has been sown and for paying debts incurred on the economic and existential levels.

The conspicuous appearance of Lycosa, its disturbing mobility, its aggressiveness and ferocity, and the coincidence between the harvest period and the season of renewal and fertile mating — these features all contribute to forming elective titles for refashioning this zoological species into a multifaceted symbol capable of giving a horizon to numerous "temptations" of the unconscious and their corresponding conscious reactions.

In short, the symbolic refashioning of Lycosa more or less recalls that of the mantide religiosa in R. Caillois' interpretation. As for Latrodectus, in this regard it does not possess the same titles as Lycosa. Indeed, it is not a very striking spider: its movements are slow, it weaves an irregular but very sticky web at the base of underbrush and grass, where it waits for insects to get trapped; it does not roam in search of food; it does not pursue its victim, but instead waits patiently for it in the middle of the web; it bites man above all when inadvertently squeezed by a hand or by the weight of a body (for example, handling the harvest or sleeping in the fields); finally, the bite of Latrodectus may pass momentarily unnoticed and may not even be attributed to the spider by its victim.

It is necessary, however, to add immediately that if the spider which modern zoology calls Lycosa tarentula enters into the symbolic weft of the taranta myth in a preferred way, this preference is only relative; other poisonous spiders, such as Latrodectus or the scorpion, or even a harmless spider like epeira could have contributed to the formation of that mythical mostrum which is the taranta of tarantism. Back in the eighteenth century, a doctor from Lecce named Nicola Caputo noted that all phalanxes were called tarantole in Apulia. And in fact, even today in the Salento one obtains responses in this regard which do not conform to the classifications of modern zoology. This, however, should not lead us to think of the taranta as a "confused notion" produced by bad observations and a scant respect for the rules of coherence. Rather, the taranta obeys the symbolic coherence of the myth, and the "confused notion" arises only in our minds as "learned" persons when we insist on measuring the symbolic coherence of the taranta by using the unsuitable unit of measure of naturalistic coherence. The unifying principle of the taranta myth is the symbolic horizon of the spider, which bites and ensnares with its bite. The differences between Lycosa, Latrodectus, the scorpion, and epeira are not as important as they are for someone who employs the criteria of zoological, toxicological, or medical research. In the perspective of the myth's symbolic coherence, Lycosa possesses some preferential titles for becoming symbolically refashioned, but other spiders can also lend their images wholly or in part for the construction of the mythical mostrum of the taranta without a contradiction being noticed in the least.

Other spiders, too, can be connected to the experience of an insidious, more or less poisonous bite, and can possibly be indicated as tarante: for example, Baglivi informs us that the scorpion entered into the framework of tarantism, and Boccone even coined the denomination of "scorpionati" to be placed alongside the traditional and popular one of "tarantati" or "attarantati."

Analogously, despite being so spicuous, the Latrodectus loaned its own select images to the myth of il 1a, images which are foreign to the behavior and habits of Lycosa but satisfy particular symbolic needs. For example, the image of the spider web in which the victim remains prisoner or that of the Bas swinging in the air and letting itself be carried by the wind are foreign to but borrowed from the behavior and habits of Latrodectus.

During our research, we were able to affirm how the initial episode that spawned tarantism was at times not even ascribed to a spider. For example, we found that the person had been "sfiatato by a snake (see Table A). In this case, even the person who was "sfiatato by a snake behaved like a tarantato; he was considered as such by people and was treated with the musical exorcism without any contradiction being noticed.

The economy of the mythical symbol of the taranta with regard to naturalistic observation is also manifested in the symbolism of poison and effects. From the point of view of toxicology and modern medicine, Lycosa provokes in man a local reaction that is sometimes severe (hyperemia, localized necrosis), but general effects that are scant and light. In contrast, the local effects of the bite of Latrodectus are modest, but the systemic ones are very serious. The mythical-ritual symbol of the taranta is interestingly oriented toward the spider that gives more imposing local effects, the Lycosa, but at the same time, as we stated above, it models the crisis as an imitation of the more serious toxic state—the one inflicted by the bite of Latrodectus.

Taranta, bite, and poison thus have a symbolic meaning in tarantism: they give a horizon to the unconscious drives and reactions they provoke in an individual consciousness. In this horizon, taranta, bite, and poison enter into a series of relations among themselves and with other determinants, to such a degree that they are arranged in a framework which possesses—again, on the level of symbolic logic—its own coherence. Above all, to perform its function as a symbol, the taranta must evoke, configure, revive, and release the obscure stimuli of the unconscious that risk submerging consciousness with their ciphered indomitability. The taranta has various sizes and different myths narrating it; it dances to different melodies, and its bite is linked to its size, color, choreutic dynamism, and melody. The taranta with a person's name, such as Rosina, Peppina, or Maria Antonietta, represents a particular affective tone reflected in the person bitten.

The taranta can be a "dancer" or "singer," sensitive to music, song, and dance, or it can be "silent" and request "funeral dirges" and other melancholy songs. There are also "tempestuous" ones that induce their victims to "go on a rampage" and "libertines" that urge them to mimic lascivious behavior. Finally, there is the "sleeper" taranta, resistant to any musical treatment whatsoever.

The taranta instills a poison in the veins that lasts as long as the taranta lives or until its offspring dies. It bites in the summer season, but it is possible that the bite endured in one summer "re-bites" in the next, meaning that the taranta has not "dropped dead" yet, or that it has passed on its disastrous inheritance to its sisters, daughters, or granddaughters.

The symbol of the taranta does not exhaust its function only through configuring; it also resolves and releases what is configured. The grafting of the actual ritual "plan" of tarantism is feasible if the taranta is a "dancer." The "sleeper" taranta marks a limit to the efficacy of the symbol in action, the possibility that it might not operate.

To make the taranta "croak" or "drop dead," it is necessary to mimic the dance of the little spider - the tarantella. It is necessary to dance with the spider, indeed be the dancing spider, but also to make an actual agonistic moment be felt - the superimposition and imposition of one's own choreutic rhythm upon that of the spider.

The tarantato executes the dance of the little taranta (the tarantella) as a victim possessed by the beast and as the hero who subdues the beast by dancing. This is carried out through the tension between "identification" and "agonistic detachment," "letting go" and "regaining oneself," and "making oneself a spider" and "dancing the spider."

During the agonistic identification of the choreutic-musical exorcism, the combatant sometimes dialogues aloud with the spider, submitting to its orders or managing to impose his own command. He comes to terms with it and has it set the length of the choreutic performances or the time of the next crisis. This is, in essence, the symbol of the saranta as a mythical-ritual horizon for evoking, configuring, releasing, and resolving unresolved psychic conflicts that "re-bite" in the obscurity of the unconscious. As a cultural model, this symbol offers a mythical-ritual order for settling these conflicts and reintegrating individuals into the group. The symbol of the taranta lends a figure* to the formless, rhythm and melody to menacing silence, and color to the colorless in an assiduous quest of articulated and distinct passions, where a horizonless excitation alternates with a depression that isolates and closes off. This symbol offers a perspective for imagining, hearing, and watching what we lack imagination for and are deaf and blind to, and which nevertheless peremptorily asks to be imagined, heard, and seen. In such a perspective, nothing is more pertinent than a spider that bites and poisons with its bite and the project of courageously becoming the poisonous spider, while at the same time fighting to free oneself from it. And in the same perspective, nothing is more d Secondly, scazzicare denotes the specific stimulation that comes from music and colors, inasmuch as they are symbols of an exorcism which evokes latent urgings in the state of total inertia; rather than release these urges in an incoherent psychomotor excitation, this stimulation releases them in a ceremonial order dominated by dance figures and the other symbolic themes of tarantism in action. For this reason, the traditional plan of behaviors included in tarantism foresees a band that is placed next to the inert tarantato, and which then begins a musical exploration to define the “right” music — the music of the taranta involved in that particular case. The “right” music will move the tarantato to scazzicare, but do so according to the ways of the ritual, abandoning the state of inertia and bending the psychomotor agitation to the rhythm of the music and the figures of the dance. At the same time, an attempt is made to provide the tarantato with the “right” colors in the form of colored ribbons — that is, the Colors of the taranta that bit him. The right colors will be the ones that cause the tarantato to scazzicare in an alternation of repulsions and attractions, of aggressive outbursts and idolizations, but once again, in the framework of a defined ceremonial order, disciplined by an exorcism in action.

The connection between this word and tarantism probably explains why, in one of the meanings noted by Rohlfs, it also denotes a difficulty in standing up (mi scazzicu =I stand up with difficulty); this appears to symbolize the state of inertia, prostration and weariness which, together with the disorderly motor release, makes up the “crisis” moment of tarantism. But let us now turn to individual persons in order to concretely analyze the functioning symbol.

When the team reached Galatina on June 20, 1959, their first concern was that of obtaining the opportunity to attend one of the home exorcisms which, as noted, became more numerous in the Salentine towns with the coming of the feast-day of June 29. But this was not an easy task, since they lacked a network of informants in the province who could notify them in time when individual cases unpredictably took place, these being few in each season and scattered over a relatively wide area. They confided their concerns to the manager of the Cavallino Bianco, who told them that once — before opening his sunny, precarious little hotel — he had “played” for tarantati, and that in Nardo he knew two brothers who were still actively employed as musicians.

So, in the late afternoon of the 24th, the team left with him for Nardo in search of the two brothers, who had a barbershop in the center of the town, readapting the old tradition of the barber-phlebotomist to local therapeutic needs. The two brothers were not in the shop, but the shop-boy told them that the older one was at that very moment playing for a tarantata in a nearby alley. And indeed, lending an ear, they could hear the echo of a rustic concertino dominated by the pressing rhythm of the tambourine. With the shop-boy’s summary indications and, understandably, a certain suspense, the team got moving on the trail of the rhythm. And there, about a hundred meters into the forest of alleyways, the concertino became increasingly distinct. The rhythm of the tambourine revealed the melodic line of the “dance of the little spider” — the tarantella; it was the ancient tarantella of the South in its original therapeutic function, just as it was heard by Epifanio Ferdinando, Baglivi, Fathers Nicolello and Galliberto, Valletta, Caputo and all of the others who from the 1600s until today had, with various thoughts on the matter, directed their “pity” toward the singular human document of tarantism. Discerning a crowd of persons outside of a hovel, we immediately located the house from which the sounds emerged. We quickened our step and were in front of the door; we made our way through the crowd, bestowing a plain smile upon the many eyes in the process of asking, “Who are these strangers?” And finally, out of the blue, from day to night, we found ourselves brutally hurled onto another planet.

The room, the only one in the miserable dwelling, received light from the door and from a little window, so small and high that everything would have been wrapped in semi-darkness if two candles had not given the interior an unstable glimmer. Against the wall facing the entrance lay a disheveled bed, leaning down to the floor as if to help someone slide to the ground were he unable or unwilling to get up with his own force. Above this strange alcove, some sacred images in a frame of paper flowers formed a rustic little altar on the wall. On the night table next to St. Peter and a carafe, the bed, there were pictures of St. Peter and a miraculous water, drawn from the well in Galatina.* The room reduced of what little furniture normally belonged to it, and chairs were placed all around for the musicians and audience. A large red cloth screened the fireplace, on whose mantle a crucifix had been placed in such a way that it would easily have seemed a cascade of blood gushing out of the wounds of Jesus. To delimit the scenario of the ritual or ceremonial perimeter of the floor, the floor of the room was covered by a wide sheet laid over some straw in a corner of the sheet there was a basket for the collection of donations. Here, within the area marked by the white canvas, the tarantata performed, dressed in white with a sash and her black Philadanas upon which she danced, her waist tied with ecstatic loosened and falling in her olive face, where one could see sternly immobile and hard traits and eyes like a sleepwalker's, which opened and then partially shut. In the meantime, the guitarist, the accordionist, the tambourinist and our barber-violinist performed in turn in this vibrant event of therapy.

In the meantime, the guitarist, the accordionist, the tambourinist and our barber-violinist performed in turn in this vibrant event of therapy.

Finally, after some effort at justifying our presence among our hosts (we were en who had come from Rome to study this strange disease), we were accepted, and we joined the audience circle and began to observe with ease. The young tarantata, a twenty-nine-year-old bride, regularly repeated a definite choreutic cycle, articulated partly on the floor and partly on her feet, and always finishing with a fall to the ground which marked a sort of rest. Beginning with this interval, during which the band played the tarante, the tarantata, lying supine on the ground, immediately began to move with the sounds, moving her head left and right to the tempo. Then, as if the sonorous wave had propagated itself throughout her body, she moved to her back, pushing herself with the movement of flexed legs and ally planting her heels on the floor. Her head continued to strike the tempo violently, and the movement of her legs itself strictly obeyed the rhythm of the tarante. In this way, with her arms outstretched, the tar______ Then, she suddenly turned face vs: - legs spread immobile, her arms bent below her bust and then = = - her head still in rhythmic motion with her great mane ee ~ visibly mimed a creature incapable of standing erect and which was practically stuck to the ground — that is, the taranta. She was living out her identification with the taranta, dancing with it — indeed, she was the dancing beast itself.

This moment of predominant identification with the spider was followed by wee eee of agonistic detachment: the tarantata jumped to her feet - — Ceremonial perimeter several times with a lively single or double hop, som 40 SALENTO 1959 hopping in place, and occasionally forming some of the well-known figures of the traditional tarantella with the help of a colored cloth which she held in her hands (for example, arms slackened at her hips, holding the cloth at both ends; arms high and taut, holding the cloth at its ends above her head; arms flexed, one raised, the other lowered to her back, holding the cloth at its ends behind her back; etc.). During this phase, as in the preceding one, the tarantata strictly observed the rhythm; her dancing feet consistently beat the ground fifty times every ten seconds.

Finally, after a duration which was variable but never exceeded a quarter of an hour, the entire choreutic cycle drew to a close; the circle of its path began to tighten, her stability became uncertain, the rhythm was no longer followed with the usual rigor, and everything ended with a frenetic caracole which announced the fall that was near at hand, as if it were the result of her dizziness. With outstretched arms, women attendants formed a tight circle around the éarantata in order to block any careening or harmful falls, and they tried to hold her in their arms when the fall, disorderly but not violent, took place at the peak of the caracole (see photos 1-9).

The band stopped playing, the tarantata was brought a glass of water and a pillow upon which to lay her head, and the musicians had their abundant sweat dried off by those present. Then, after a rest of about ten minutes, the band again took the initiative and the cycle was repeated in the exact same phases.

Throughout the entire performance of June 24, we noticed some interesting details. In both the phase on the floor and in the phase on her feet, the tarantata sometimes lingered for a while near the musicians as if she were fascinated by some instrument, nearly always the tambourine or violin. Her behavior and appearance demonstrated a desire to avidly absorb the rhythm of the tambourine and the melody of the violin, as if to evoke something critical to her whole being. In their turn, the musicians appeared to support these momentary inclinations which occasionally cropped up in the performance of the tarantata; in a passionate musical offering, they placed one instrument or another near her ears as the opportunity arose.

In the phase on the floor, we once saw the tarantata drag herself to the feet of the violinist, and she lingered there as if she were magnetized. The violinist then knelt down next to her, playing so closely over her that it seemed that the bow had the woman’s body for its violin. At that moment, we recalled the song which was part of the repertory administered to tarantati in the seventeenth century: "And indeed, everything was taking place before our eyes as if the body-taranta of the tarantata were transforming itself into a body-instrument, and thus into a rhythmic and melodic body, so as to reestablish a connection with some ciphered psychic distress. The musicians were the mediators, stimulators, and guides of this event: in the standing phase, when the farantata—still hopping with the tempo—lingered in front of them among them, the tambourinist often made the rhythmic striking of the 4 pourine explode right next to her ears, with a swinging motion of both arms, which gave the sonorous medicine the aspect of a beneficial spraying or even a justration. Just as often, the violinist bent toward the figure dancing next to or in front of him and communicated a very personal message of sound to her, and the end of which the magnetization ceased and the dancing figure returned to her rhythmic run around the ceremonial perimeter.

Another detail we noted had to do with chromatic symbolism. At a certain int in the event, a young man with a red- and yellow-striped shirt appeared at the door for a few moments. The tarantata, who was performing the upright phase in one of her choreutic cycles, immediately entered into a state of agitation; she no longer danced to the tempo and gave clear signs of interrupting the relationship which bound her to the musicians, the instruments, and the music. In their turn, having perceived the disarticulation of the ceremonial performance, those present crowded near the door, shouting at the incautious youth that he had altered the apparatus's functioning with the red and yellow of his shirt. The youth entrusted his legs with a rapid escape from the threats and accusations. However, it was necessary to repair the apparatus, which still did not function; the tarantata careened here and there as if she were intoxicated, and the band played in vain despite its desperate calls for redirecting the rebel planet back into orbit.

There was only one way to repair the broken apparatus: throw yellow and red ribbons on the tarantata and let her vent the eccentric stimulation they provoked. Someone saw to procuring the necessary ribbons, and since it was not known which of the two colors was at issue, the members of her family began to test her, First they threw a yellow ribbon on the tarantata without obtaining any effect, and then they threw a red one, which turned out to be the pertinent one since the tarantata flung herself upon it and savagely grabbed it; she stared at it with a gloomy, avid look as if to absorb the color, and finally she tore it with her teeth and executed some rapid, decisive somersaults. The tarantata then placed herself back into the regular orbit of her ceremonial performance, allowing the band—which in the meantime had continued to play—to regain its mastery and control of her. The damage was repaired, the speck of dust which had filtered into the gears was eliminated, and the apparatus functioned again to the satisfaction of all.

The musical-choreutic-chromatic exorcism of June 24 terminated toward evening in the most obvious way—with the musicians' fatigue." They had been working since the morning and were fully entitled to a rest, all the more so since the choreutic cycles followed each other without interruption, except for a pause of an hour and a half around noon. So, around ten o’clock, at the end of a choreutic cycle, the band set down their instruments and the tarantata was carried off to bed, where she lay tired, with her eyes closed. Yet, it could not be said the she was exhausted and incapable of continuing with her choreutic Performance. With a low and colorless voice she answered questions put to her by her family: “How do you feel?” “Better.” “Did the Saint speak to you?” “Not yet.” “Will he speak to you tonight?” “I don’t know.” But she remained stubbornly silent to many questions. The last two questions referred to dialogues between tarantati and St. Paul, who, because of the Christian graft of the Saint as protector of the tarantati, became associated with the traditional theme of dialogue between the tarantato and the taranta. At any rate, in our case the Saint had not yet granted the grace,‘ and the treatment would have to continue through the next day.

The group was about to break up when a choleric, thickset little man suddenly burst into the hovel; he started shouting, yelling and giving orders with the air of being the boss of everyone and everything. He ordered the people to leave and to clear the room, protesting the presence of “outsiders” and especially the photographer who had transformed the scene into a circus act. We learned that this imposing character was the owner of the farm where the tarantata was currently a day-laborer. We also learned that he was in a certain sense the patron of the festival, because he had advanced the money to pay the musicians with the aim of effecting the cure and thereby regaining his worker — temporarily indisposed by the taranta — as quickly as possible. Later on there would always be time to get his money back in the form of unpaid workdays, which the tarantata would give him after having received the Saint’s grace.

The following morning the team returned to Nard to be present when the tarantata awoke and the new series of choreutic cycles began. When the musicians struck their first chords around 10:00am, the tarantata remained immobile in bed, but when the tarantella broke out, the opening of the ritual day was signaled by a very loud yell accompanied by a bridge-like arching of her body. It was a classic hysteric arch, of the sort which nowadays one only reads of in books: heels planted, neck hyper-extended, arms half-bent, and body hyper-flexed. The “bridge” lasted a few seconds before the tarantata turned supine, but by then she was permeated with the sound wave; she moved to the music’s tempo, her legs, arms and body all limbered for the dance. The inclined plane of the bed facilitated her slide to the floor, where she immediately rose to her feet, sketching in an abbreviated form the upright phase of the first cycle in the series. After hardly a minute, she fell down and began the phase on the floor, and from that moment on, everything resumed according to the schema of the day before.

After an interruption from noon to one o’clock and the resumption which followed, we perceived that something decisive was on the way. The faces of her family members were less worried, and the people exchanged knowing glances as if to say, “Maybe we’ve done it.” In one of the pauses we asked our barber-violinist what his prognosis was; he shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows in an act of dignified professional caution, then, assuming the sure and bureaucratic tone of a railway employee giving information on train timetables to a passenger, he told us: “The Saint does the grace at twelve, one, three or five. “If the grace doesn’t come at five o’clock, we'll have to wait till tomorrow.” Then he showed us his wrist watch, which indicated half past two, accompanying the gesture with an expression that meant, “Figure it out for yourselves.” In fact, as we learned from those present, hopeful signals had come forth: the tarantata had accepted a little food during the noontime rest, and in the course of the afternoon performance, she had “barked” several times—that is, she emitted small cries not unlike a dog’s bark—these being signs of a grace on the way. Last, there was another promising sign in the fact that the tarantata began to execute briefer choreutic gestures, during which her behavior appeared freer and more varied in its figures.

In this way, while everyone probed these signals with trepidation, the tarantata suddenly interrupted one of her innumerable rhythmic runs near the ceremonial perimeter, gestured to the musicians to stop playing, and headed with sure step to the bed, where she lay herself down; she looked at the scene a bit astonished and hinted at a smile. The grace had come at exactly 2:55, five minutes earlier than the foreseen hour; the emotion of her family and those present was great, while from afar, the barber-violinist indicated to us the hands of his wrist watch, as if to invite us to verify the substantial exactness of his predictions.

Then the band struck up a tarantella of thanks to the Saint, with the subsidiary aim of making sure that the tarantata was truly indifferent to the stimulus of music and dance. But the tarantata remained immobile on the bed, serene and continuing to watch. Then the tambourinist fell to his knees, followed by all those present, and led prayers of thanks to the Saint. Mixed in with the crowd, the members of the research team were also on their knees, some with embarrassment and others with a slight excitement.

As soon as it was possible, the team’s doctor asked the tarantata some explorative questions, and from the replies he obtained, he was able to deduce that her notion of time had remained suspended from the previous day, when the exorcism had begun (she thought it was Thursday, when it was actually Friday). She knew that she had danced, but did not remember anything of what had taken place during the dance. Among other things, she did not recall that the team members were present for her choreutic performances, and indeed, she believed that they had entered the hovel for the first time that very moment.

As for the concluding episode of the grace, she reported to have suddenly heard the Saint’s voice, which, in a low tone and in dialect, had distinctly murmured in her ears, “I am doing the grace for you.” The tarantata answered the doctor’s questions as if submerged in a sweet languor, answering with some delay, slowly, in a soft voice, saving her words.

At a certain point, the tarantata expressed the desire to go immediately to Galatina to thank the Saint, so we offered to take her in our car. The offer was accepted, but her family warned us to be careful upon entering the fiefdom, because the tarantata—even though she was now calm—would inevitably be agitated in the fatal moment of crossing. And indeed, when a certain tree which serves as a mystical boundary-marker appeared in the car window, the tarantata had a moment of abandon, which she came out of right away. We arrived at the chapel of Galatina; the tarantata entered, and in the form of an homage to the Saint, she repeated the choreutic cycle performed during the home exorcism without any musical accompaniment, but the rhythmic run in a circle was transformed into circles around the altar. Then she drank a glass of water drawn from the miraculous well, and lastly 44 SALENTO 1959 — the final act — she carefully placed all of the money collected in the two days of dancing in the donations box. The tarantata would return to Galatina on June 29 to join the other women and participate in the chapel scenes; for now, however, everything was over, and there was nothing left for us to do but take her back to Nard, where we left her. However much the exorcism of June 24 and 25 allowed us to capture the mythical-ritual symbol of the taranta in its concrete functioning, the tarantata still remained for us more of a shadow than a person. She appeared to us in the act of pouring her own particular psychic drama into the mythical-ritual pattern offered by tarantism, but what the content of this drama might be was still unknown to us. The tarantata had mimed the agonistic identification with the ¢aranta that bit her, and with the aid of St. Paul, protector of tarantati, she freed herself from the poison, at least until the next calendrical period. But if “the taranta,” “the poison,” and “St. Paul” were symbols, it now remained to establish what concrete psychic drama they were a symbolic horizon for in this specific case. Thus, in the following days, the team was occupied with reconstructing this drama as much as possible, or at least delineating its probable lines of development. The tarantata — to whom we will now give the pseudonym Maria of Nardo*’— was a tobacco harvester and gleaner, and had been married to a peasant for nine years. At age thirteen she lost her father, to whom she had been particularly attached, “because he brought her things from the market.” After this tragedy, she was taken in together with her mother into an uncle’s home and subsequently that of an aunt. Always badly tolerated by whoever hosted her and not getting along well with her mother, she passed her adolescent years in all sorts of trouble. At age eighteen she fell in love with a young man, but for economic reasons his family opposed marriage, and the youth left her. Maria suffered a great deal for this abandonment, since it was her first love; and suddenly, “one Sunday at noon,” she was bitten by a taranta while at a window and was compelled to dance. In the meantime, a woman with a son to marry off had set her sights on her; it seemed to this woman that Maria could be a possible wife for her sickly and often unemployed son, even if she was tarantata. The mother and son sometimes accompanied Maria to the chapel in Galatina to render homage to the Saint, and on one of these occasions, the mother asked Maria if she would have her son as a husband. Maria, who still held her first love in her heart, did not speak her mind, and to buy time she presented the excuse of not having money for her trousseau because of the taranta which forced her to dance and incur constant debts with the musicians. The mother and son did not give up, and they continued to solicit the girl; in the meantime a new character entered the scene, St. Paul, who appeared to Maria and ordered her not to marry, calling her to a mystical marriage with him. To bring the situation to a head, the mother and son one day sent a woman to Maria’s home; this woman asked Maria to follow her because the two wanted to speak to her. Maria was led outside the village to a farmhouse where the mother and son were waiting for her. They proposed the usual means practiced in this area for precipitating a marriage — running away from home and living for a period more uxorio. Maria reluctantly gave in to their insistence and moved into the farmhouse. A few days later, Maria woke up weak and without appetite, uninclined to do the household chores. In a rather rough manner, her concubine ordered her to iron the linens, and a quarrel broke out.

Maria finished the ironing and, on her way to a neighbor's house to return the iron, she met Saints Peter and Paul on the road, who told her: ‘Forget the iron and come with us.” “But who will take care of my husband?” “Don’t worry about your husband,” was the reply. It was Sunday, at noon, on the exact day and time in which she had been bitten by the taranta for the first time and had received the first summons from St. Paul. After having roamed in the fields for three days, Maria returned to her family. Unhappy with her because she had disobeyed his order not to marry, St. Paul had her stung once again, forcing her to dance for nine days. In any case, the whole neighborhood knew that she had been in the farmhouse with the youth, and to repair the damage a wedding was now necessary, even if she and the Saint found it displeasing. The conflict reached a compromise in this way: Maria agreed to a wedding with her new suitor — her current husband — but at the same time, she maintained her seasonal relationship with the taranta and the Saint, renewing the crises and dances each year, with a conspicuous preference for the hottest months, her menstrual period and the arrival of the feast-day in Galatina.

The interpretation to be given to this story, made out from discussions with the tarantata and her family, does not seem very difficult. The “first bite” took place right after her disappointment in love, showing its symbolic character even in its attribution of a day and hour which are canonical in tarantism. On the occasion of the first bite, a pact of loyalty and mystical marriage to St. Paul was made; what was not possible on earth was projected into heaven, and St. Paul constituted the sublimated figure of her first unlucky love. On the same day and at the same hour as those of the first bite, the jealous Saint came to take her from the farmhouse to which she had fled, violating their pact, and he punished the betrayal by renewing the “bite” and “poison,” forcing her to dance. Compelled by circumstance to marry a man whom she did not love, Maria periodically continued to pay her tribute to the taranta and the Saint, each time reciting the event of the bite of love in the symbolism of the ritual, and each time being cured through the grace of her heavenly husband, the projection and sublimation of the ground she had irremediably lost. In the mythical-ritual horizon of tarantism and the Christian graft of St. Paul’s figure, Maria periodically released her conflicts and converted her frustrations into symbol, lightening the periods between ceremonies — that is, daily life — of the burden of unconscious stimulations which would have been extremely dangerous had she not found a socialized and traditionalized project of calendrical, festive treatment in tarantism. Through the mythic order of “taranta,” “bite,” “poison,” and St. Paul, Maria gave a form to frustrating psychic conflicts, and through the ritual order of music, dance, and colors, she got in touch with these conflicts through an annual treatment which evoked them in time and place and made them communicate with the plane of symbolic creations proposed by the Myth. At the same time, Maria released aggressive drives against her undesired husband in an alienated form; she upset her conjugal life, economically harmed her family, and clamorously drew public attention—normally uninterested in her—to her drama. The seriousness of Maria’s personal and social conflicts found an echo in the responses to Rorschach Cards II, V, VII, and IX, which manifest macabre, aggressive, and violent themes. During the administration of the word-association test, Maria replied to the word "bite" [morso] with "remorse [rimorso, also 're-bite'], what makes you cry."6

From a theoretical point of view, a case of tarantism observed in a "complete" fashion would involve the possibility of catching the episode of "first bite" and the "first crisis" in action, of being present at the first musical-choreutio-chromatic exorcism and following the subsequent periodical connections between the renewed crises and the repetition of the ceremonial treatment from year to year, with all of its possible annual variations. Moreover, such a case would permit the reconstruction of the psychic biography of the tarantato, starting with his infancy, utilizing all of the instruments for the analysis of the unconscious which modern psychology has at its disposal.

Obviously, none of the cases we observed fulfills these requirements, in the first place because of the limited time the team was in the field (from June 22 to July 10), and in the second place because the instruments of analysis available to us did not go beyond standard ethnographic recording obtained through interviews based on structured questionnaires, the psychiatrist's evaluation, the administration of the Rorschach test, and a word-association list.

In any case, even if in a purely relative sense, the case of Maria of Nardé was one of the most complete the team managed to observe, and it served to orient the study as a whole by posing a series of problems and stimulating us to cross-check and supplement the data as other cases gradually came forth. Among other things, the case of Maria of Nardé had highlighted how tarantism constituted a symbolic apparatus for evoking and configuring on the mythical-ritual level those psychic conflicts which had not found a resolution on the level of consciousness and which operated in the darkness of the unconscious, with the risk of appearing as neurotic symptoms. These conflicts were periodically released and produced on the mythical-ritual level, relieving the periods between ceremonies of the weight of their urges, and facilitating a relative psychic equilibrium in those periods.

In this way, we outlined the possibility of considering tarantism in a perspective in which certain conflicts found a horizon in a symbolic system of "first bite" and "re-bites" lived out according to traditionalized and socialized ways, times, and places: the ways of the musical-choreutic-chromatic exorcism, the times of the seasonal and festive calendar, the places of home, fiefdom, and chapel.

The very day of June 24, a few hours before leaving for Nard6, where we were to encounter the case of Maria, at the chapel of Galatina we had the opportunity to observe another case of particular interest for illustrating the symbolic-cultural autonomy of tarantism. This was the case of a seventy-one-year-old peasant woman, Filomena of Cerfignano, whom we saw seated in the chapel on the altar's steps in the act of reciting the misfortune which had befallen her, in keeping with ceremonial procedure. At her feet, there was a branch of chick peas, to which the tarantata seemed bound by a particular affective relationship (see photos 27-29). Filomena lamented of her illness THE SYMBOLIC AUTONOMY OF TARANTISM 47 Per en, legs, kidneys, her head, and a precordial heaviness. She invoked St. Paul: “My great Saint, do the e a me! I didn’t do anything to you! Don’t use the poison again!” It was confirmed by her husband and daughter and verified a few days later - ae visit to Cerfignano, it turned out to be an episode of “first bite,” ee ontting had been a threshing-floor in front of the rustic house in which Filomena and her husband lived. Five days earlier, at “noon,” while she was seated on the threshing-floor picking chick peas from a branch (the very same cone lying at her feet in the chapel), a small argument arose with her husband, and just then the taranta stung her. Filomena saw it flee down her leg, where it left a dark little mark, and she had no doubt as to what had happened to her. She stood up yelling and entered the house, where she saw a small “green spider near the bed, the very one responsible for the attack a few moments earlier. Someone in the research team objected that the taranta could not have had the time to move all the way over there, but Hilomenss husband replied that “these spiders fly with the wind by making long threads”; in his “myth” of _ the taranta, he evidently used an image relevant to Latrodectus but not Lycosa; as we stated above, Latrodectus actually does move about hanging by threads which allow it to be transported by the wind. Filomena was also asked why she had not killed the taranta at the moment of the sting or when “she saw it near the bed, and she replied that the saranta was “a creature of St. Paul and to kill it would have been an offense to the Saint. Her husband, for his part, confirmed that the taranta had been “sent” by the Saint. After the episode of the threshing-floor and the sighting of the taranta, Filomena began to feel a pain rising up from the site of the sting to her abdomen, and then she felt the _ other symptoms from which she was still suffering. The very day of the first bite, Filomena headed for the chapel in Galatina, but the visit had no effect. An old woman in the chapel reminded her that in order to be cured, it was necessary to wear the clothes she wore at the moment of the “first bite’ and to ¢arry the most important objects which had a reference to the situation in which the first bite had taken place. So Filomena returned to Cerfignano; she dressed herself exactly as she was dressed when she was stung and took the branch of chick peas which she had in her hand at that moment. Thus refashioned, so to speak, in the evocative images of the initial scene which had marked the onset of the crisis, Filomena returned to the chapel. Her husband explained to us that his wife had not been bitten by a “dancer,” “singer” or “libertine” taranta, and therefore she did not dance; she did not feel stimulated by lively songs, nor did she abandon herself to lascivious mimicry. Her taranta was just “sad and Silent,” disdaining the rhythm of the tarantella and inducing a melancholy state of mind in its victim which was best expressed with a funeral lament. The data which it was possible to gather on Filomena’s story did not permit Us to decide exactly what the conflict was in this case that had found its symbolic horizon in tarantism. In point of fact, we could not completely rule out the possibility that five days earlier a real episode of arachnidism had taken place, however much this appeared highly improbable. It was clear in any case—16 THE LAND OF REMORSE—only through an abstraction which was as necessary as it was provisional; this abstraction was all the more legitimate in its methodological rigor in that some indirect indications which emerged from it suggested that another, differently oriented and structured team could confront the situation in the perspective of possible modification and intervention. So it was established that the social worker, in the person of Vittoria De Palma, would have as her principle task that of facilitating relations between the team and the tarantati for the purposes of a study oriented in a religious-historical sense, but without losing sight—secondarily and with extreme discretion—of the gradual configuring of the other perspective as the fieldwork and interpretation of the data proceeded (see Appendix 5).

We spent the spring of 1959 at our center conducting a seminar in preparation for the fieldwork. This involved establishing a first contact with the literature on the subject, agreeing upon a common scientific language in relation to the various aspects of the phenomenon, planning the field investigation to the greatest extent possible, dividing up the tasks in a clear way, compiling the questionnaires, and above all, individuating working hypotheses that were acceptable to all in a fundamental unity of method and perspective. Bearing in mind the diverse professional specializations of the team members and the distance dividing scholars of humanistic disciplines and scholars of naturalistic disciplines (a particularly appreciable distance in Italy, for well-known historical reasons), it becomes clear how this effort toward methodological unification took on particular importance for the results of the fieldwork. Indeed, every interdisciplinary collaboration between humanists and naturalists is destined to failure if the complementary use of respective skills is not explicitly preceded by the choice of a dominant perspective, and if a minimum of conscious agreement on this point has not been reached by all of the members of the team.

Undoubtedly such agreement matured above all in the course of the fieldwork, when the agreed instruments of analysis began to function and were tested with the response of reality. But the seed was already sown back at our center in a series of meetings which constituted a singular experience for all, rich with precious teachings. The concrete religious-historical problem to be confronted put into focus the difficulties deriving from the long disuse of dialogue between humanists and naturalists, difficulties which—as already stated—were rendered particularly acute by the recent cultural history of our country, where positivism was more narrow-minded than elsewhere, and where idealism contributed so energetically to relegating medicine, psychology and sociology to the enclosed garden of pseudoconcepts. From the diverse participants in those meetings, there was a re-emergence of the various corporative closures and opposed dogmatisms resulting from dialogues which were long suspended or had never begun. Nonetheless, under the pressure of the unifying, chosen problem in the human and historical-cultural reality of our South, a new commitment developed in all of us, a need for faithfulness and loyalty which ended up questioning the various corporative closures and opposed dogmatisms. On the wall of the room where the meetings were held, there was a large portrait of Benedetto Croce with a signed dedication to the author, and the philosopher watched us with his amiably sly and mischievous air during the discussions, where we were still speaking about him. During the preparatory period at our center, we had to solve a delicate question of courtesy toward a foreign scholar of tarantism, Prof. Wilhelm Katner of Leipzig, Assistant Director of the Karl Sudhoff-Institut für Geschichte der Medizin und Naturwissenschaften.

Prof. Katner, who in 1952 had written marginally about the musical therapy of tarantism in a monograph dedicated to the relationship between music and medicine in the Baroque age, published a specific article on the subject in 1956 in the Atti dell’Accademia Leopoldina. The author had written to colleagues at the University of Bari to find out if ethnographically observable relics of the phenomenon still existed in Apulia; unfortunately, our colleagues in Bari did not provide him with the necessary information as they should have, and for this reason his work was conducted exclusively on philological bases, as if the disappearance of the phenomenon had by then eliminated any possibility of direct observation.

To partially amend the oversight of our colleagues from Bari, it seemed appropriate to inform the German scholar of our ethnographic exploration, at the same time inviting him to join us to verify his interpretive hypotheses, even after some delay. Prof. Katner gladly accepted the invitation, promising to join us in Galatina, which in fact he did. In the meantime, the preparatory phase having reached its conclusion, the team left Rome for Galatina one June morning in 1959.

8. A cornerstone of the methodological consciousness of modern historiography is the notion that historiographic research can gain its objectivity only if it is stimulated by problems of transformation of the present reality in which the historian and his period are involved. This is not simply a matter of the thesis of the contemporaneousness of any new history, according to the formulations which Croce has made familiar in Italian cultural life. What is important is the fact that, through a meaningful convergence, cultural experiences which have matured in very different environments from that of Croce’s historicism have reached analogous formulations not only externally (which would mean little), but as voices and moments of a humanistic unity in the process of formation. Dewey’s work, from Experience and Nature to Logic, continuously reaffirms the thinking of a historiography born from the commitment to transforming the existing world and which assists such a transformation; the past remains mute until it is “chosen” in relation to a problem of the present. In Bloch's Apologie pour I'histoire, historical research is understood as the reciprocal relationship between past and present: the present is understood to the extent that it refers to the past which generated it, and the past is understood to the extent that the effort toward comprehension also includes the analysis of the present situation from which the historical investigation took its stimulus. In Febvre's Combat Pour l'histoire (1953), the current problems which involve the historian and the period in which he lives on the one hand serve as a guide to the selection of documents available, and on the other hand preside over the formation of hypotheses to test. We find analogous evidence in Marrou's De la conaissance historique (1954). Finally, the process of objectivization—carried out through the "faithfulness" of the testing of the formulated hypotheses in order to construct the past within the present in which we are engaged—assumes the form of a moment of the same faithfulness to rationally modify the present, going beyond the immediacy of those "factional passions" which represent the corporative interests of the faction itself.

The first problem the team had to resolve in the field was that of the criteria for sampling some tarantati in order to give the research a base. This problem had already been examined in our center during the preparatory seminar, but now, in the field, the criteria advanced from afar had to be adapted to the real situation in which we were operating. In consideration of the historical-cultural and religious-historical character of the hypothesis we wanted to test, we settled upon considering "tarantati" all those who, in the summer of 1959, had been involved in an event which characterized them as "tarantati" with the local people, and who participated in the ideology of the cure for the poisonous taranta bite through music, dance, and colors. In delimiting the "objects" to be sampled—"the tarantati"—we thus left out any prejudicial medical evaluation of the crisis or any a priori belittlement of the traditional "cure," accepting the popular religious consciousness' own criterion and suspending analysis for a subsequent moment. Once the objects had been determined, we decided to use the feast-day of Saints Peter and Paul (June 29) to carry out the sampling. On this occasion, the tarantati flock to the Chapel of St. Paul in the town of Galatina from various villages of the Salento, in order to thank the Saint for the recovery obtained during the home cure, to further confirm such a recovery, or to beseech him for it in the event that the home cure had not been carried out or had remained ineffective. From June 28 to June 30 — during the days of the festive celebrations in Galatina — thirty-five tarantati were identified in the chapel in this manner; of these, nineteen were chosen at random for subsequent visits in their villages in order to gain a more complete picture, at least for these tarantati. During the visits to the Salentine towns, both before and after the holiday of June 29, we were told of tarantati who were not seen in the chapel, but we deliberately avoided visiting them so as to concentrate our attention exclusively upon those for whom we had observation data regarding their behavior in the chapel. In only two instances did we depart from this rule: for the sole confirmed case of latrodectism and for a tarantato who had long been hospitalized and was particularly interesting from a psychiatric point of view. If we add these two cases to the thirty-five identified in the chapel and to the nineteen selected, we reach the figure of thirty-seven tarantati identified in the Salento in June 1959, and twenty-one tarantati as the research base. Since the visit to the chapel on the occasion of the feast-day of Saints Peter and Paul is generally mandatory for Salentine tarantati, their influx to Galatina from June 28 to June 30 was a significant indication of the dimension and diffusion of the phenomenon in the summer of 1959. However, it was only an indication, since some tarantati do not go to Galatina due to economic reasons, devotional ties to other saints (for example, St. Donatus or St. Foca), or simply because the seasonal crisis occurred in a period which was distant from the feast-day of Saints Peter and Paul; therefore, these tarantati were not observable in the chapel. In any case, from the thirty-seven tarantati identified and from occasional information gathered during our visits to Salentine villages, we may state that in the season of 1959, the tarantati of the Salento did not altogether number many more than one hundred. This figure includes those who in the 1959 season had suffered from the “first bite” as well as those — the vast majority, given the meager number of “new recruits” — who were subject to the seasonal repetition of the alleged “poisoning” according to a pattern which, as we will see, makes up one of the salient characteristics of tarantism as a historical-cultural phenomenon. Tarantism solicits the participation in diverse capacities of musicians, family members and an assorted audience of “believers” who throng at the doors of the hovels* where the home cures take place, or who form a circle around the dancing tarantato. Bearing this in mind, it seems reasonable to conclude — based on the data gathered in June and July 1959 — that tarantism in the Salento today directly influences the ideology and behavior of several thousand people, while the population’s attitude toward the phenomenon is variously nuanced according to social class, level of education, and everything else that conditions the cultural experience of individual people. The ethnographic fieldwork of the summer of 1959, with its motivations and cultural premises, imposed its own methodological norms. The first task was to evaluate the opposing hypothesis: the medical interpretation of tarantism as a disease. If this hypothesis were shown to be true, our whole investigation would have to be considered a failure. The team's doctor was entrusted with the task of establishing how the phenomenon of tarantism fared among those who dealt with it in the dual medical perspective of its reduction to latrodectism or to some particular state of psychic abnormality.

In the various hospitals and with long-experienced municipal doctors, the investigation led to a substantially negative outcome. Latrodectism in the Salento is rare, and even in the cases traced to an episode of latrodectism, the initial toxic syndrome fitted onto the framework of tarantism. The doctor recognized that tarantism defied a logical definition within the framework of modern psychiatry.

The doctor's negation was confirmed by a cultural analysis, which identified a set of indications testifying in favor of the symbolic character and historical-cultural conditioning of tarantism. The team arrived "in the field" and discovered that Galatina enjoyed the privilege of being "immune" to tarantism due to the protection St. Paul bestowed upon it and its "fiefdom." It would have been futile to look for tarantati in Galatina and the surrounding countryside included in the "fiefdom." The word "fiefdom" calls to mind ancient social relations, long gone today; however, in local linguistic usage, the expression "fiefdom of Galatina" was used to indicate a sacred delimitation—an area in which the tarantula did not cause harm by concession of the Apostle to the Gentiles, who in Malta had dominated an echidna, a poisonous viper, that had freed itself from a bundle of sticks the Saint had thrown to stoke a fire. At one time, there must have been other areas of immunity in the Salento and throughout Apulia, under the protection of one saint or another.

On the harsh, ravaged Adriatic coast of the Salentine Peninsula lies the small town of San Foca, where visitors to the church still receive discolored images of this Byzantine saint with the following caption: "St. Foca protects his devotees in a special way from the bites of insects and poisonous reptiles, such as tarantulas, vipers, etc." In the past, the question of oases of immunity was complicated by disputes between the various religious orders and by the privileges each boasted with respect to the others.

The naturalist Paolo Boccone, a Cistercian monk who lived in the 1700s, informs us in his Museo di Fisica that in Brindisi and the Land of Otranto, no brother of the Observants of St. Francis was ever afflicted by the saranta, while the same could not be said of the Capuchins, whom the little creature sometimes harmed; however, if the tarantato Capuchin father was covered with the habit of an Observant, he was immediately cured with no need for music and dance.

Indeed, in the land of Brindisi, again in the 1700s, there was a monastery of the Observants, where in a cell built in St. Francis's day, the tarantula never made their nests, thanks to the privilege of the Poor Man of Assisi, less compassionate toward the tarantula of Apulia than he was toward the wolf of Agobbio. We do not know if real immunities corresponded to these claims of a more or less recent past, but as for Galatina and its fiefdom, the area actually did turn out to be immune in the heart of a region where tarantism was still relatively widespread.

In fact, there were no tarantati in Galatina, nor, according to the people's recollections, had there ever been in the past. During the feast-day of June 29, the tarantati who flocked to the city were all from other Salentine towns. Upon entering the fiefdom, they underwent a decisive experience for their crises, as if they had entered a sacred territory, a larger "templum" whose center was the chapel of Galatina. This indication, which immediately attracted our attention, already offered evidence in favor of the cultural conditioning of tarantism.

With the hypothesis that the phenomenon was to be reduced entirely to the real bite of a poisonous arachnid, it became a mystery as to why this arachnid's toxicity was suspended only in Galatina, and why it operated just beyond the boundaries of the fiefdom, hardly a few kilometers away in towns like Cutrofiano, Galatone or Nardé, ruling out the possibility that changes in the diffusion of the fauna or a different frequency of man-spider encounters could in some way explain things. Instead, everything occurred as if a typically cultural shaping had come into play in tarantism's manifestation: the belief in an area of immunity dependent on St. Paul's protection and in the efficacy of a well containing miraculous water at the chapel of Galatina. Very soon, this first indication was added to others which oriented the research in the same direction. One of the fundamental characteristics of tarantism, unanimously attested to by various authors from the 1600s on, was the possible and indeed very frequent repetition of the crises and cure each year for a variable number of years. There was a first bite treated at home through the use of music, dance, and colors, but each year the crisis and treatment tended to be renewed, producing a regular, periodic series of “re-bites” and “un-poisonings.”® Moreover, the annual cure was followed by a visit to the chapel of Galatina, or —due to the evident disintegration of the phenomenon — the traditional cure was not practiced and the visit to the chapel remained. Of the twenty-one farantati who were the object of particular examination, only two were on their “first bite,” while many of the others had been tarantati for years, even decades (for example, forty-four, fifty-three, sixty years — cf. Table A). Now, this protracted repetition of the crisis and the relative cure could not have any reasonable relation to a toxic syndrome resulting from the bite of a poisonous arachnid; in particular, latrodectism — the toxic syndrome from the bite of Latrodectus tredecimguttatus — was absolutely incompatible with the reproduction of the crisis over a period of decades. This repetition, so characteristic of tarantism, instead suggested a cultural conditioning, the respect of a tradition, the seasonal repetition of a rite, the calendrical celebration of a ceremony. Indeed, the tarantism observed in the course of our fieldwork not only was characterized by a generic elective period in the hot months, which could still have fit in with ® The book’s Italian title, La Terra del Rimorso, may be alternatively translated as “The Land of Re-bite,” a play on words in the Italian which alludes to the “re-bites” or relapses to which the tarantati are prey.

Now, an assessment of this sort was undou| s : compatible with the plasticity of a cultural phenomenon, but not with any kin i me of arachnidism. : ons warding the differential participation of the two sexes in the phenomenon were oriented in the same interpretive direction. Out of rey seven farantati identified in the chapel in June 1959, thirty-two were females, delineating a prevalence which was too clear-cut to be casual. This fact ~ =) more significant, since the historical documentation from the seventeenth cen aT on confirmed the prevalence of female participation in tarantism, althoug e the past it was perhaps not so marked as today. In the works of Bruni, “es oO and De Raho, there are indeed sufficient indications to remove the question “_ merely impressionistic evaluations and establish the indicative a, . such participation at the beginning of the 1600s, in the first half of the S, and in the first decade of the 1900s. At the end of the seventeenth century, von Baglivi was struck by the predominant female participation in tarantism, which contrasted with the thesis of tarantism as a result of an actual bite of the Apulian tarantula. He devised the solution of two tarantisms: one authentic, deriving from the poisonous spider bite, and the other spurious, "little carnivals of women."

The tradition of tarantism as a predominantly female phenomenon must have already been common at the end of the 1400s, as shown by Pontano's dialogue Antonius, published for the first time in 1491. In it, Compadre says that in Apulia, women were in the habit of being bitten "quam saepissime" [as often as possible] by the taranta, and with this excuse, they were permitted "libere atque — viros petere" [to ask for men freely and with impunity].

However, the results obtained from the ethnographic exploration of 1959, along with the corresponding historical confirmations, show a discrepancy when compared with the data from Bettini (1954) regarding the distribution of latrodectism in Italy during the period 1949-54. Of the 231 cases considered by Bettini, 181 were males, and 50 were females, indicating that the frequency for males is higher than the corresponding frequency for females in almost every age group.

In Pampiglione's monograph on Cerveteri from 1936 to 1952, there were thirty-four males out of forty-three cases. This data is in full agreement with the greater use of male laborers in agricultural work and their exposure to the danger of being bitten by Latrodectus.

The clear-cut prevalence of female participation in tarantism did not fit in with the existing relation of employment of the two sexes in agricultural labor in the Salento. According to the census of 1951, in the province of Lecce, out of a resident population of 603,000 persons and a working population of 302,105, agricultural workers amount to 173,000 persons, of whom 58,912 are women.

The local diffusion of the cultivation and primary processing of tobacco, with its use of predominantly female labor (there are 60,000 women working in tobacco), does not significantly alter the fact that men participate to a greater degree than women in agricultural labor, while women participate in tarantism in an overwhelming majority.

Tarantism's antecedents date back to the Medieval period and even to the ancient world, whereas tobacco cultivation, present in the Land of Otranto from the time of Galanti's report (1791), became more widespread in the Salento only after the laws which overturned feudalism and mortmain, when the agrarian bourgeoisie which was in part coming to substitute the nobility found a qualitative compensation in tobacco-growing for the quantitative loss of land.

Moreover, it must be observed that tarantism, today restricted only to the Salento, was once widespread with substantially identical forms in all of Apulia and in other provinces of the Kingdom of Naples, in areas where tobacco-growing was not practiced.° Finally, of the twenty-one cases examined during the fieldwork of 1959, none presented the episode of the "first bite" in connection with the tobacco harvest, and only the mother of a tarantata, herself a tarantata in the past but no longer one at the time, reported having suffered from the "first bite" in these circumstances. In short, the relation of the employment of the two sexes in agricultural work does not justify the prevalence of female participation in tarantism, which thus defers to other conditionings of a social-historical and religious-historical nature. During the investigation, two other indications emerged which argued against reductively attributing tarantism to latrodectism and more generally to any other form of arachnidism. The first indication referred to the fact that tarantism featured not only a distribution according to place (local immunities), time (seasonal and calendrical preferences) and sex (an overwhelming female prevalence), but also a familial distribution. The tarantati studied numbered twenty-one, but they belonged to seventeen families, and in three of these families there had been tarantati among ascendant or collateral kin in the past who were no longer tarantati at the time.

The other indication concerned the age of the "first bite." If we observe tarantism during one of its annual crises and indiscriminately evaluate all those who, in the given season, appear as active tarantati, we will not perceive any particular preference of the phenomenon for one age or another in life. But if the data relative to the age of the "first bite" are collected systematically, an indication takes shape in favor of the hypothesis that the "first bite" falls with greater frequency between the beginning of puberty and the end of the period of development (see Table A).

Obviously, the tarantati who were taken as "samples" formed too limited a base to verify such a hypothesis statistically, but the qualitative analysis of the individual cases made it highly probable. Qualitative assessments of this sort were not lacking in the past in the literature on tarantism. Epifanio noted that tarantism could involve anyone but more so during adolescent years. In his Osservazioni sul tarantismo di Puglia, read in the Accademia Medico-Chirugica of Naples, De Renzi mentioned the prevalence of tarantism in youth, in connection with the excitement of ane and "violent passions which belong to this age." The Apulian Giuseppe Chiaia somewhat maliciously noted how "the first vague restlessness of our pubescent youth, which elsewhere a prudent confessor would avert or mitigate with the abstinences of the Marian month or the one which follows, here in Apulia - sometimes resolved with guitar and tambourine."

Local immunity, seasonal and calendrical repetition, an overwhelming prevalence of female participation, familial distribution, and the preference of the first bite for the age of the beginning of puberty and the end of development: all of these elements oriented the research toward a symbolic interpretation, an interpretation in which taranta, "bite," "poison," "crisis," "cure" and "recovery" acquired the meaning of mythical-ritual symbols, culturally conditioned in their functioning.

The separation of tarantism from latrodectism received further confirmation during the fieldwork. As stated, out of the twenty-one cases considered, one case involved a peasant of the Arneo who was stung by a Latrodectus one July night while sleeping near a threshing machine. Within the real toxic syndrome, this man inserted a series of behaviors modeled after the cultural tradition of tarantism, annually reviving the event of his bite, poisoning, and "cure" through music and colors. However, if for the nineteen cases in which the initial episode dated back to a more or less remote past (up to sixty years earlier!), we were dealing with latrodectism, we could not rule out the possibility that, for at least some of these cases, the initial episode—the "first bite"—had really involved the sting of a Latrodectus. This hypothesis was all the more likely inasmuch as the case of the Arneo peasant demonstrated that at least once, this had been precisely so. The memories of the farantati and their families—to the extent that they were to be trusted—sometimes referred to symbolic situations.

In Italian, the verbs "bite" (mordere) and "sting" (pungere, pizzicare) in this context are used interchangeably, although the two modalities of poisoning appear to be different. The two terms have been maintained in the English translation to reflect the importance of the connection among bite, re-bite, and remorse, and the Latin root pungere, which takes on great significance in De Martino's historical analysis. Moreover, as will become apparent below, in the ideology of tarantism, there are other means of "first bite" which have nothing to do with literal biting, such as being "sfiatato [hissed at] by a snake.

In some cases, the references to the "first bite" hinted at situations that spoke in favor of a possible "real first bite," such as declarations like "stung while pruning the grape vines," "stung during the tobacco harvest," "stung in the countryside," etc. Moreover, the preferred season for tarantism, from May to August, coincided with an intense period of agricultural work, especially with mowing, gleaning, and threshing, which increased the visibility and aggressiveness of arachnids in general. Finally, just as the cultural molding of tarantism was grafted onto the sole confirmed case of latrodectism, so, too, in the cases in which latrodectism was definitely not a factor, the crisis of tarantism more or less roughly imitated the toxic syndrome of latrodectism, as if the cultural model of someone who "acts" poisoned had been copied as much as possible from real latrodectism.

The symptoms of the crisis of tarantism, such as falling to the ground, a feeling of prostration, anguish, a state of psychomotor agitation with a beclouding of the sensory apparatus, difficulty in remaining standing, stomach ache, nausea and vomiting, various paresthesias and muscular pains, and a heightening of sexual desire, appeared in the moment of the crisis of tarantism even in cases where other symptoms could lead to the certain exclusion of acute latrodectism, resulting in an image of the poisoned victim that could easily deceive someone who was not a doctor.

From the cultural analysis, therefore, two apparently conflicting results emerged. On the one hand, there was the symbolic autonomy of tarantism and its irreducibility to latrodectism as evidenced by local immunities, the seasonal and calendrical repetitions, the overwhelming prevalence of female participation, a certain familial distribution of the tarantati, and the elective age of the first bite. On the other hand, the relation of tarantism to latrodectism was not incidental, as evidenced by the sole certified case in which tarantism had really begun with an episode of latrodectism, the probable indications to the same effect in the narratives of the tarantati and their families regarding the circumstances of the first bite, the coincidence of the preferred season of tarantism with a period of the agricultural year in which the danger of actually being bitten was greater, and finally, the rather rough imitation of the toxic syndrome of the Latrodectus bite by those tarantati who certainly did not display acute latrodectism. The apparent conflict between these two orders of indications could not be resolved by sacrificing one of the two; indeed, both arose from exact observations and would have to be regarded as certainties. Thus, it was a matter of defining an interpretation which embraced and justified both in a coherent, unitary framework — which, again, could be done only through an appeal to a historical-cultural and religious-historical perspective.

Tarantism as a definite mythical-cultural horizon — as the bite of the poisonous taranta during the harvest season of summer’s fruits, returning each year to act as bite and poison, to be exorcised each year with music, dance and colors — was not "reducible" to latrodectism, but neither was it "independent" of it, inasmuch as latrodectism had to be considered an important historical and existential condition for the genesis of tarantism. In the course of a certain cultural and religious history, the symbolism of the taranta had rendered itself autonomous from real episodes of latrodectism which were associated with summer agricultural tasks (perhaps at one time more frequent than today). Such an autonomy took on two fundamental aspects: either the admission of latrodectism simply became the opportunity for evoking and exorcising other forms of "symbolic poisoning" in order to release and resolve traumas, frustrations, and unresolved conflicts of each individual; or, at a higher level of symbolic expression, "the crisis of the poisoned victim" arose using the model of latrodectism, symbolically remodeled as the bite of the taranta which unleashes a crisis to be ritually controlled through the exorcism of music, dance, and colors.

This unitary interpretation agreed with the results of the ethnographic report and with the cultural analysis without sacrificing either. It explained why the possible latrodectism of the tarantati (as in the case of the "first bite") was complicated by characteristics which clearly went beyond the bounds of the clinical description of latrodectism, and why the tarantati who were "currently afflicted with latrodectism" still imitated, more or less, the toxic syndrome. Likewise, it explained why the "first bite" was described with particular emphasis not only in situations connected with agricultural activities (in which a real bite was not to be ruled out), but also in situations which may be called symbolic, as for example "stung by the window at noon," "stung after her father's death," "stung after dreaming of snakes [scarzont)," "stung while in prayer," "enchanted by a snake on the way to the sea, before having seen a snake killed" (cf. Table A). The following text is a corrected version of the OCRed text provided:

Such symbolic situations undouma belonged to a subjective reconstruction of the facts by the -- or family, and thus they also did not have per se any demonstrative force for ruling out an initial episode of latrodectism. But precisely their subjective reconstruction" of the facts introduced particular determinations into the phenomenon and modeled behaviors, connecting itself to cultural realities and releasing symbolic efficacies. The unitary interpretation also explained why, in the medical literature on tarantism from the seventeenth century to today, there were descriptions of cases which suggested latrodectism, while other cases seemed to involve an altogether different disease, or simply "little carnivals of women" [De Matens uses the term coreutico, from the Italian noun coreutica - the art of dance. The English adjective choreutic derives from the same Greek root.]; and how it had been possible, with regard to the same phenomenon, for the medical "reduction" to oscillate between arachnidism, sunstroke and some psychic disorder, with grounds from one case to the next for each of these "reductions." Finally, there was not an explanation for the phenomenon's characteristic cultural plasticity, which our investigation had so clearly evidenced and which was destined to elude every attempt at a "naturalistic reduction" of tarantism to a somatic or psychic disease.

The historical-cultural interpretation in turn suggested an important methodological principle to be observed in the course of the ethnographic investigation of tarantism: that is, in all first bite situations, which by their nature rendered the objective reality of an arachnid's bite credible (agricultural work, etc.), two possibilities had to be borne in mind ~ that of an initial episode of latrodectism upon which the mythical-ritual symbolism of tarantism was subsequently grafted, and (much more frequent overall) that of an entirely symbolic bite, experienced in situations (agricultural work, etc.) in which the encounter with poisonous arachnids belonged to the order of traditional memories of the regime of peasant existence.

As the field investigation progressed, the cultural perspective in the interpretation of tarantism emerged as the most pertinent of all for the study of the phenomenon; even so, another hypothesis as to the origins of the phenomenon was also taken to the exact limits of its validity. This was the thesis recently advanced by Prof. Katner of Leipzig, in a monograph which was unfortunately elaborated without the aid of direct observation of the phenomenon. As we have already mentioned, the silence of our colleagues at the University of Bari led Prof. Katner to believe that the phenomenon was no longer observable in Apulia, and that therefore one could now only discuss it by referring to old historical descriptions and modern medical knowledge. From a comparison of the data gathered by Epifanio Ferdinando and Baglivi with those resulting from clinical observations of heatstroke and sunstroke ~ particularly in the works of FA. Steinhausen (1910) and B.G. Maegraith (1952) — Prof. Katner thought it possible to conclude that the historical origins of tarantism were not in latrodectism, but instead in heatstroke or sunstroke. Without entering into the merits of a differential diagnosis conducted at such a distance in time and place and on the basis of seventeenth-century doctors' reports, it was the duty of our team — through the contribution of its doctor, who was prepared to deal with the question — to orient the fieldwork in such a way as to test the validity of this hypothesis. Leaving aside the opinion of local doctors regarding the rarity of sunstroke in the region and the mild form it generally assumes, perhaps due to the windy climate, we found that out of the twenty-one tarantati examined, scarcely two cases were probably connected to an initial episode of sunstroke. This is a similar proportion to that of the other morbid connections noted. At any rate, these connections were clearly casual with regard to tarantism, which introduced autonomous determinants of a strictly cultural character.

Nonetheless, Katner's hypothesis highlighted an element which could have played an important part on the historical-cultural level. A certain analogy actually exists between the toxic syndrome of latrodectism and sunstroke; though the differential diagnosis is relatively easy, the two symptomatologies could be confused in an "an ° a’ ie ‘torical-cultural and religious-historical perspective emerging from the clinical-historical work. The possibility that not only the toxic syndrome of latrodectism, but also sunstroke, could have contributed to forming the culturally-based image of tarantism, with its specific autonomy with respect to latrodectism or any other morbid state as such.

In other words, the model of the eso fined victim—with its multiple symbolic meanings and its mythic ae form of the taranta—could have historically imitated real episodes of latrodectism but also of sunstroke, fused together and remolded at the cultural elaboration. The period of the harvest, with its decisive environmental meaning for the grain-growing community and with the sa tensions to which individuals and social groups were subject, was a time of dangerous encounters with poisonous animals hidden in the wheat fields, on the vines, in vegetable gardens. But it was also the period of lengthy exposure to the fierce heat of the Mediterranean summer and of sudden sunstrokes, which upset the order of the harsh fatigue, taking away consciousness and sense.

The "darts" of the sun's rays, no less than the "bite of the poisoning animal, constituted a recurrent experience connected with that critical moment in peasant existence which is the epilogue to the agricultural year, the a of summer fruits. On this historically-defined existential terrain, the symbol of the biting taranta germinated in a form in which one who acted as the victim in a symbolic sense imitated the behavior of someone who, stung by the spider or by the sun's arrows, appeared to be in extreme danger.

In light of these results from the cultural analysis, it became clear that we could not embrace the other interpretation of tarantism attempted by the doctors—its reduction to a psychic illness. In this regard, there was an old tradition in the literature on the topic. As far back as the 1600s, Epifanio Ferdinando, who was the first to systematically develop the thesis of tarantism as a real toxic state deriving from a spider's bite (in the specific case, from the bite of the Apulian tarantula), recalled how in his time there were some "so—as to deny this disease, which in their opinion was traceable to a—disease, a melancholy or a form of dementia." Subsequently, Tommaso Corne, whose name is so closely linked to the revival of Neapolitan cultural life in the second half of the seventeenth century, expressed the opinion that all of the tarantati were "lacking salt," and that "for some particular indisposition [they] fall into a melancholy delirium, convinced—according to the popular a—that they have been bitten by the taranta. "Since then, the interpretation of tarantism, which we would call psychopathological, has had variable scope up to Giordano’s recent monograph on tarantism as a collective psychosis. In the past, it was recognized that tarantism featured a typically cultural – and not a definite order of mythical-cultural symbols belonging to a certain tradition. Every attempt at a psychopathological reduction of the phenomenon was rejected as inadequate. In the perspective of the cultural analysis, tarantism did not manifest itself as a psychic disorder, but as a culturally conserved symbolic order (the exorcism of music, dance, and colors), in which a well-defined crisis – again, culturally modeled – found its solution.

The neurotic crisis could appear connected to a real episode of latrodectism or to another organic illness, but what made up tarantism was the autonomy of its symbol, which gave a horizon to unresolved and latent psychic conflicts in the unconscious. Much more often the crisis sought out an opportunity, so to speak, by taking advantage of a 'possible bite' situation (the harvest of summer fruits, sleeping in the fields, etc.), or perhaps it did not even preserve this semblance of credibility, so pressing was the need to unleash itself.

The apparatus of evocation and release – that is, the exorcism in action – could perhaps not function, but the apparatus as such was not a 'disease.' Rather, it was an instrument of reintegration, a traditionalized order of possible symbolic efficacies which disciplined the crisis, assigning it certain places, times, and modes, and straining to bring it towards a new equilibrium.

The individual tarantati could occasionally be considered ill, but tarantism sought to introduce its own modeling, its own culturally-functioning rule into the disease and into the way of reacting to it, a rule of the normal and the abnormal, the harmful and the efficacious, conflict and resolution.

During our fieldwork, only once did tarantism appear to recede to the level of a true psychic alteration, having lost any appreciable significance as cultural reintegration: when we saw it in the Chapel of St. Paul during the celebration of June 29. However, what the team observed in that circumstance was not tarantism, but its disintegration through the work of the Catholic influence. In the chapel, its typical symbolic apparatus – the exorcism of music, dance, and colors – could not function, and what remained was a crisis scarcely modeled on the 'behavior of the poisoned victim' without the ritual order which still operated in the home exorcism. Thus the manifestations in the chapel confirmed the non-reducibility of tarantism to psychic illness, precisely because they gave us a glimpse of it heading towards forms of psychic disorder only when, through an outside cultural influence, the order of its mythical-ritual symbolism could not come into play.

The symbolic autonomy of tarantism manifests itself most clearly when we compare the myth of the taranta with spiders of modern zoology, ca Armed with chelicerae of considerable size, everything in its rr. reinforces the image of the power to bite; on the other hand, the muc fearsome but smaller and less conspicuous Latrodectus dy ibeltpentera not provoke equally intense emotional reactions. Other preferential _ ae titles for Lycosa come from its habits. This spider normally lives in the fie! 2 where it constructs an underground burrow, lying hidden during the day an coming out of hiding only rarely and for brief periods; in the night, ceed it leaves its lair and roams in search of food. The Lycosa reaches its victim wi a rapid run, jumping up to two palms; it makes this jump by lifting itself on its hind legs, its large chelicerae fanning out and ready to close in a bite, ina posture of vibrant aggressiveness. In the winter, the spider closes the opening to its lair and lives hidden inside; with the coming of the hot season, it molts its exoskeleton several times, mates and deposits eggs in a cocoon, from which the offspring emerge in the middle or end of summer.

The appearance of Lycosa, then, suggests a series of images, which are particularly suitable for Providing a horizon‘ for the obscure drives of the unconscious, to the a, of a ciphered past which returns in the alienation of neurotic symptoms, for t : inner bite which induces a search for “things that bite,” for the dream of tota’ Tenewal, eroticism and fertility — in conjunction, moreover, with the season for harvesting what has been sown and for paying debts incurred on the economic and existential levels. The conspicuous appearance of Lycosa, its disturbing mobility, its aggressiveness and ferocity, and the coincidence between the harvest period and the season of renewal and fertile mating — these features all contribute to forming elective titles for refashioning this zoological species into a multifaceted symbol capable of giving a horizon to numerous “temptations” of the unconscious and their corresponding conscious reactions. In short, the symbolic refashioning of Lycosa more or less recalls that of the mantide religiosa in R. Caillois’ interpretation.'” As for Latrodectus, in this regard it does not possess the same titles as Lycosa. Indeed, it is not a very striking spider: its movements are slow, it weaves an irregular but very sticky web at the base of underbrush and grass, where it waits for insects to get trapped; it does not roam in search of food; it does not pursue its victim, but instead waits patiently for it in the middle of the web; it bites man above all when inadvertently squeezed by a hand or by the weight of a body (for example, handling the harvest or sleeping in the fields); finally, the bite of Latrodectus may pass momentarily unnoticed and may not even be attributed to the spider by its victim. It is necessary, however, to add immediately that if the spider which modern zoology calls Lycosa tarentula enters into the symbolic weft of the taranta myth in a preferred way, this preference is only relative; other poisonous spiders, such as Latrodectus or the scorpion, or even a harmless spider like epeira could have contributed to the formation of that mythical mostrum which is the taranta of tarantism. Back in the eighteenth century, a doctor from Lecce named Nicola Caputo noted that all phalanxes were called tarantole in Apulia. 

And in fact, even today in the Salento one obtains responses in this regard which do not conform to the classifications of modern zoology. This, however, should not lead us to think of the taranta as a “confused notion” produced by bad observations and a scant respect for the rules of coherence. Rather, the taranta obeys the symbolic coherence of the myth, and the “confused notion” arises only in our minds as “learned” persons when we insist on measuring the symbolic coherence of the taranta by using the unsuitable unit of measure of naturalistic coherence. The unifying principle of the taranta myth is the symbolic horizon of the spider which bites and ensnares with its bite; with regard to this principle, the differences between Lycosa, Latrodectus, the scorpion and epeira are not as important as they are for someone who employs the criteria of zoological, toxicological or medical research. In the perspective of the myth’s symbolic coherence, Lycosa possesses some preferential titles for becoming symbolically refashioned, but other spiders can also lend their images wholly or in part for the construction of the mythical mostrum of the taranta without a contradiction being noticed in the least, precisely because the type of coherence which would make it noticeable does not come into play here. Other spiders, too, can be connected to the experience of an insidious, more or less poisonous bite, and can possibly be indicated as tarante: for example, Baglivi informs us that the scorpion entered into the framework of tarantism, and Boccone even coined the denomination of “scorpionati” to be placed alongside the traditional and popular one of “tarantati”(or attarantati).

Analogously, despite being so conspicuous, the Latrodectus loaned its own select images to the myth of il 1a, images which are foreign to the behavior and habits of Lycosa but satisfy particular symbolic needs. For example, the image of the spider swinging in the air and letting itself be carried by the wind, are foreign to the behavior and habits of Latrodectus, but they figure into the symbolic weft of tarantism, beautifully borrowed from the behavior and habits of Latrodectus. During our fieldwork, we were able to affirm how the initial episode which annoyed tarantism was at times not even ascribed to a spider. For example, we found that the person had been “sfiatato by a snake (see Table A). The person who was “sfiatato by a snake behaved like a tarantato; he was considered as such by people and was treated with the musical exorcism without any contradiction being noticed. The economy of the mythical symbol of the taranta with regard to naturalistic observation is also manifested in the symbolism of poison and effects. From the point of view of toxicology and modern medicine, the Lycosa provokes in man a local reaction which is sometimes moderate: hyperemia, localized necrosis), but general effects which are scant and light. In contrast, the local effects of the bite of Latrodectus are modest, but the systemic ones are very serious. The mythical-ritual symbol of the taranta is interestingly oriented toward the spider which gives more imposing local effects, the Lycosa, but at the same time, as we stated above, it models the crisis as an imitation of the more serious toxic state — the one inflicted by the bite of Latrodectus. The symbol of the taranta does not exhaust its function only through configuring; it also resolves and releases what is configured. Here we see the grafting of what we may call the actual ritual "plan" of tarantism. Such a plan is feasible on the condition that the taranta is a "dancer"; the "sleeper" taranta marks a limit to the efficacy of the symbol in action, the possibility that it might not operate. Indeed, to make the taranta "croak" or "drop dead," it is above all necessary to mimic the dance of the little spider — the tarantella. Following an irresistible identification, it is necessary to dance with the spider, indeed be the dancing spider; but at the same time it is necessary to make an actual agonistic moment be felt — the superimposition and imposition of one's own choreutic rhythm upon that of the spider, forcing the spider to dance until it is tired, pursuing it as it flees the chasing foot, or squashing it and stamping it as the foot violently beats the floor to the rhythm of the tarantella. The tarantato executes the dance of the little taranta (the tarantella) as a victim possessed by the beast and as the hero who subdues the beast by dancing; this is carried out through the tension between "identification" and "agonistic detachment," "letting go" and "regaining oneself," and "making oneself a spider" and "dancing the spider." During the agonistic identification of the choreutic-musical exorcism, the combatant sometimes dialogues aloud with the spider, submitting to its orders or managing to impose his own command: he comes to terms with it and has it set the length of the choreutic performances or the time of the next crisis. This is, in essence, the symbol of the saranta as a mythical-ritual horizon of evocation, configuration, release and resolution of the unresolved psychic conflicts which "re-bite" in the obscurity of the unconscious. As a cultural model, this symbol offers a mythical-ritual order for settling these conflicts and reintegrating individuals into the group.

The symbol of the taranta lends a figure* to the formless, rhythm and melody to menacing silence, and color to the colorless in an assiduous quest of articulated and distinct passions, where a horizonless excitation alternates with a depression that isolates and closes off. This symbol offers a perspective for imagining, hearing and watching what we lack imagination for and are deaf and blind to, and which nevertheless peremptorily asks to be imagined, heard and seen. In such a perspective, nothing is more pertinent than a spider that bites and poisons with its bite and the project of courageously becoming the poisonous spider, while at the same time fighting to free oneself from it. And in the same perspective, nothing is more d

Besides indicating figura as in "form," De Martino plays on the word to mean a musical and dance "figure."

Even the symbolic theme of the bite that returns in subsequent ritual seasons acquires the meaning of a cultural order called to discipline a "return which might otherwise explode at any moment in time, taking on all of the antisocial traits of an individual crisis lacking a horizon.

The mythical-ritual symbolism of tarantism operates a cultural molding in people, and it creates a profound modeling not only in the orientation of thought and sentiment but also in the psychosomatic framework itself. This molding and modeling are most clearly seen in the particular use of a common Salentine dialect word in relation to tarantism: the verb scazzicare. Drawing from Rohlfs dictionary, this verb has a varied semantic use in the Salento: it indicates an action of lifting or removing a material weight or compact mass (for example, moving a straw mattress), and in the psychic and psychosomatic framework, it denotes an abnormal and irresistible stimulation of sentiments and bodily needs, their indomitable pricking and unleashing. Thus, for example, infants scazzicano when they cry desperately; hunger, which appears suddenly and without restraint, scazzica; and someone compellingly taken by emotion, it is said to scazzicare. Among the passions that can scazzicarsi, the venereal appetite takes on particular emphasis, and one of the verb's most common meanings concerns the erotic impulse's uncontrolled bursting out against every discipline of civility and custom. However, Rohlfs does not mention the particular use of the word in the sphere of tarantism, where it above all denotes the psychomotor excitation which—together with and in opposition to a total inertia—makes up the behavior of the tarantato.

Secondly, scazzicare denotes the specific stimulation that comes from music and colors, inasmuch as they are symbols of an exorcism that evokes latent urgings in the state of total inertia; rather than release these urges in an incoherent psychomotor excitation, this stimulation releases them in a ceremonial order dominated by dance figures and the other symbolic themes of tarantism in action. For this reason, the traditional plan of behaviors included in tarantism foresees a band that is placed next to the inert tarantato and begins a musical exploration to define the "right" music—the music of the taranta involved in that particular case. The "right" music will move the tarantato to scazzicare, but do so according to the ways of the ritual, abandoning the state of inertia and bending the psychomotor agitation to the rhythm of the music and the figures of the dance. At the same time, an attempt is made to provide the tarantato with the "right" colors in the form of colored ribbons—that is, the Colors of the taranta that bit him. The right colors will be the ones that cause the tarantato to scazzicare in an alternation of repulsions and attractions, of aggressive outbursts and idolizations, but once again, in the framework of a defined ceremonial order, disciplined by an exorcism in action.

The connection between this word and tarantism probably explains why, in one of the meanings noted by Rohlfs, it also denotes a difficulty in standing up (mi scazzicu = I stand up with difficulty); this appears to symbolize the state of inertia, prostration, and weariness that, together with the disorderly motor release, makes up the "crisis" moment of tarantism.

But let us now turn to individual persons in order to concretely analyze the functioning symbol. When the team reached Galatina on June 20, 1959, our first concern was that of obtaining the opportunity to attend one of the home exorcisms that, as noted, became more numerous in the Salentine towns with the coming of the feast-day of June 29. But this was not an easy task, since we lacked a network of informants in the province who could notify us in time when individual cases unpredictably took place, these being few in each season and scattered over a relatively wide area.

We confided our concerns to the manager of the Cavallino Bianco, who told us that once—before opening his sunny, precarious little hotel—he had "played" for tarantati, and that in Nardo he knew two brothers who were still actively employed as musicians. And so, in the late afternoon of the 24th, we left with him for Nardo in search of the two brothers, who had a barbershop in the center of the town, readapting the old tradition of the barber-phlebotomist to local therapeutic needs. The two brothers were not in the shop, but the shop-boy told us that the older one was at that very moment playing for a tarantata in a nearby alley. And indeed, lending an ear, we could hear the echo of a rustic concertino dominated by the pressing rhythm of the tambourine. With the shop-boy's summary indications and, understandably, a certain suspense, the team got moving on the trail of the rhythm. And there, about a hundred meters into the forest of alleyways, the concertino became increasingly distinct. The rhythm of the tambourine revealed the melodic line of the "dance of the little spider" — the tarantella; it was the ancient tarantella of the South in its original therapeutic function, just as it was heard by Epifanio Ferdinando, Baglivi, Fathers Nicolello and Galliberto, Valletta, Caputo and all of the others who from the 1600s until today had, with various thoughts on the matter, directed their "pity" toward the singular human document of tarantism.

Discerning a crowd of persons outside of a hovel, we immediately located the house from which the sounds emerged. We quickened our step and were in front of the door; we made our way through the crowd, bestowing a plain smile upon the many eyes in the process of asking, "Who are these strangers?" And finally, out of the blue, from day to night, we found ourselves brutally hurled onto another planet.

The room, the only one in the miserable dwelling, received light from the door and from a little window, so small and high that everything would have been wrapped in semi-darkness if two candles had not given the interior an unstable glimmer. Against the wall facing the entrance lay a disheveled bed, leaning down to the floor as if to help someone slide to the ground were he unable or unwilling to get up with his own force. Above this strange alcove, some sacred images in a frame of paper flowers formed a rustic little altar on the wall. On the night table next to the bed, there were pictures of St. Peter and a carafe with the miraculous water, drawn from the well in Galatina.*

The room lacked

*The text does not contain a page number, but it is a continuation of the previous text. The young tarantata, a twenty-nine-year-old bride, regularly repeated a definite choreutic cycle, articulated partly on the floor and partly on her feet, and always finishing with a fall to the ground which marked a sort of rest. Beginning with this interval, during which the band struck up the tarante and the ‘arantata, lying supine on the ground, immediately began to move with the sounds, moving her head left and right to the tempo. Then, as if a sonorous wave had propagated itself throughout her body, she rose to her back, pushing herself with the movement of flexed legs and ala y planting her heels on the floor. Her head continued to strike the tempo violently, and the movement of her legs itself strictly obeyed the rhythm of the tarante. In this way, with her arms outstretched, the tarantata completed a round of the ceremonial perimeter. Then, she suddenly turned face vs - legs spread immobile, her arms bent below her bust and then her head still in rhythmic motion with her great mane visibly mimed a creature incapable of standing erect and which was, in fact, stuck to the ground — that is, the taranta. In this way, she identified with the taranta, dancing with it, and was the dancing beast itself.

This predominant identification with the spider was followed by a phase of agonistic detachment: the tarantata jumped to her feet, performing several times with a lively single or double hop, sometimes hopping in place, and occasionally forming some of the well-known figures of the traditional tarantella with the help of a colored cloth which she held in her hands (for example, arms slackened at her hips, holding the cloth at both ends; arms high and taut, holding the cloth at its ends above her head; arms flexed, one raised, the other lowered to her back, holding the cloth at its ends behind her back; etc.). During this phase, as in the preceding one, the tarantata strictly observed the rhythm; her dancing feet consistently beat the ground fifty times every ten seconds.

Finally, after a duration which was variable but never exceeded a quarter of an hour, the entire choreutic cycle drew to a close; the circle of its path began to tighten, her stability became uncertain, the rhythm was no longer followed with the usual rigor, and everything ended with a frenetic caracole which announced the fall that was near at hand, as if it were the result of her dizziness. With outstretched arms, women attendants formed a tight circle around the tarantata in order to block any careening or harmful falls, and they tried to hold her in their arms when the fall, disorderly but not violent, took place at the peak of the caracole (see photos 1-9). The band stopped playing, the tarantata was brought a glass of water and a pillow upon which to lay her head, and the musicians had their abundant sweat dried off by those present. Then, after a rest of about ten minutes, the band again took the initiative and the cycle was repeated in the exact same phases.

Throughout the entire performance of June 24, we noticed some interesting details. In both the phase on the floor and in the phase on her feet, the tarantata sometimes lingered for a while near the musicians as if she were fascinated by some instrument, nearly always the tambourine or violin. Her behavior and appearance demonstrated a desire to avidly absorb the rhythm of the tambourine and the melody of the violin, as if to evoke something critical to her whole being. In their turn, the musicians appeared to support these momentary inclinations which occasionally cropped up in the performance of the tarantata; in a passionate musical offering, they placed one instrument or another near her ears as the opportunity arose. In the phase on the floor, we once saw the tarantata drag herself to the feet of the violinist, and she lingered there as if she were magnetized. The violinist then knelt down next to her, playing so closely over her that it seemed that the bow had the woman’s body for its violin. At that moment, we recalled the song which was part of the repertory administered to tarantati in the seventeenth century:

Stu pettu é fattu cimbalu d’amuri,
Tasti li sensi mobili e accorti
Cordi li chianti, suspire e duluri
Rosa é lu cori miu feritu a morti
Strali é lu ferru, chiai so li miei arduri
Marteddu é lu pensieri, e la mia sorti
Mastra é la donna mia, ch’a tutti l’huri
Cantando canta leta la mia morti.

And indeed, everything was taking place before our eyes as if the body-taranta of the tarantata were transforming itself into a body-instrument, and thus into a rhythmic and melodic body, so as to reestablish a connection with some ciphered psychic distress. The musicians were the mediators, stimulators and guides of this event: in the standing phase, when the farantata—still hopping with the tempo—lingered in front of them among them, the tambourinist often made the rhythmic striking of the 4 pourine explode right next to her ears, with a swinging motion of both arms which gave the sonorous medicine the aspect of a beneficial spraying or even a justration. Just as often, the violinist bent toward the figure dancing next to or in front of him and communicated a very personal message of sound to her, and the end of which the magnetization ceased and the dancing figure returned to her rhythmic run around the ceremonial perimeter.

Another detail we noted had to do with chromatic symbolism. At a certain point in the event, a young man with a red- and yellow-striped shirt appeared at the door for a few moments. The tarantata, who was performing the upright phase in one of her choreutic cycles, immediately entered into a state of agitation; she no longer danced to the tempo and gave clear signs of interrupting the relationship which bound her to the musicians, the instruments and the music. In their turn, having perceived the disarticulation of the ceremonial performance, those present crowded near the door, shouting at the incautious youth that he had altered the apparatus’s functioning with the red and yellow of his shirt. The youth entrusted his legs with a rapid escape from the threats and accusations. However, it was necessary to repair the apparatus, which still did not function; the tarantata careened here and there as if she were intoxicated, and the band played in vain despite its desperate calls for redirecting the rebel planet back into orbit. There was only one way to repair the broken apparatus: throw yellow and red ribbons on the tarantata and let her vent the eccentric stimulation they provoked. Someone saw to procuring the necessary ribbons, and since it was not known which of the two colors was at issue, the members of her family began to test her. First, they threw a yellow ribbon on the tarantata without obtaining any effect, and then they threw a red one, which turned out to be the pertinent one since the tarantata flung herself upon it and savagely grabbed it; she stared at it with a gloomy, avid look as if to absorb the color, and finally she tore it with her teeth and executed some rapid, decisive somersaults.

The tarantata then placed herself back into the regular orbit of her ceremonial performance, allowing the band — which in the meantime had continued to play — to regain its mastery and control of her. The damage was repaired, the speck of dust which had filtered into the gears was eliminated, and the apparatus functioned again to the satisfaction of all.

"The musical-choreutic-chromatic exorcism of June 24 terminated toward evening in the most obvious way — with the musicians' fatigue. They had been working since the morning and were fully entitled to a rest, all the more so since the choreutic cycles followed each other without interruption, except for a pause of an hour and a half around noon. So, around ten o'clock, at the end of a choreutic cycle, the band set down their instruments and the tarantata was carried off to bed, where she lay tired, with her eyes closed. Yet, it could not be said the she was exhausted and incapable of continuing with her choreutic performance.

With a low and colorless voice she answered questions put to her by her family: "How do you feel?" "Better." "Did the Saint speak to you?" "Not yet." "Will he speak to you tonight?" "I don't know." But she remained stubbornly silent to many questions. The last two questions referred to dialogues between tarantati and St. Paul, who, because of the Christian graft of the Saint as protector of the tarantati, became associated with the traditional theme of dialogue between the tarantato and the taranta. At any rate, in our case the Saint had not yet granted the grace, and the treatment would have to continue through the next day.

The group was about to break up when a choleric, thickset little man suddenly burst into the hovel; he started shouting, yelling and giving orders with the air of being the boss of everyone and everything. He ordered the people to leave and to clear the room, protesting the presence of "outsiders" and especially the photographer who had transformed the scene into a circus act. We learned that this imposing character was the owner of the farm where the tarantata was currently a day-laborer. We also learned that he was in a certain sense the patron of the festival, because he had advanced the money to pay the musicians with the aim of effecting the cure and thereby regaining his worker — temporarily indisposed by the taranta — as quickly as possible. Later on there would always be time to get his money back in the form of unpaid workdays, which the tarantata would give him after having received the Saint's grace.

The following morning the team returned to Nard to be present when the tarantata awoke and the new series of choreutic cycles began. When the musicians struck their first chords around 10:00am, the tarantata remained immobile in bed, but when the tarantella broke out, the opening of the ritual day was signaled by a very loud yell accompanied by a bridge-like arching of her body. It was a classic hysterical arch, of the sort which nowadays one only reads of in books: heels planted, neck hyper-extended, arms half-bent, and body hyper-flexed. The "bridge" lasted a few seconds before the tarantata turned supine, but by then she was permeated with the sound wave; she moved to the music's tempo, her legs, arms, and body all limbered for the dance. The inclined plane of the bed facilitated her slide to the floor, where she immediately rose to her feet, sketching in an abbreviated form the upright phase of the first cycle in the series. After hardly a minute, she fell down and began the phase on the floor, and from that moment on, everything resumed according to the schema of the day before.

After an interruption from noon to one o'clock and the resumption which followed, we perceived that something decisive was on the way. The faces of her family members were less worried, and the people exchanged knowing glances as if to say, "Maybe we've done it." In one of the pauses, we asked our barber-violinist what his prognosis was; he shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows in an act of dignified professional caution, then, assuming the sure and bureaucratic tone of a railway employee giving information on train timetables to a passenger, he told us: "The Saint does the grace at twelve, one, three, or five. If the grace doesn't come at five o'clock, we'll have to wait till tomorrow." Then he showed us his wrist watch, which indicated half past two, accompanying the gesture with an expression which meant, "Figure it out for yourselves."

In folk Catholicism in this setting, grace is understood as a miracle; the saint is said to "do the grace" [fa la grazia].

In fact, as we learned from those present, hopeful signals had come forth: the tarantata had accepted a little food during the noontime rest, and in the course of the afternoon performance, she had "barked" several times—that is, she emitted small cries not unlike a dog's bark—these being signs of a grace on the way. Last, there was another promising sign in the fact that the tarantata began to execute briefer choreutic jerks, during which her behavior appeared freer and more varied in its figures.

In this way, while everyone probed these signals with trepidation, tarantata suddenly interrupted one of her innumerable rhythmic runs near the ceremonial perimeter, gestured to the musicians to stop playing, and headed with sure step to the bed, where she lay herself down; she looked at the scene a bit astonished and hinted at a smile. The grace had come at exactly 2:55, five minutes earlier than the foreseen hour; the emotion of her family and those present was great, while from afar the barber-violinist indicated to us the hands of his wrist watch, as if to invite us to verify the substantial exactness of his predictions.

Then the band struck up a tarantella of thanks to the Saint, with the subsidiary aim of making sure that the tarantata was truly indifferent to the stimulus of music and dance. But the tarantata remained immobile on the bed, serene and continuing to watch. Then the tambourinist fell to his knees, followed by all those present, and led prayers of thanks to the Saint. Mixed in with the crowd, the members of the research team were also on their knees, some with embarrassment and others with a slight excitement. As soon as it was possible, the team's doctor asked the tarantata some explorative questions, and from the replies he obtained he was able to deduce that her notion of time had remained suspended from the previous day, when the exorcism had begun (she thought it was Thursday, when it was actually Friday). She knew that she had danced, but did not remember anything of what had taken place during the dance. Among other things, she did not recall that the team members were present for her choreutic performances, and indeed, she believed that they had entered the hovel for the first time that very moment. As for the concluding episode of the grace, she reported to have suddenly heard the Saint's voice, which, in low tone and in dialect, had distinctly murmured in her ears, "I am doing the grace for you."

The tarantata answered the doctor's questions as if submerged in a sweet languor, answering with some delay, slowly, in a soft voice, saving her words. At a certain point, the tarantata expressed the desire to go immediately to Galatina to thank the Saint, so we offered to take her in our car. The offer was accepted, but her family warned us to be careful upon entering the fiefdom, as the tarantata—even though she was now calm—would inevitably be agitated in the fatal moment of crossing. And indeed, when a certain tree which serves as a mystical boundary-marker appeared in the car window, the tarantata had a moment of abandon, which she came out of right away.

We arrived at the chapel of Galatina; the tarantata entered, and in the form of an homage to the Saint, she repeated the choreutic cycle performed during the home exorcism without any musical accompaniment, but the rhythmic run in a circle was transformed into circles around the altar. Then she drank a glass of water drawn from the miraculous well, and lastly, she carefully placed all of the money collected in the two days of dancing in the donations box.

The tarantata would return to Galatina on June 29 to join the other women and participate in the chapel scenes; for now, however, everything was over, and there was nothing left for us to do but take her back to Nard, where we left her.

However much the exorcism of June 24 and 25 allowed us to capture the mythical-ritual symbol of the taranta in its concrete functioning, the tarantata still remained for us more of a shadow than a person. She appeared to us in the act of pouring her own particular psychic drama into the mythical-ritual pattern offered by tarantism, but what the content of this drama might be was still unknown to us.

The tarantata had mimed the agonistic identification with the "taranta" that bit her, and with the aid of St. Paul, protector of tarantati, she freed herself from the poison, at least until the next calendrical period. But if "the taranta," "the poison," and "St. Paul" were symbols, it now remained to establish what concrete psychic drama they were a symbolic horizon for in this specific case.

Thus, in the following days, the team was occupied with reconstructing this drama as much as possible, or at least delineating its probable lines of development. The tarantata—to whom we will now give the pseudonym Maria of Nardo*—was a tobacco harvester and gleaner, and had been married to a peasant for nine years. At age thirteen, she lost her father, to whom she had been particularly attached, "because he brought her things from the market." After this tragedy, she was taken in together with her mother into an uncle's home and subsequently that of an aunt. Always badly tolerated by whoever hosted her and not getting along well with her mother, she passed her adolescent years in all sorts of trouble. At age eighteen, she fell in love with a young man, but for economic reasons, his family opposed marriage, and the youth left her. Maria suffered a great deal due to the abandonment of her first love, which happened suddenly. One Sunday at noon, she was bitten by a taranta and compelled to dance. A woman with a son to marry off set her sights on Maria, thinking she could be a possible wife for her sickly and often unemployed son, even if she was tarantata.

The mother and son accompanied Maria to the chapel in Galatina to render homage to the Saint, and on one of these occasions, the mother asked Maria if she would have her son as a husband. Maria, who still held her first love in her heart, did not speak her mind and presented the excuse of not having money for her trousseau due to the taranta that forced her to dance and incur constant debts with the musicians.

The mother and son did not give up and continued to solicit the girl. In the meantime, a new character, St. Paul, appeared and ordered her not to marry, calling her to a mystical marriage with him. The mother and son sent a woman to Maria's home, asking her to follow them. They wanted to speak to her at a farmhouse.

Maria reluctantly gave in to their insistence and moved to the farmhouse. A few days later, she woke up weak and without appetite, uninclined to do the household chores. Her concubine ordered her to iron the linens, and a quarrel broke out.

On her way to a neighbor's house to return the iron, she met Saints Peter and Paul on the road, who told her to forget the iron and come with them. It was Sunday, at noon, the exact day and time she had been bitten by the taranta for the first time and received the first summons from St. Paul.

After roaming in the fields for three days, Maria returned to her family. St. Paul, unhappy with her for disobeying his order not to marry, had her stung once again, forcing her to dance for nine days. The whole neighborhood knew she had been in the farmhouse with the youth, so a wedding was necessary. Maria agreed to a wedding with her new suitor but maintained her seasonal relationship with the taranta and the Saint, renewing the crises and dances each year.

The story's interpretation doesn't seem difficult. The "first bite" took place after her disappointment in love, showing its symbolic character. The attribution of a day and hour, which are canonical in tarantism, also reveals a pact of loyalty and mystical marriage to St. Paul. What was not possible on earth was projected into heaven, and St. Paul constituted the sublimated figure of her first unlucky love. On the same day and at the same hour as those of the first bite, the jealous Saint came to take her from the farmhouse to which she had fled, violating their pact, and he punished the betrayal by renewing the “bite” and “poison,” forcing her to dance. Compelled by circumstance to marry a man whom she did not love, Maria periodically continued to pay her tribute to the taranta and the Saint, each time reciting the event of the bite of love in the symbolism of the ritual, and each time being cured through the grace of her heavenly husband, the projection and sublimation of the ground she had irremediably lost. In the mythical-ritual horizon of tarantism and the Christian graft of St. Paul’s figure, Maria periodically released her conflicts and converted her frustrations into symbol, lightening the periods between ceremonies — that is, daily life — of the burden of unconscious stimulations which would have been extremely dangerous had she not found a socialized and traditionalized project of calendrical, festive treatment in tarantism. Through the mythic order of “taranta,” “bite,” “poison” and St. Paul, Maria gave a form to frustrating psychic conflicts, and through the ritual order of music, dance and colors, she got in touch with these conflicts through an annual treatment which evoked them in time and place and made them communicate with the plane of symbolic creations proposed by the Myth. At the same time, Maria released aggressive drives against her undesired husband in an alienated form; she upset her conjugal life, economically harmed the family she did not love, and clamorously drew public attention — normally uninterested in her — to her drama. The seriousness of Maria’s personal and social conflicts found an echo in the responses to Rorschach Cards II, V, VII and IX, which manifest macabre, aggressive and violent themes. During the administration of the word-association test, Maria replied to the word “bite” [morso] with “remorse [rimorso, also ‘re-bite’], what makes you cry.””6 From a theoretical point of view, a case of tarantism observed in a “complete” fashion would involve the possibility of catching the episode of “first bite” and the “first crisis” in action, of being present at the first musical-choreutio- chromatic exorcism and following the subsequent periodical connections between the renewed crises and the repetition of the ceremonial treatment from year to year, with all of its possible annual variations. Moreover, such a case would permit the reconstruction of the psychic biography of the tarantato, starting with his infancy, utilizing all of the instruments for the analysis of the unconscious which modern psychology has at its disposal. Obviously, none of the cases we observed fulfills these requirements, in the first place because of the limited time the team was in the field (from June 22 to July 10), and in the second place because the instruments of analysis available to us did not go beyond standard ethnographic recording obtained through interviews based on structured questionnaires, the psychiatrist’s evaluation, the administration of the Rorschach test, and a word-association list. In any case, even if in a purely relative sense, the case of Maria of Nardé was one of the most complete the team managed to observe, and it served to orient the study as a whole by posing a series of problems and stimulating us to cross-check and supplement the data as other cases gradually came forth. The symbolic autonomy of tarantism: a case study

Among other things, the case of Maria of Nardé had highlighted how tarantism constituted a symbolic apparatus for evoking and configuring on the mythical-ritual level those psychic conflicts which had not found a resolution on the level of consciousness and which operated in the darkness of the unconscious, with the risk of appearing as neurotic symptoms. These conflicts were periodically released and produced on the mythical-ritual level, relieving the periods between ceremonies of the weight of their urges, and facilitating a relative psychic equilibrium in those periods. In this way, we outlined the possibility of considering tarantism in a perspective in which certain conflicts found a horizon in a symbolic system of “first bite” and “re-bites” lived out according to traditionalized and socialized ways, times and places: the ways of the musical-choreutic-chromatic exorcism, the times of the seasonal and festive calendar, the places of home, fiefdom and chapel.

The very day of June 24, a few hours before leaving for Nard6, where we were to encounter the case of Maria, at the chapel of Galatina we had the opportunity to observe another case of particular interest for illustrating the symbolic-cultural autonomy of tarantism. This was the case of a seventy-one-year-old peasant woman, Filomena of Cerfignano, whom we saw seated in the chapel on the altar's steps in the act of reciting the misfortune which had befallen her, in keeping with ceremonial procedure. At her feet, there was a branch of chick peas, to which the tarantata seemed bound by a particular affective relationship (see photos 27-29). Filomena lamented of her illness, listing a series of ailments affecting various parts of her body. She also recounted the episode of the "first bite" that had occurred five days earlier, when she was seating on a threshing-floor picking chick peas from a branch. A small argument with her husband led to the taranta stinging her. Filomena saw it flee down her leg, where it left a dark little mark, and she had no doubt as to what had happened to her. She stood up yelling and entered the house, where she saw a small "green spider near the bed, the very one responsible for the attack a few moments earlier.

Filomena's husband provided an explanation for the taranta's movement, which involved an image relevant to Latrodectus but not Lycosa, as he believed the spider flew with the wind by making long threads. Filomena was asked why she had not killed the taranta at the moment of the sting or when she saw it near the bed, and she replied that the saranta was "a creature of St. Paul and to kill it would have been an offense to the Saint. Her husband, for his part, confirmed that the taranta had been "sent" by the Saint. After the episode of the threshing-floor and the sighting of the taranta, Filomena began to feel a pain rising up from the site of the sting to her abdomen, and then she felt the other symptoms from which she was still suffering. The very day of the first bite, Filomena headed for the chapel in Galatina, but the visit had no effect. An old woman in the chapel reminded her that in order to be cured, it was necessary to wear the clothes she wore at the moment of the “first bite” and to carry the most important objects which had a reference to the situation in which the first bite had taken place. So Filomena returned to Cerfignano; she dressed herself exactly as she was dressed when she was stung and took the branch of chick peas which she had in her hand at that moment. Thus refashioned, so to speak, in the evocative images of the initial scene which had marked the onset of the crisis, Filomena returned to the chapel. Her husband explained to us that his wife had not been bitten by a “dancer,” “singer” or “libertine” taranta, and therefore she did not dance; she did not feel stimulated by lively songs, nor did she abandon herself to lascivious mimicry. Her taranta was just “sad and Silent,” disdaining the rhythm of the tarantella and inducing a melancholy state of mind in its victim which was best expressed with a funeral lament. The data which it was possible to gather on Filomena’s story did not permit us to decide exactly what the conflict was in this case that had found its symbolic horizon in tarantism. In point of fact, we could not completely rule out the possibility that five days earlier a real episode of arachnidism had taken place, however much this appeared highly improbable. It was clear in any case — 4 The Inoperative Symbol The case of Filomena of Cerfignano had shown us how the symbolic horizon of tarantism provided not only for a dancer, singer or libertine taranta, but also for a “sad and silent” taranta associated with states of depression. As our investigation proceeded, we realized that a depressive element always operated in tarantism, and although the rhythm of the tarantella normally dissolved this variously-manifested element, occasionally the tarantati did not appreciate the tarantella. Instead, they wanted music marked by a sorrowful nostalgia or even bemoaned their plight according to the melodic and mime patterns of traditional funeral lament. But we made yet another observation: in some cases the symbol of tarantism did not operate at all; the sounds and colors did not evoke anything; the choreutic impulse was not released by the unfolding of musical rhythms and colored ribbons. The tarantato wandered about listless or depressed in the ceremonial perimeter as if he were seeking in vain to take part in an event which had nothing to do with him, while the band continued its sonorous treatments without success. In one of the hovels of Nardé on the morning of July 1, we attended an exorcism of this type, reduced to little more than a series of failed attempts, An eighteen-year-old fisherman was center-stage, a first-time ‘arantato; after Filomena, then, this was a new case of tarantism in statu nascendi. The youth, named Michele, wandered about inside the ceremonial perimeter without observing the rhythm of the tarantella in the slightest. From time to time he sketched a “dash” step, completely out of tempo, only to return immediately to his aimless roaming. Sometimes he bent over to gather the ribbons and colored rags strewn on the floor; he contemplated them for a few moments and then threw them away shaking his head disconsolately, or else he clasped them in his hands in a gesture of great desperation. He picked up the images of Saints Peter and Paul which were also strewn on the floor, gazing at their display of green, red and blue. He idolized them, kissed them, and had them kissed by those present; but then he shook his head again, disconsolate, and threw them to the ground angrily. A little bunch of wildflowers attracted his attention; he took one, brought it to his nose in the act of smelling it longingly, as if he were trying to obtain a stimulation through smell which did not come from hearing or sight — but this was another failure, accompanied by the same disconsolate mime. He asked that a friend be sent for with whom he might have been able to dance. The friend arrived shortly thereafter and the two tried to dance together, but the attempt failed pitifully. The band did all it could in the meantime: with a swinging motion of his arms, the tambourinist strained with all his strength to emit a spray of sounds from his instrument; the barber-violinist leaned forward in an attempt to transmit the moaning THE INOPERATIVE SYMBOL 51 sages of his violin to the recalcitrant youth — but it was all futile. At a point in the middle of the musical offering, the uncooperative youth Bed, imploring: “Enough! Leave me alone! What are all these people doing oats Go away!” Then, as if speaking to himself: “I don’t feel up to it, I'm Sed. I’ma strong lad, but now I’m tired.” Failure was looming on the horizon. The musicians were exhausted and discouraged, the audience showed signs of concern, and someone in the family wept softly. But after a pause the band obstinately struck up its musical offering once more, until the recalcitrant youth, who had again taken up his desperate wandering, suddenly decided to Jam himself miraculously healed; but he did it with such bad grace* that it was all too clear that this was simply a way to call things off. The scene of prayers of thanks and litanies followed, to which we had already been spectators in the home of Maria of Nardo, except that in this case the miraculously-healed youth appeared annoyed by what was taking place, and from time to time he had to be hushed with gestures and called to order by those present. The final act of this exorcism gone awry was the trip to Galatina to give thanks, which had to be completed at all costs. Once again, we offered to take the tarantato to the chapel, and we did this in the company of his father and a cousin. In the car, the farantato hardly behaved like someone who had just received divine grace; in any case, he seemed scarcely convinced of the grace or of the thanks to be rendered to the Saint. The entrance to the fiefdom passed completely unobserved, and on our arrival at the chapel the tarantato wanted to stay in the car a few more minutes to finish smoking a cigarette which he had been given during the trip. He entered the chapel and wandered about absent- _ mindedly, and then he went to the Mother Church to deliver the donations collected during his miserable choreutic performance. Hurriedly, he handed the coins bound in a handkerchief to a priest, and after he had washed his face at the holy water stoup, he headed back home. In the days that followed, we tried as best we could to reconstruct the biography of this tarantato and the incidents surrounding the onset of his crisis. The tarantato in question, Michele of Nardo, was the second of six children, the last of whom was eight months old. He lived his early childhood in the midst of the difficulties of the war years (he was born in 1941), all the greater in a poor family like his, Until the age of Seven he was cared for by his maternal grandmother, who spent her days at her daughter’s home, although she lived elsewhere. He went to school to no avail — he attended first grade for two years and second grade for two more, until he dropped out and was sent to apprentice in a carpenter's shop together with his brother, two years older than he. Being more talented than Michele, his brother continually reproached him for his incompetence. Often Michele did not want to go to the shop, so his older brother beat him. The apprenticeship Proved a failure, so Michele went to work in agriculture, hoeing and tending Olive groves and vineyards in the vicinity of Nardo. Then his father, who owned a boat in Porto Lapillo, took him along to fish, and so Michele began to alternate day-labor in the fields with an occupation as fisherman.

In January 1959, his grandmother was left paralyzed. This profoundly shocked Michele, since his grandmother had been a mother to him in a family in which he was little appreciated due to his ineptitude, and in which his more talented older brother did not spare him thrashings in order to affirm his authority.

On June 10, 1959, Michele went fishing with his father. Upon coming ashore, he did not want to go home to Nardé and instead preferred to stay in Porto Lapillo in an abandoned little house on the seashore. He was not a fearful youth; he had stayed alone in that house before and had even faced rough seas — but that night he was afraid. At a certain point his dog barked and he heard a noise of people, as if the house were besieged. He looked out the window, and though he did not see anything, he took a rifle from the wall and fired a few shots into the darkness.

The next night the siege was repeated, and this time Michele saw a crowd around the house and people waving daggers at him. This time, though, his dog had not barked. This made Michele so furious that a few days later he took the dog, tied a stone around its neck, and threw it into the sea; he then returned to Nardo.

On June 25, his older brother ran away from home, stealing 11,000 lire from his parents; later it was learned that he had gone to Rome to look for work. Michele tried to console his mother, who was in tears: "Don't think about him, Mamma." But a few days later his brother returned, as often happens with these flights "to Rome" attempted by restless Salentine youths. The mother was ready to pardon him, but Michele seized the opportunity to vent old, suppressed grudges and threw himself on his brother, crying: "You came back, you wretch!" The mother intervened to defend the prodigal son, and Michele was forced to remain silent.

That very afternoon — it was Sunday — Michele went to the cinema and saw a film dealing with a crime of jealousy among fishermen. As if the film had alluded to something regarding him very directly, Michele left the theater distraught. He wanted to confess and receive Communion, and was seen by many in the act of receiving the Sacrament in church.

On Monday morning, while repairing his bicycle, he felt an unusual stimulus from some dance tunes broadcast by a radio. He ate normally and made up with his brother, but he continued to feel oppressed, so much so that his father decided to take him along to the sea to distract him. While they bicycled the road to Porto Lapillo, Michele confided to his father his fear that he was a tarantato. He suggested that a misdeed committed some days earlier explained his state: chatting with friends who were planning to go to the upcoming festival in Galatina, he had blurted out in irritation that St. Paul and his festival could go to the devil. They returned from Porto Lapillo in the afternoon, and Michele wanted to be taken to the chapel in Galatina, but his state of depression continued. In the evening he asked for an accordion and began to play it, forcing his older brother and a friend to listen to him and cry while he played; in the end, the two started crying in earnest, until Michele decided to rest a while around midnight. The next morning, which was Tuesday, his family and neighbors decided to call the musicians; this was the background to the scenes we witnessed that very morning. The data gathered in this case intimated a biography punctuated by traumas and frustrations, dominated by jealousy of the older brother; in all probability, THE INOPERATIVE SYMBOL 53 jcidal tensions had also emerged (administration of the Rorschach test * indicated serious conflicts with his environment).”’ It was clear in -_— a Michele had sought to lend a horizon to his conflicts through a cabri l symbolism of tarantism, aided in this by intense pressure pate ely an a But th ration did not succeed, for reasons Bec castictoncerain. = E chals of Nard, the symbol of the taranta was not able to assert its on « of musical-choreutic-chromatic evocations and releases, in another ro who in a certain sense represents the most extreme case of the ets tack of efficacy — the traditional exorcism had given rise to a series of Be caderty, inconclusive choreutic displays with no seasonal discipline.

Giorgio had been left to himself ) “ a child and had not attended school; after the death of his father, “tee on a half-sister who did her best to help him. It was precisely this hal: oe who told us a version of events that was rich in detail, substantially exact an conscientious, as we were able to establish through subsequent verifications. In April of 1958, Giorgio used to travel the road to Santa Cesarea every day ina motortricycle to load fruits and vegetables, which he then resold in Colatone: On one of these trips, the motortricycle — driven by his cousin — killed a snake. Giorgio was very upset by this, and the following nights he began to complain "that he felt a mysterious presence on the mouth of his stomach, and that he = something enter through the window — he could not tell if it was a traditiona monacello® or perhaps even the dove of the Holy Spirit. Since the eee Suggested by the local doctor were of no avail, his half-sister decided to take him to Taranto “to a professor of sorcery [fatture],” but the professor did not __ achieve any better results than the doctor had. Neighbors suggested trying the “sounds,” and indeed, on June 12 of that year, Giorgio danced for four days, _ until the marshal of the carabinieri of Galatone prohibited the dance because the collection of money which took place was not authorized. The half-sister and all present protested that the hovel was a private home, and that the oe Was entirely destined to St. Paul (that is, to the chapel of Galatina), but the Marshal was unyielding, and the dance had to be suspended to the a. detriment of Giorgio, who said that he had not yet satisfied his _ . Stimulus. Things were already looking bad, because it was highly irregu i have such an insatiable need to dance without the Saint deciding to cme o grace. On this point, the half-sister made the following comment: “It couldn't be * The monacello is a mythical, gnome-like trickster spirit in Southern Italian folklore.

The half-sister donated a gold snake to the chapel to amend the probable offence to St. Paul brought about by killing the snake on the road to Santa Cesarea. The parish priest willingly accepted the gift, but had it transferred to the Mother Church for fear that someone might steal it from the chapel. Since the Saint did not bestow the grace, they turned to a psychiatrist in Lecce who prescribed a treatment, but Giorgio did not want to have anything to do with it because “by that time, he only had faith in the Saints,” Between Christmas and New Year’s Day, out of season but in a telling coincidence with the holiday period, Giorgio again wanted to dance for four days; since the marshal in Galatone would not give permission to do so, the entire group moved to Nardo. After four days of dancing with no grace forthcoming, Giorgio was no longer able to dance: he rose when the orchestra struck up the sit down again.” In any case, with the donations collected in those four days of dancing, the floor of the chapel in Galatina was March, 1959 — again out of season — the impulse to dance became irresistible, But the half-sister, who bore the expense, began to mount resistance owing to — the economic difficulties which these endless dances had provoked. Giorgio began to cry and reproached his half-sister for having lost faith in St. Paul; she replied that she had not lost faith in the Saint, but while the grace arrived for others within a “normal” period of time, in his case St. Paul appeared unwilling to concede it. At any rate, the half-sister consented to another attempt. The group returned to Galatone, since this time the marshal would turn a blind eye, and Giorgio‘ danced for eighteen days in the hovel, which was transformed for the occasion into a sort of chapel full of holy images and lit with dozens of votive candles. Giorgio was then taken to Galatina and confessed along with his half-sister. Leaving confession in the Mother Church, he threw himself at the feet of the priest, kissed them devotedly, and then announced to his half-sister: “Now I will die. It is St. Paul’s wish, because I must become a Saint.” His body stiffened in a position of prayer, and remaining stiffened he was taken away. At this point — March 24, 1959 — he was admitted to the psychiatric hospital in Lecce, from which he was released on April 17. He went to the home of his step-mother ~ not his half-sister’s — but his stay was brief, since he was turned out for “having made a spectacle of himself to the young ladies of the house”; and so he went back to his sister’s. At this point, his behavior became even more eccentric: he went around the town and people put on records to see him dance and sing in the street. Once he even barricaded himself in the house, scattering linens and dressing himself in an odd fashion. So he returned to the hospital on May 25, where our team’s doctor went to visit him, yielding the following report for us: “See note 4 above. than three or four days.

His it behavior can be described as normal. Data obtained from the interview with subject — as from the Rorschach test and the accounts of family members - Suggest the dissociated state presented in this case might be attributed to a schizophrenic process rather than to hysteria. a Remorse in the Dog Days The event of the “first bite” and the nature of the “re-bites” were central to one of the most delicate questions of the entire investigation. The case of Pietro of Nardo had shown that even when an episode of latrodectism had initially taken place, tarantism immediately grafted itself onto the toxic syndrome and continued to carry out its symbolic order well after the syndrome had run its course. With regard to the two episodes of “first bite” we encountered during our investigation — those of Filomena of Cerfignano and Michele of Nardd — several data argued in favor of the symbolic character of the “bite,” “poison” and “crisis,” with no relation to any form of arachnidism whatsoever. The same could be said for the cases of Maria of Nardé and Giorgio of Galatone. During our investigation, indications pointing in this direction grew more and more numerous; by the end, none of us had any doubt as to the fact that latrodectism does not at all contribute to the understanding of tarantism as a cultural phenomenon, even if—in single cases—it could actually have provided the opportunity for putting the symbolic apparatus into motion, and even if—as we will see later on—it historically had an important part in conditioning the phenomenon in past centuries.

The details of the first crisis which the tarantati and their families consistently related to us substantiated the correctness of this interpretation. Pantalea of Giuggianello, age forty-one, was stung by the taranta at age eighteen, and thus had been a tarantata for twenty-three years; she had the first crisis “two weeks after her father’s death,” when she was still in the crisis of mourning. She began to feel “wounded,” that is, weakened in her physical and psychic forces, and she shivered with cold and fever. One day, sitting “weary” on a chair—the term “weary” indicates the characteristic tedium of tarantati—a neighboring woman “gave her the signal” with a tambourine; that is, she explored her with the rhythmic percussion of the instrument which more than any other stimulates tarantati to “scazzicarsi” in dance. Pantalea responded immediately to the “signal” and danced for a night on her feet and on the floor, dialoguing with St. Paul. From then on, every year around June she would begin to feel “wounded,” to the point that she fell into convulsions or was immersed in a state of inertia in which she heard all without being able to move or respond. Moreover, in the same seasonal period, the rhythmic beat of footsteps on the wooden floor of the tobacco storehouse “wearied” her and induced her irresistibly to dance.

Sixty-six-year-old Rita of Alezio, tarantata for forty years, underwent her “first bite” in the following series of events: she suffered from convulsions from the time she was a youth, and then around age thirty—already married with children—her ovaries were removed; immediately after the operation the convulsions ceased, but she was stung by the taranta.

She seemed to recollect having suffered ; first bite while kneeling in prayer, but she also remembered a walk in the uintry in her youth and a “big, yellow” spider responsible for the events ich followed. Since then, every summer Matilde was bitten and re-bitten y the spiders; she saw them, felt their sting, called them by name venne ia Antonietta) and answered their call. These spiders gave her orders; or ‘ample, they prohibited her from eating certain foods, forced her to a in certain way, commanded her to stay away from certain persons; she hai | to bey their petty tyrannies, otherwise they would avenge themselves by making feel “wounded. Matilde considered her spiders to be authentic persecutors, 'bonded to each other by kinship, as children or grandchildren. In her sixty years of tarantism, she had encountered all types: big and small, yellow and sometimes in her food (and so she could not eat it) and once even in the 'ost when she was on the point of receiving Communion. As the festival of Galatina approached each year, the spiders reappeared, and she felt wounded and was stimulated to dance. While she was still young and her father was alive, the sounds for dancing were always called; but then, left an orphan and alone in the world, little by little she did away with the sounds, limiting herself to _ dancing and singing old rustic songs, or even religious songs, and beating the _ tempo on the table from time to time.

It is evident that events of this type, though summary, give a glimpse of the symbolic character of the "bites" and "re-bites" of the tarantati, no matter _ what the initial occasions might have been which put the traditional symbolism into motion. We reached the same conclusion through an analogous case, Which we had the chance to analyze with particular care by way of a series of interviews with the tarantata and her family. Eighteen-year-old Carmela of San Pietro Vernotico had suffered her "first bite" in connection with the period of her puberty. At age thirteen, in autumn — and therefore out of season — she had the first worrisome sign: all of the sudden she began to bark like a dog. But, our informants commented, since it was autumn the barking did not last long and the girl recovered. The following summer, however, the . Teappeared along with a string of other symptoms: stomach ache, localize: so, in the 58 SALENTO 1959 pains, intolerance for certain foods and odors, When she saw these foods or noticed these odors, Carmela fled barking and went to neighboring women or to a shop, asking for hard bread and anchovies — in short, in her tastes she behaved "just like a pregnant woman." A local doctor advised the family to obtain a zito for her, a fiancé; however, a youth who seemed a possible match soon began to have trouble with the girl's character, which was worsening despite the engagement, to the point that she walked the streets gesturing unbecomingly, emitting cries and groans, The youth confided in an old woman of Tuturano (evidently a fattuchiera [sorceress], who gave her oracular response: "If the taranta that stung her has had children, the girl will dance until the seventh generation of its descendants," The youth reported this response to Carmela's mother, who did not give it much credence; having had a tarantata sister, she was an expert in the matter and did not perceive symptoms of tarantism in her daughter's behavior. Carmela was brought to a psychiatrist in Lecce, but in the meantime she began to manifest symptoms which were closer and closer to the traditional symbolic framework. The night of June 20, 1956, Carmela dreamed of many scorzoni, a type of small snake; the next night she dreamed of a great green lawn, on which "a youth with a white beard" in a green suit and red cape approached her. Carmela immediately recognized St. Paul, and she hurried to ask him to make her well. To which the Saint replied: "Come to my town, and I will do the grace for you In that very same moment, as if to second the words of the Saint, a swarm of scorzoni came towards her on the lawn, while the Saint reassured her: “Don’t be afraid, they are the holy souls of purgatory.” Then, in the center of the lawn, Carmela saw a large, heavy, flat stone, “a sort of cement platform,” which suddenly split open, and she could see a good deal of water in the fissure. Upon reawakening, Carmela complained of characteristic ailments which announced her forthcoming menarche, and she stayed in bed. On the third day she got up, complaining of difficulty standing, even to the extent of asking for crutches. Her worried family sent for a band which drew close to her house, playing various types of music to explore what reactions the girl might have. As long as the band played dance tunes currently in vogue, Carmela remained indifferent, but as soon as the first strikes of the tambourine vibrated in the air to announce the traditional tarantella, her face went pale and she fell to the ground in a faint. Precisely in that moment she had the menarche which transformed her into a woman. Immediately thereafter, a rousing tarantella began which — with the usual brief pauses — lasted for two and a half hours and was repeated for five subsequent days. From then on, every summer Carmela felt an irresistible inclination to dance. Once, she had to rush out of the town cinema because the music of the song “Lazzarella” prevented her from staying seated and stimulated her to dance. Sometimes the rhythmic pulse of a threshing-machine or the cadenced striking of a ladle in a copper pot was enough to make her scazzicare. Her passion for dancing often coincided with her menstrual period; in this case, her mother “transported” her — that is, she delayed her daughter’s dancing until her menstruation was over. In the opinion of the family and the tarantata herself, a “scorpion” was wholly responsible; during the dance, Carmela “saw it”: it was black, “in livery” with hairy legs, protruding lips and a coachman’s hat, tall with a d near the brim. In connection with the colors of her scorpion, Carmela — clutching a black rag and a grey rag in her hands. In the pause between one dance and another, during her rest on the bed, Carmela spoke with the scorpion, enduring its threats; she made an agreement as to the length of the dance and the date of the next crisis; and in connection with various “a oe cried, laughed and yelled. After the dance, which she executed with a sorbed expression but with open eyes, she remembered all that had happened to her: visions, conversations and external surroundings. As case, too, time and the available instruments of analysis did not permit a detailed determination of the conflicts which had found their symbolic expression in tarantism. On the basis of data collected, it was barely possible to intuit that the dynamic had to do with conflicts in relation to family life and the 5 ae of puberty, and that the “first bite” most probably had its basis in the kr: koning of ties to her father on the occasion of her puberty (think of a St. Paul as a youth with a “white beard,” the cement platform with the split, giving a glimpse of water in the crack, and the menarche which followed). In any case, the data were sufficient to confirm the symbolic interpretation of her tarantism in general, and of her “first bite” in particular. The girl’s environment was saturated with symbolic connections asserted with great seriousness and without the slightest doubt; the judgments of family members during our interviews gave us ample evidence of this, for example, her sister told us that perhaps the girl barked like a dog — the scorpion had stung a dog which had in turn “breathed on Carmela; and since the dog died as a result of the poisoned bite, Carmela had to dance in its place. "According to her father, Carmela danced in the summer because in this season the spider’s web was taut and dry, and the spider could run and dance on slender threads at ease, communicating its movement to the girl; in the winter, though, the web became soft and wet and did not bear the dance of the spider, which remained immobile in the center of the web, leaving the girl in peace. For the same reason, in her mother’s opinion, the tarantata never danced past one o'clock in the morning, when the nocturnal humidity softened the web, lessening the spider’s mobility. The whole family agreed in asserting that while Carmela danced, scorpions from the garden next door approached the room as if they were enchanted by the music; indeed, the last time a scorpion entered the room and began to dance on the floor together with Carmela. Her mother maintained that the scorpion which had stung her daughter must have been “old,” “maybe a hundred years old,” because her daughter often danced on the floor; when the scorpion or faranta was young, standing figures in which the tarantata perhaps held onto a rope suspended from the ceiling to facilitate her balance. Once they had put a rope up for Carmela, too, the girl did not use it, therefore the scorpion was really old. The neighboring households also participated in this atmosphere of mystical relations; two neighboring women confided to us that on one evening in which Carmela received the visit of St. Paul (that is, one of the graces which the Saint bestows at the end of the 60 SALENTO 1959 seasonal choreutic rounds), the figures of Saints Cosma and Damiano loomed in the garden next door. At the same time, Carmela’s family also ingenuously trusted science’s potential in this field. This was demonstrated not so much by the fact that they had gone many times to the best psychiatrists in Lecce, as by the moving devotion with which they sought to help us in our research, secretly hoping that we would find the way to cure their girl and put an end to an affair which was upsetting the family finances and kept their hearts in suspense every summer. A few days after the team’s return to Rome, we received a telegram which made us feel all of the responsibility of our research, reminding us in the most brutal way that the tarantati were not only documents of another age, but living persons to whom we had current obligations. The telegram read: “Carmela is dancing. Come.” The cases of Pantalea of Giuggianello, Matilde of Cutrofiano and Carmela of San Pietro Vernotico were of interest not only because they highlighted the symbolism of “bites” and “re-bites,” but also because they accented the “hallucinatory” character of tarantism with particular vigor. The great majority of the tarantati dialogued with an appointed voice — that of the taranta or of St. Paul (or of St. Paul-taranta or taranta-St. Paul; the distinction was not always clear). Thus, for example, Pietro of Nardé described the voice of the Saint (“Far away, low, like a voice heard over the telephone”) and his visible figure (“in full relief, normal height, with a sword, book and colors, as in the sacred images distributed at the festival of Galatina”). But the hallucinations sometimes absolved yet another function besides that of relating to the taranta and St. Paul: in the moment of crisis they anticipated “the sounds” which the tarantato ardently needed to execute the musical exorcism. One tarantata, who was not counted in the sample because at the time of our investigation she had no longer been one for several years, had the usual signs on the occasion of the initial episode: headache, depressive state, and so on. The doctor ordered her to go for a period of rest in the country, which she did. But one morning, while sitting and complaining about her headache, she saw a group of running horses, shaking bells similar to the sound of a tambourine. The jingling irresistibly induced her to rhythmically beat her foot on the floor without being able to stop. The women of the neighborhood were called, who at such a clear sign diagnosed, "It's taranta." The tarantata asked to send for some musicians whom she had already heard other times during the many musical exorcisms she had attended as a spectator; her wish was immediately granted, and the choreutic round had an auspicious beginning.

The relative facility with which tarantism is connected to hallucinatory phenomena presented a new argument in favor of the essentially symbolic character not only of the "re-bites" but also of the vast majority of "first bites." The tarantati and their families often mentioned initial episodes connected with real bites, but then they indicated an imaginary spot on the body to demonstrate. Saints Cosma and Damiano are particularly revered in Apulia; known as the "Holy Doctors," they are often invoked by devotees in health-related matters.

REMORSE IN THE DOG DAYS 61

In this text, the word "remorse" should be removed as it is part of a header or footer, showing a page number. The text has been cleaned up and separated wrongly appended words. 

Moreover, qualitative analysis confirmed the cultural conditioning of a distribution that even in the raw numerical data was sufficient to at Log be noticed. It was in Nardo that we encountered the most demonstrative case: two sisters and a brother, tarantati in the same family. The first sister, thirty-one-year-old Cristina, had suffered her first bite at age nineteen, when she had been married for two years. The occasion of the bite was a purulent otitis — putting the traditional symbolism of tarantism into motion. Cristina saber of being bitten while shelling fava beans. She was treated with music, which stimulated her to dance seated, moving her head and an arm in rhythm on the side of the afflicted ear until "the dirt" came out of it; she then remained well for that year. In the hot season of subsequent years, she danced with her brother Cosimo, age eighteen, who was struck two years earlier: he had suffered violent head pains, did not eat, and slept a great deal. The doctor penetrated Sunstroke, and perhaps the occasion of his tarantism was just that; but the Sunstroke, if there was one, put the usual traditional symbolism into motion along with the pressure and influence of an environment already prepared to receive connections of this sort. His sister Rosaria, age thirteen, had inaugurated her tarantism three years earlier at age ten. She was going to the beach when "a light-blue snake with staring eyes" suddenly blocked her path and "cast a spell on her." She rushed home and was seized with high fever and vomiting. A few evenings later, while eating a bit of bread, the sound of an accordion reached her ears. Rosaria threw herself on the bed, yelling that the music gave her intense stomach pains. Everyone then understood that a taranta was responsible; indeed, as soon as the accordionist was called to carry out the confirming exploration, Rosaria began to dance. The following morning the "sounds" were called and the dance went on, with the usual intervals, for three days. The next year, Rosaria danced for three more days as the festival of St. Paul approached; and finally, in 1959 she had danced from June 25 to 27. The team saw her during one of her choreutic performances in this period: she danced on the floor and standing, eyes open, as if absorbed in an infantile game. On the floor, she lay facedown or on her side, slightly moving her legs and pelvis to the tempo. While facedown, she was often seen cutting light-blue ribbons with scissors — that is, ribbons of the same color as the serpent which had enchanted her. Upright, she crossed the ceremonial perimeter more walking than dancing: in certain moments she placed a pillow on her head, which in the interpretation of those present was supposed to be an imitation of the enchanting serpent's large head (see photos 21-26). In Taviano, we encountered another case of the familial distribution of tarantism: Caterina and Immacolata, mother and daughter respectively, Caterina, sixty-five years old, had suffered her first bite back in 1915 — that is, forty-four years earlier — while pruning grapevines on a June morning. She suddenly fell to the ground approximately half an hour after the bite of the taranta. Since that time, every June for the last forty-four years, she had feelings of tiredness, nervousness, lack of appetite, insomnia, precordial heaviness, and in the last few years, dyspnea. According to what her daughter told us, during the critical period Caterina "fell asleep with her eyes open, without seeing anything, and spoke with the Saint" — that is, she dialogued with the hallucinatory voice of the Saint without, however, remembering anything upon "awakening." But those present, who only overheard Caterina’s part of the conversation, could reconstruct the entire dialogue. From what they told us, the Saint paid her a visit, announced his departure and set the time of his next visit; he was always punctual, so much so that the household was able to adjust the organization of domestic chores while awaiting the special visit. Often quarrels with the Saint took place, protests and negotiations regarding the times, and even — according to those present — reports about faraway and hidden things.

From time to time, Caterina got out of the bed on which she lay during the “mystical” relation and for a brief period soundlessly sketched a dance in a circle, the last remnants of the ancient musical therapy which had long been in disuse in Taviano. Caterina preserved the ideology of the taranta, and spoke of the bite which occurred forty-four years ago and which continued to renew itself each year in the same season; she also spoke of the “children” and “grandchildren” of the taranta which continued to torment her.

But by now the mystical orientation of her REMORSE IN THE DOG DAYS 63 jonship with St. Paul predominated, and the taranta appeared pushed a the margins, from time to time insinuating its own image into that : A jostle to the Gentiles. Her daughter Immacolata, age thirty-six, was os by tarantism in circumstances which clearly suggest the influence of maternal example. One June morning eight years ago, Immacolata got up to wash her son’s swaddling clothes; but as soon as she stood up, a form of igo forced her to lie down again. It seemed to her that there was an intense in in her temples; she touched the painful spot, and as she withdrew her hand saw that it was bloody. She looked at her fingers more closely and thought t she could make out the leg of a taranta stuck to one of them. f She passed out, and when she opened her eyes the sun was already high. ym that day on she began to feel stomach aches, head pains on the side of presumed bite, lack of appetite and vomiting. Immacolata said nothing o her mother about the incident of which she had been victim, and when the of the festival in Galatina came, she went along with her mother as she done for years. But as soon as she stepped into the chapel “she felt herself cazzicare” and had a crisis, of which she bore no memory. From that year on, om May until the festival of Galatina, Immacolata complained of the same ailments: tiredness, stomach ache, headache, vomiting. Additionally, in the critical season the wound at her temple reddened. She firmly believed that she had been bitten at other times in different spots, such as her arm or foot, and she showed us the signs. According to those present, the crisis imitated that of "the chapel and was similar to the maternal crisis: convulsions, dialogues aloud with the taranta and the Saint, statements as to the times of departure and the next visit, and complete obliviousness “upon reawakening. In the period from May to June (up to the festival of Galatina), she could not listen to music without being overcome with extreme weakness. In Maglie, we encountered another case in which mother and daughter were - both tarantate. In an unspecified year of her youth, the mother was stung r during the tobacco harvest and danced regularly for a few years; now she was cured. Her daughter Giovanna, age nineteen, was stung in the garden at age fourteen while absorbed in her sewing. She danced with two musicians playing tambourine and accordion. At age fifteen, she ran away with a youth, whom she then married. The seasonal crises and dances repeated even after she was married, but the last time the dance was interrupted by the carabinieri, who intervened on orders from the health officer. She was brought to the psychiatric hospital in Lecce, from which she was released after a few days. Giovanna told us that when she was allowed to perform, the crisis was released in the dance; outside of the critical season, she was well and gained weight. But since she had been prohibited from dancing, she remained ill all year long, despite the liver extracts and calcium injections the doctors had prescribed for her.

A last case which attracted our attention was that of two sisters-in-law, Anna and Peppina of Nardo. The first of the two, age thirty-four, had been “sfiatato” by a snake eight years earlier and had felt the effects of the episode of "la Sfiatatura" many days later: from the description she gave of it, the team's doctor recognized the characteristic symptoms of a liver colic with bilious vomiting. During her hospital stay, she had felt sick and vomited upon hearing music on the radio. At home, she had been cured with the sounds; since then, every year at June, her "stomach ache" returned, and she had to dance. Her relationship with St. Paul seemed to be limited to vague images of his figure seen half-asleep or with her eyes shut. Her sister-in-law Peppina, age thirty-three, was instead stung three years ago, although she did not remember the moment in which the incident had taken place. She, too, saw the Saint "with her eyes shut," entered into the critical period from May to June, and asked for "the sounds" for dancing.

The question of tarantism in non-Apulian immigrants in Apulia and Apulians who emigrated from their land is frequently treated in the earliest literature on tarantism. This question sometimes intersects with another as to whether or not the taranta is poisonous outside of Apulia, or if its bite is harmful only in this region and perhaps only among inhabitants of the place. In the manner in which it is outlined in the traditional literature, a problem of this sort is naturally senseless. But the fact that it was debated at length and finally abandoned more out of boredom and inconclusiveness than anything else can be a very instructive fact from the historical-cultural point of view.

Certainly, in the hypothesis that tarantism is reducible to a form of arachnidism, it is not important whether the poisonous spider's bite takes place in Apulia or elsewhere, harming an Apulian or non-Apulian; moreover, if the spider that bites is harmless, poisoning occurs neither in Apulia nor elsewhere, regardless of whether one is Apulian or not. But precisely because tarantism is not reducible to a form of arachnidism, and precisely because it substantially exceeds the order of facts which arachnidism circumscribes and interprets, the fact that certain incongruous questions insistently cropped back up revealed, in a certain sense, the guilty conscience of an inadequate interpretive path. Basically, these questions were the deformed echo of a possible historical-cultural interpretation of tarantism, in whose scope they acquired a precise sense. Indeed, with regard to a cultural phenomenon, it is legitimate to ask the area of its origin and diffusion; the influence it exercised on foreign individuals and groups who settled in the area; the forces leading to its growth or the potency it loses when it crosses boundaries through the exodus of its bearers or through other means of transmission. Thus, in the framework of a historical-cultural evaluation, it was entirely legitimate to ask what tarantism's connection was with Apulia, what influence it exercised on individuals or immigrant groups, what modifications it underwent, and what potency it lost when ¢arantati left Apulia. The early literature on tarantism fell into the contradiction of continuing to assert dynamics of a psychic and cultural nature, though it had chosen a naturalistic interpretive criterion in which such dynamics had no place (or at most were entirely secondary and irrelevant). Additionally, the character of the phenomenon being examined, which defied that interpretive criterion and which so often seemed to behave as if those dynamics were in action, continuously required taking into account possibilities and hypotheses which were incongruous and rendered the discourse inconclusive, given the preferred interpretive model.

REMORSE IN THE DOG DAYS

65 time limits and in part because of its local character, the June 1959 rectrontion did not obtain appreciable results. Nonetheless, two isolated observations of some interest were made. Matino told us that he had maintained his tarantism even during his military service in Northern Italy, but the information he gave was too vague for us to form an idea of what happened to him in the barracks. More significant was the eri of Tuglie, an elderly woman of seventy-three, who had left her hometown to join her sister in Tuglie — the latter, too, Sicilian and married to an Apulian. Paola had been a strong woman, so much so that she had once f ed men in a race to reap wheat. As a youth she had lived with a Sicilian baron, who died leaving her with two children and a third. With the death of her protector, Paola found herself exposed to the hostility of the baron's family; it was then that, to paraphrase her words, a "grass snake" began to torment her and forced her to leave Sicily. She came to Tuglie around thirty years ago, and the grass snake continued to torment her, but now other animals joined into the persecution — for example, dogs that terrorized her by barking from a hole in the wall. Then, in time, Paola came to readapt her experiences in the framework of tarantism: the tormenting grass snake seemed to her to move its heart to the rhythm of music, the colors began to stimulate her, she asked for cats and ribbons, and she danced in the season of the taranta: the Sicilian was by no means "converted" to Apulian tarantism.

The case of Filomena of Cerfignano had shown us how the symbolic horizon of tarantism provided not only for a dancer, singer, or libertine taranta, but also for a "sad and silent" taranta associated with states of depression. As our investigation proceeded, we realized that a depressive element always operated in tarantism, and although the rhythm of the tarantella normally dissolved this variously-manifested element, occasionally the tarantati did not appreciate the tarantella. Instead, they wanted music marked by a sorrowful nostalgia or even bemoaned their plight according to the melodic and mime patterns of traditional funeral lament. But we made yet another observation: in some cases, the symbol of tarantism did not operate at all; the sounds and colors did not evoke anything; the choreutic impulse was not released by the unfolding of musical rhythms and colored ribbons. The tarantato wandered about listless or depressed in the ceremonial perimeter as if he were seeking in vain to take part in an event which had nothing to do with him, while the band continued its sonorous treatments without success. In one of the hovels of Nardé on the morning of July 1, we attended an exorcism of this type, reduced to little more than a series of failed attempts. An eighteen-year-old fisherman was center-stage, a first-time ‘arantato; after Filomena, this was a new case of tarantism in statu nascendi. The youth, named Michele, wandered about inside the ceremonial perimeter without observing the rhythm of the tarantella in the slightest. From time to time he sketched a “dash” step, completely out of tempo, only to return immediately to his aimless roaming. Sometimes he bent over to gather the ribbons and colored rags strewn on the floor; he contemplated them for a few moments and then threw them away shaking his head disconsolately, or else he clasped them in his hands in a gesture of great desperation. He picked up the images of Saints Peter and Paul which were also strewn on the floor, gazing at their display of green, red and blue. He idolized them, kissed them, and had them kissed by those present; but then he shook his head again, disconsolate, and threw them to the ground angrily. A little bunch of wildflowers attracted his attention; he took one, brought it to his nose in the act of smelling it longingly, as if he were trying to obtain a stimulation through smell which did not come from hearing or sight — but this was another failure, accompanied by the same disconsolate mime. He asked that a friend be sent for with whom he might have been able to dance. The friend arrived shortly thereafter, and the two tried to dance together, but the attempt failed pitifully. The band did all it could in the meantime: with a swinging motion of his arms, the tambourinist strained with all his strength to emit a spray of sounds from his instrument; the barber-violinist leaned forward in an attempt to transmit the moaning sages of his violin to the recalcitrant youth — but it was all futile. At a point in the middle of the musical offering, the uncooperative youth bed, imploring: “Enough! Leave me alone! What are all these people doing here? Go away!” Then, as if speaking to himself: “I don’t feel up to it, I'm tired. I’m a strong lad, but now I’m tired.” Failure was looming on the horizon. The musicians were exhausted and discouraged, the audience showed signs of concern, and someone in the family wept softly. But after a pause, the band obstinately struck up its musical offering once more, until the recalcitrant youth, who had again taken up his desperate wandering, suddenly decided to claim himself miraculously healed; but he did it with such bad grace that it was all too clear that this was simply a way to call things off. The scene of prayers of thanks and litanies followed, to which we had already been spectators in the home of Maria of Nardo, except that in this case the miraculously-healed youth appeared annoyed by what was taking place, and from time to time he had to be hushed with gestures and called to order by those present. The final act of this exorcism gone awry was the trip to Galatina to give thanks, which had to be completed at all costs. Once again, we offered to take the tarantato to the chapel, and we did this in the company of his father and a cousin. In the car, the farantato hardly behaved like someone who had just received divine grace; in any case, he seemed scarcely convinced of the grace or of the thanks to be rendered to the Saint. The entrance to the fiefdom passed completely unobserved, and on our arrival at the chapel, the tarantato wanted to stay in the car a few more minutes to finish smoking a cigarette which he had been given during the trip. He entered the chapel and wandered about absent-mindedly, and then he went to the Mother Church to deliver the donations collected during his miserable choreutic performance. Hurriedly, he handed the coins bound in a handkerchief to a priest, and after he had washed his face at the holy water stoup, he headed back home. In the days that followed, we tried as best we could to reconstruct the biography of this tarantato and the incidents surrounding the onset of his crisis.

The tarantato in question, Michele of Nardo, was the second of six children, the last of whom was eight months old. He lived his early childhood in the midst of the difficulties of the war years (he was born in 1941), all the greater in a poor family like his. Until the age of seven, he was cared for by his maternal grandmother, who spent her days at her daughter's home, although she lived elsewhere. He went to school to no avail — he attended first grade for two years and second grade for two more, until he dropped out and was sent to apprentice in a carpenter's shop together with his brother, two years older than he. Being more talented than Michele, his brother continually reproached him for his incompetence. Often Michele did not want to go to the shop, so his older brother beat him. The apprenticeship Proved a failure, so Michele went to work in agriculture, hoeing and tending olive groves and vineyards in the vicinity of Nardo. Then his father, who owned a boat in Porto Lapillo, took him along to fish, and so Michele began to alternate day-labor in the fields with an occupation as fisherman.

In January 1959, his grandmother was left paralyzed. This profoundly shocked Michele, since his grandmother had been a mother to him in a family in which he was little appreciated due to his ineptitude, and in which his more talented older brother did not spare him thrashings in order to affirm his authority. On June 10, 1959, Michele went fishing with his father. Upon coming ashore, he did not want to go home to Nardé and instead preferred to stay in Porto Lapillo in an abandoned little house on the seashore. He was not a fearful youth; he had stayed alone in that house before and had even faced rough seas — but that night he was afraid. At a certain point his dog barked and he heard a noise of people, as if the house were besieged. He looked out the window, and though he did not see anything, he took a rifle from the wall and fired a few shots into the darkness.

The next night the siege was repeated, and this time Michele saw a crowd around the house and people waving daggers at him. This time, though, his dog had not barked. This made Michele so furious that a few days later he took the dog, tied a stone around its neck, and threw it into the sea; he then returned to Nardo. On June 25, his older brother ran away from home, stealing 11,000 lire from his parents; later it was learned that he had gone to Rome to look for work. Michele tried to console his mother, who was in tears: "Don't think about him, Mamma." But a few days later his brother returned, as often happens with these flights "to Rome" attempted by restless Salentine youths. The mother was ready to pardon him, but Michele seized the opportunity to vent old, suppressed grudges and threw himself on his brother, crying: "You came back, you wretch!" The mother intervened to defend the prodigal son, and Michele was forced to remain silent. That very afternoon — it was Sunday — Michele went to the cinema and saw a film dealing with a crime of jealousy among fishermen. Michele's distraught state after the film, his visits to the church, and his fear of being a tarantato

Michele left the theater distraught and went to the church to confess and receive Communion. He was seen by many in the act of receiving the Sacrament in church. On Monday morning, while repairing his bicycle, he felt an unusual stimulus from some dance tunes broadcast by a radio. He ate normally and made up with his brother, but he continued to feel oppressed, so much so that his father decided to take him along to the sea to distract him. While they bicycled the road to Porto Lapillo, Michele confided to his father his fear that he was a tarantato. He suggested that a misdeed committed some days earlier explained his state: chatting with friends who were planning to go to the upcoming festival in Galatina, he had blurted out in irritation that St. Paul and his festival could go to the devil. They returned from Porto Lapillo in the afternoon, and Michele wanted to be taken to the chapel in Galatina, but his state of depression continued. In the evening he asked for an accordion and began to play it, forcing his older brother and a friend to listen to him and cry while he played; in the end, the two started crying in earnest, until Michele decided to rest a while around midnight. The next morning, which was Tuesday, his family and neighbors decided to call the musicians; this was the background to the scenes we witnessed that very morning. The data gathered in this case intimated a biography punctuated by traumas and frustrations, dominated by jealousy of the older brother; in all probability, THE INOPERATIVE SYMBOL 53 jcidal tensions had also emerged (administration of the Rorschach test * indicated serious conflicts with his environment).”’ It was clear in -_— a Michele had sought to lend a horizon to his conflicts through a cabri l symbolism of tarantism, aided in this by intense pressure pate ely an a But th ration did not succeed, for reasons Bec castictoncerain. = E chals of Nard, the symbol of the taranta was not able to assert its on « of musical-choreutic-chromatic evocations and releases, in another ro who in a certain sense represents the most extreme case of the ets tack of efficacy — the traditional exorcism had given rise to a series of Be caderty, inconclusive choreutic displays with no seasonal discipline.

Giorgio had been left to himself ) “ a child and had not attended school; after the death of his father, “tee on a half-sister who did her best to help him. It was precisely this hal: oe who told us a version of events that was rich in detail, substantially exact an conscientious, as we were able to establish through subsequent verifications. In April of 1958, Giorgio used to travel the road to Santa Cesarea every day ina motortricycle to load fruits and vegetables, which he then resold in Colatone: On one of these trips, the motortricycle — driven by his cousin — killed a snake. Giorgio was very upset by this, and the following nights he began to complain "that he felt a mysterious presence on the mouth of his stomach, and that he = something enter through the window — he could not tell if it was a traditiona monacello® or perhaps even the dove of the Holy Spirit. Since the suggested remedies by the local doctor were of no avail, his half-sister decided to take him to Taranto "to a professor of sorcery [fatture]," but the professor did not achieve any better results than the doctor had. Neighbors suggested trying the "sounds," and indeed, on June 12 of that year, Giorgio danced for four days, until the marshal of the carabinieri of Galatone prohibited the dance because the collection of money which took place was not authorized. The half-sister and all present protested that the hovel was a private home, and that the offering was entirely destined to St. Paul (that is, to the chapel of Galatina), but the Marshal was unyielding, and the dance had to be suspended to the detriment of Giorgio, who said that he had not yet satisfied his stimulus.

Things were already looking bad, because it was highly irregular to have such an insatiable need to dance without the Saint deciding to come to grace. On this point, the half-sister made the following comment: "It couldn't be the monacello, a mythical, gnome-like trickster spirit in Southern Italian folklore. In many areas, it is thought to be the spirit of an unbaptized child."

The original Italian edition says Michele, but the case is clearly that of Giorgio. The error is repeated once again below.

In 1959, they attempted another course of action: they took him every day to the chapel of St. Paul, where he drank water from the miraculous well and vomited, but he continued to be ill. The half-sister donated a gold snake to the chapel to amend the probable offence to St. Paul brought about by killing the snake on the road to Santa Cesarea. The parish priest willingly accepted the gift, but had it transferred to the Mother Church for fear that someone might steal it from the chapel.

Since the Saint did not bestow the grace, they turned to a psychiatrist in Lecce who prescribed a treatment, but Giorgio did not want to have anything to do with it because "by that time, he only had faith in the Saints."

Between Christmas and New Year's Day, out of season but in a telling coincidence with the holiday period, Giorgio again wanted to dance for four days; since the marshal in Galatone would not give permission to do so, the entire group moved to Nardo. After four days of dancing with no grace forthcoming, Giorgio was no longer able to dance: he rose when the orchestra struck up the sit down again.

In March, 1959 — again out of season — the impulse to dance became irresistible, but the half-sister, who bore the expense, began to mount resistance owing to the economic difficulties which these endless dances had provoked. Giorgio began to cry and reproached his half-sister for having lost faith in St. Paul; she replied that she had not lost faith in the Saint, but while the grace arrived for others within a "normal" period of time, in his case St. Paul appeared unwilling to concede it. At any rate, the half-sister consented to another attempt. The group returned to Galatone, since this time the marshal would turn a blind eye, and Giorgio danced for eighteen days in the hovel, which was transformed for the occasion into a sort of chapel full of holy images and lit with dozens of votive candles. Giorgio was then taken to Galatina and confessed along with his half-sister. Leaving confession in the Mother Church, he threw himself at the feet of the priest, kissed them devotedly, and then announced to his half-sister: “Now I will die. It is St. Paul’s wish, because I must become a Saint.” His body stiffened in a position of prayer, and remaining stiffened he was taken away. At this point — March 24, 1959 — he was admitted to the psychiatric hospital in Lecce, from which he was released on April 17. He went to the home of his step-mother — not his half-sister’s — but his stay was brief, since he was turned out for “having made a spectacle of himself to the young ladies of the house”; and so he went back to his sister's.

At this point, his behavior became even more eccentric: he went around the town and people put on records to see him dance and sing in the street. Once he even barricaded himself in the house, scattering linens and dressing himself in an odd fashion. So he returned to the hospital on May 25, where our team's doctor went to visit him, yielding the following report for us:

“See note 4 above. The patient is long-limbed, with a thin face and regular features. He smiles shyly at the doctor, approaches nervously and anxious to make a good impression. He is polite and cautious in tone. His vocabulary is very poor, and he struggles with difficulty to choose the simplest, least abstract concepts. At times he does not understand the question, especially if they concern abstract concepts. He is oriented in time and place, and he seems resigned to his hospitalization with little interest in the idea of release. His affective state is adequate. On the whole, he does not reveal any clear pathology except for a reduction in recall memory in connection with recent electroshock therapy.

When he responds, he does so in a tone and manner which are appropriate for initial, introductory banalities. He performs the Rorschach test, free drawing and Kohs blocks. The results show that the patient was admitted for the first time on March 24, 1959, and released on April 17, then readmitted on May 25. The diagnosis is hysteria in a phrenasthenic context.

Moreover, the chart states that at the time of his first admission, the patient was staring, speaking to himself — apparently dialoguing with a hallucinatory entity that he had visions of saints, and he gave delirious performances with a religious entourage. After a few days, however, his behavior normalized, though he continued to claim that he had seen St. Paul and that he was a tarantato. Treated with electroshock therapy, he was released, but the patient was again brought to the clinic for behavioral disturbances — he went out at night singing and dancing, he had barricaded himself at home scattering linens and dressing himself in an absurd manner.

In the clinic, the patient behaved normally, oriented and well in tune with his surroundings, though somewhat puerile. He underwent another electroshock treatment, the latest dating to four days ago. His current behavior can be described as normal. Data obtained from the interview with the subject, as well as from the Rorschach test and the accounts of family members, suggest that the dissociated state presented in this case might be attributed to a schizophrenic process rather than to hysteria. Remorse in the Dog Days

The event of the "first bite" and the nature of the "re-bites" were central to one of the most delicate questions of the entire investigation. The case of Pietro of Nardo had shown that even when an episode of latrodectism had initially taken place, tarantism immediately grafted itself onto the toxic syndrome and continued to carry out its symbolic order well after the syndrome had run its course. With regard to the two episodes of "first bite" we encountered during our investigation — those of Filomena of Cerfignano and Michele of Nardò — several data argued in favor of the symbolic character of the "bite," "poison" and "crisis," with no relation to any form of arachnidism whatsoever. The same could be said for the cases of Maria of Nardé and Giorgio of Galatone.

During our investigation, indications pointing in this direction grew more and more numerous; by the end, none of us had any doubt as to the fact that latrodectism does not at all contribute to the understanding of tarantism as a cultural phenomenon, even if — in single cases — it could actually have provided the opportunity for putting the symbolic apparatus into motion, and even if —as we will see later on — it historically had an important part in conditioning the phenomenon in past centuries.

The details of the first crisis which the tarantati and their families consistently related to us substantiated the correctness of this interpretation. Pantalea of Giuggianello, age forty-one, was stung by the taranta at age eighteen, and thus had been a tarantata for twenty-three years; she had the first crisis "two weeks after her father's death," when she was still in the crisis of mourning. She began to feel "wounded," that is, weakened in her physical and psychic forces, and she shivered with cold and fever. One day, sitting "weary" on a chair — the term "weary" indicates the characteristic tedium of tarantati —a neighboring woman "gave her the signal" with a tambourine; that is, she explored her with the rhythmic percussion of the instrument which more than any other stimulates tarantati to "scazzicarsi" in dance. Pantalea responded immediately to the "signal" and danced for a night on her feet and on the floor, dialoguing with St. Paul. From then on, every year around June she would begin to feel "wounded," to the point that she fell into convulsions or was immersed in a state of inertia in which she heard all without being able to move or respond.

Moreover, in the same seasonal period, the rhythmic beat of footsteps on the wooden floor of the tobacco storehouse "wearied" her and induced her irresistibly to dance. Sixty-six-year-old Rita of Alezio, tarantata for forty years, underwent her "first bite" in the following series of events: she suffered from convulsions from the time she was a youth, and then around age thirty — already married with children — her ovaries were removed; immediately after the operation the convulsions ceased, but she was stung by the taranta.

In the month of May every year, she "became weary" and "was strong," she scazzicava on her own — without musical Es _ perhaps beating the tempo with her hands; the musicians came d to facilitate her task. During the dance she often wished to place tween the tambourine and the accordion "to catch the sound." The story of Matilde of Cutrofiano demonstrates the symbolic character of the "bites" and "re-bites" of the tarantati. Matilde, a decrepit little old lady of six years, was stung at age sixteen and had her first bite remain buried in the fog of her memories. She recalled suffering the first bite while kneeling in prayer, but also remembered a walk in the countryside in her youth and a "big, yellow" spider responsible for the events that followed. Since then, every summer Matilde was bitten and re-bitten by the spiders; she saw them, felt their sting, called them by name, and answered their call. These spiders gave her orders, such as prohibiting her from eating certain foods, forcing her to walk in a specific way, and commanding her to stay away from certain persons. Matilde had to obey their petty tyrannies, or the spiders would avenge themselves by making her feel "wounded." Matilde considered her spiders to be authentic persecutors, bonded to each other by kinship, as children or grandchildren. In her sixty years of tarantism, she encountered all types of spiders – big and small, yellow and sometimes in her food (and so she could not eat it) and once even in the host when she was on the point of receiving Communion.

As the festival of Galatina approached each year, the spiders reappeared, and she felt wounded and was stimulated to dance. While she was still young and her father was alive, the sounds for dancing were always called; but then, left an orphan and alone in the world, little by little she did away with the sounds, limiting herself to dancing and singing old rustic songs, or even religious songs, and beating the tempo on the table from time to time. After the crisis and the dance each year, Matilde traveled the few kilometers between Cutrofiano and Galatina on foot and with light step; she went to the chapel to thank the Saint who helped her combat her implacable spiders.

It is evident that events of this type, though summary, give a glimpse of the symbolic character of the "bites" and "re-bites" of the tarantati, no matter what the initial occasions might have been which put the traditional symbolism into motion. We reached the same conclusion through an analogous case, which we had the chance to analyze with particular care by way of a series of interviews with the tarantata and her family.

Eighteen-year-old Carmela of San Pietro Vernotico had suffered her "first bite" in connection with the period of her puberty. At age thirteen, in autumn – and therefore out of season – she had the first worrisome sign: all of the sudden she began to bark like a dog. But, our informants commented, since it was autumn the barking did not last long and the girl recovered. The following summer, however, the "bites" reappeared along with a string of other symptoms: stomach ache, localized pains, intolerance for certain foods and odors. When she saw these foods or noticed these odors, Carmela fled barking and went to neighboring women or to a shop, asking for hard bread and anchovies – in short, in her tastes she behaved "just like a pregnant woman."

A local doctor advised the family to obtain a zito for her, a fiancé; however, a youth who seemed a possible match soon began to have trouble with the girl's character, which was worsening despite the engagement, to the point that she walked the streets gesturing unbecomingly, emitting cries and groans. The youth confided in an old woman of Tuturano (evidently a fattuchiera [sorceress], who gave her oracular response: "If the taranta that stung her has had children, the girl will dance until the seventh generation of its descendants," The youth reported this response to Carmela's mother, who did not give it much credence; having had a tarantata sister, she was an expert in the matter and did not perceive symptoms of tarantism in her daughter's behavior. Carmela was brought to a psychiatrist in Lecce, but she began to manifest symptoms closer to traditional symbolic framework. June 20, 1956, Carmela dreamed of scorzoni and a green lawn with a youth in green suit and red cape. Carmela recognized St. Paul, who promised to help her. In her dream, a swarm of scorzoni appeared, and St. Paul reassured her that they were "holy souls of purgatory." Carmela saw a large, heavy, flat stone that split open, revealing water.

After Carmela's menarche, her family sent for a band to play various types of music. Carmela reacted to the tambourine's strikes and fainted. Her menarche transformed her into a woman, and she danced for two and a half hours. She continued to dance every summer, sometimes triggered by rhythmic sounds. Carmela's dancing often coincided with her menstrual period. Her family believed a "scorpion" was responsible. Carmela saw it as a black "scorpion" with hairy legs, protruding lips, and a coachman's hat. During the dance, Carmela spoke with St. Paul, enduring threats, and made agreements on the length and date of the next crisis. After the dance, Carmela remembered all that happened with a stiffened expression but open eyes.

Paul as a youth with a "white beard," the cement platform will split, giving a glimpse of water in the crack, and the menarche which follows). In any case, the data were sufficient to confirm the symbolic interpretation of her tarantism in general, and of her "first bite" in particular. The girl's environment was saturated with symbolic connections asserted with "great seriousness and without the slightest doubt"; the judgments of family members during our interviews gave us ample evidence of this. For example, her sister told us that perhaps the girl barked like a dog because a scorpion had stung a dog which had in turn "breathed on Carmela;" according to her father, Carmela danced in the summer because in this season the spider's web was taut and dry, and the spider could run and dance on silken threads at ease, communicating its movement to the girl; in the winter, though, the web became soft and wet and did not bear the dance of the spider, which remained immobile in the center of the web, leaving the girl in peace. For the same reason, in her mother's opinion, the tarantate never danced past one o'clock in the morning, when the nocturnal humidity softened the web. The whole family agreed in asserting that while Carmela danced, scorpions from the garden next door approached the room as if they were enchanted by the music; indeed, the last time a scorpion appeared in the room and began to dance on the floor together with Carmela. Her mother maintained that the scorpion which had stung her daughter must have been "old," "maybe a hundred years old," because her daughter often danced close to the floor; when the scorpion or faranta was young, standing figures in which the tarantata perhaps held onto a rope suspended from the ceiling facilitated her balance. Once they had put a rope up for Carmela, too, the girl did not use it, therefore the scorpion was really old. The neighborhood also participated in this atmosphere of mystical relations; two neighboring elderly people confided to us that on one evening in which Carmela received the "first grace" of St. Paul (that is, one of the graces which the Saint bestows at the end of the 60 SALENTO 1959 seasonal choreutic rounds), the figures of Saints Cosma and Damiano* loomed in the garden next door. At the same time, Carmela's family also ingenuously trusted science's potential in this field. This was demonstrated not so much by the fact that they had gone many times to the best psychiatrists in Lecce, as by the moving devotion with which they sought to help us in our research, secretly hoping that we would find the way to cure their girl and put an end to an affair which was upsetting the family finances and kept their hearts in suspense every summer. A few days after the team's return to Rome, we received a telegram which made us feel all of the responsibility of our research, reminding us in the most brutal way that the tarantati were not only documents of another age, but living persons to whom we had current obligations. The telegram read: "Carmela is dancing. Come." The cases of Pantalea of Giuggianello, Matilde of Cutrofiano and Carmela of San Pietro Vernotico were of interest not only because they highlighted the symbolism of "bites" and "re-bites," but also because they accented the "hallucinatory" character of tarantism with particular vigor. The great majority of the tarantati dialogued with an appointed voice — that of the taranta or of St. Paul (or of St. Paul-taranta or taranta-St. Paul; the distinction was not always clear). Thus, for example, Pietro of Nardé described the voice of the Saint (“Far away, low, like a voice heard over the telephone”) and his visible figure (“in full relief, normal height, with a sword, book and colors, as in the sacred images distributed at the festival of Galatina”). But the hallucinations sometimes absolved yet another function besides that of relating to the taranta and St. Paul: in the moment of crisis they anticipated “the sounds” which the tarantato ardently needed to execute the musical exorcism. One tarantata, who was not counted in the sample because at the time of our investigation she had no longer been one for several years, had the usual signs on the occasion of the initial episode: headache, depressive state, and so on. The doctor ordered her to go for a period of rest in the country, which she did. But one morning, while sitting and complaining about her headache, she saw a group of running horses, shaking bells similar to the sound of a tambourine. The jingling irresistibly induced her to rhythmically beat her foot on the floor without being able to stop. The women of the neighborhood were called, who at such a clear sign diagnosed, “It's taranta.” The tarantata asked to send for some musicians whom she had already heard other times during the many musical exorcisms she had attended as a spectator; her wish was immediately granted, and the choreutic round had an auspicious beginning.

The relative facility with which tarantism is connected to hallucinatory phenomena presented a new argument in favor of the essentially symbolic character not only of the “re-bites” but also of the vast majority of “first bites.” The tarantati and their families often mentioned initial episodes connected with real bites, but then they indicated an imaginary spot on the body to demonstrate Saints Cosma and Damiano are particularly revered in Apulia; known as the “Holy Doctors,” they are often invoked by devotees in health-related matters.

Sometimes the road shadow of a doubt that each year the spot of the fe reddened again, and they displayed the imaginary reddening as a Fecible proof. This was the case of Immacolata of Taviano, which ee ccamine shortly. Even when the tarantati and their families seemed Seriously relate the circumstances of a real bite, sooner or later clearly Sic elements were introduced into some detail of their narration: thus, for F " the bite occurred “at noon” (Maria and Pietro of Nardo, Concetta of n a, or had been inflicted by a scorpion “of all different colors” ai of Nardo).

All of this led us to consider . "extreme caution even those episodes which were apparently connected _ . real encounter with spiders (reaping, gleaning, tobacco harvest). This also gave more credibility to the interpretive hypothesis that precisely a situation : traditionally known as an objective risk (the harvest, sleeping in the = combined with the fatigue of labor in the fields, the sun, and the influence oO! traditional symbolism — unleashed the experience of the “first bite ina a “that was completely independent of actually being bitten by a poisonous spider. Whether it was the bite of a harmless spider or paresthesia, the apparatus was ‘set in ion. ; ; I c: enother direction, however, our investigation revealed the reality of _ the “first bite” as wholly secondary within the framework of tarantism. If the _ phenomenon we studied depended solely upon “real bites” of poisonous spiders, ‘then the familial distribution of tarantism we confirmed was a mystery. Out “i "seventeen families of tarantati, one presented two cases and another three cases; moreover, in another three families there were relatives who had been tarantati in the past but who were no longer so currently (the aunt of Carmela of San : Pietro Vernotico, the mother of Donato of Matino, the mother of Giovanna of Maglie). Moreover, qualitative analysis confirmed the cultural conditioning of a distribution that even in the raw numerical data was sufficient to at Log be noticed. It was in Nardo that we encountered the most demonstrative case: two sisters and a brother, tarantati in the same family. The first sister, thirty- one-year-old Cristina, had suffered her first bite at age nineteen, when she 0 been married for two years. The occasion of the bite was a purulent otitis — put the traditional symbolism of tarantism into motion. Cristina saber of being bitten while shelling fava beans. She was treated with music, wl . Stimulated her to dance seated, moving her head and an arm in rhythm on the Side of the afflicted ear until “the dirt” came out of it; she then remained well for that year. In the hot season of subsequent years, she danced eee brother Cosimo, age eighteen, was struck two years earlier: he had su ere oo Violent head pains, did not eat and slept a great deal. The doctor pene Sunstroke, and perhaps the occasion of his tarantism was just that; ut the Sunstroke, if there was one, put the usual traditional symbolism into re along with the pressure and influence of an environment already prepared to 62 SALENTO 1959 receive connections of this sort. His sister Rosaria, age thirteen, had inaugurated her tarantism three years earlier at age ten. She was going to the beach when “a light-blue snake with staring eyes” suddenly blocked her path and “cast a spell on her.” She rushed home and was seized with high fever and vomiting. A few evenings later, while eating a bit of bread, the sound of an accordion reached her ears. Rosaria threw herself on the bed, yelling that the music gave her intense stomach pains, Everyone then understood that a taranta was responsible; indeed, as soon as the accordionist was called to carry out the confirming exploration, Rosaria began to dance, The following morning the “sounds” were called and the dance went on, with the usual intervals, for three days, The next year, Rosaria danced for three more days as the festival of St. Paul approached; and finally, in 1959 she had danced from June 25 to 27. The team saw her during one of her choreutic performances in this period: she danced on the floor and standing, eyes open, as if absorbed in an infantile game. On the floor, she lay facedown or on her side, slightly moving her legs and pelvis to the tempo. While facedown, she was often seen cutting light-blue ribbons with scissors ~ that is, ribbons of the same color as the serpent which had enchanted her. Upright, she crossed the ceremonial perimeter more walking than dancing: in certain moments she placed a pillow on her head, which in the interpretation of those present was supposed to be an imitation of the enchanting serpent's large head (see photos 21-26). In Taviano, we encountered another case of the familial distribution of tarantism: Caterina and Immacolata, mother and daughter respectively, Caterina, sixty-five years old, had suffered her first bite back in 1915 — that is, forty-four years earlier — while pruning grapevines on a June morning. She suddenly fell to the ground approximately half an hour after the bite of the taranta. Since that time, every June for the last forty-four years, she had feelings of tiredness, nervousness, lack of appetite, insomnia, precordial heaviness, and in the last few years, dyspnea. According to what her daughter told us, during the critical period Caterina “fell asleep with her eyes open, without seeing anything, and spoke with the Saint”; that is, she dialogued with the hallucinatory voice of the Saint without, however, remembering anything upon “awakening.” But those present, who only overheard Caterina’s part of the conversation, could reconstruct the entire dialogue. From what they told us, the Saint paid her a visit, announced his departure and set the time of his next visit; he was always punctual, so much so that the household was able to adjust the organization of domestic chores while awaiting the special visit. Often quarrels with the Saint took place, protests and negotiations regarding the times, and even — according to those present < reports about faraway and hidden things. From time to time, Caterina got out of the bed on which she lay during the “mystical” relation and for a brief period soundlessly sketched a dance in a circle, the last remnants of the ancient musical therapy which had long been in disuse in Taviano. Caterina preserved the ideology of the taranta, and spoke of the bite which occurred forty-four years ago and which continued to renew itself each year in the same season; she also spoke of the “children” and “grandchildren” of the taranta which continued to torment her. But by now the mystical orientation of her REMORSE IN THE DOG DAYS 63 jonship with St. Paul predominated, and the taranta appeared pushed a the margins, from time to time insinuating its own image into that : A jostle to the Gentiles. Her daughter Immacolata, age thirty-six, was os by tarantism in circumstances which clearly suggest the influence of maternal example. One June morning eight years ago, Immacolata got up to wash her son’s swaddling clothes; but as soon as she stood up, a form of igo forced her to lie down again. It seemed to her that there was an intense in in her temples; she touched the painful spot, and as she withdrew her hand saw that it was bloody. She looked at her fingers more closely and thought t she could make out the leg of a taranta stuck to one of them. f She passed out, and when she opened her eyes the sun was already high. ym that day on she began to feel stomach aches, head pains on the side of presumed bite, lack of appetite and vomiting. Immacolata said nothing o her mother about the incident of which she had been victim, and when the of the festival in Galatina came, she went along with her mother as she done for years. But as soon as she stepped into the chapel “she felt herself cazzicare” and had a crisis, of which she bore no memory. From that year on, om May until the festival of Galatina, Immacolata complained of the same ailments: tiredness, stomach ache, headache, vomiting. Additionally, in the critical season the wound at her temple reddened. She firmly believed that she had been bitten at other times in different spots, such as her arm or foot, and she showed us the signs. According to those present, the crisis imitated that of "the chapel and was similar to the maternal crisis: convulsions, dialogues aloud with the taranta and the Saint, statements as to the times of departure and the next visit, and complete obliviousness “upon reawakening. In the period from May to June (up to the festival of Galatina), she could not listen to music without being overcome with extreme weakness. In Maglie, we encountered another case in which mother and daughter were - both tarantate. In an unspecified year of her youth, the mother was stung during the tobacco harvest and danced regularly for a few years; now she was cured. Her daughter Giovanna, age nineteen, was stung in the garden at age fourteen while absorbed in her sewing. She danced with two musicians playing tambourine and accordion. At age fifteen she ran away with a youth, whom she then married. The seasonal crises and dances repeated even after she was married, but the last time the dance was interrupted by the carabinieri, who intervened on orders from the health officer. She was brought to the psychiatric hospital in Lecce, from which she was released after a few days. Giovanna told Us that when she was allowed to perform, the crisis was released in the dance; Outside of the critical season she was well and gained weight. But since she had been prohibited from dancing, she remained ill all year long, despite the liver extracts and calcium injections the doctors had prescribed for her.

A last case which attracted our attention was that of two sisters-in-law, Anna and Peppina of Nardo. The first of the two, age thirty-four, had been “sfiatato by a snake” eight years earlier and had felt the effects of the episode la Sfiatatura] many days later: from the description she gave of it, the team’s doctor recognized the characteristic symptoms of a liver colic with bilious os SALENTO 1959 vomit. During her hospital stay, she had felt sick and vomited upon hearing music on the radio, At home she had been cured with the sounds; since then, every year at June her “stomach ache” returned and she had to dance. Her relationship with St. Paul seemed to be limited to vague images of his figure seen half-asleep or with her eyes shut. Her sister-in-law Peppina, age thirty. three, was instead stung three years ago, although she did not remember the moment in which the incident had taken place. She, too, saw the Saint “with her eyes shut,” entered into the critical period from May to June, and asked for “the sounds” for dancing.

The question of tarantism in non-Apulian immigrants in Apulia and Apulians who emigrated from their land is frequently treated in the earliest literature on tarantism. This question sometimes intersects with another as to whether or not the taranta is poisonous outside of Apulia, or if its bite is harmful only in this region and perhaps only among inhabitants of the place. In the manner in which it is outlined in the traditional literature, a problem of this sort is naturally senseless. But the fact that it was debated at length and finally abandoned more out of boredom and inconclusiveness than anything else can be a very instructive fact from the historical-cultural point of view. Certainly, in the hypothesis that tarantism is reducible to a form of arachnidism, it is not important whether the poisonous spider's bite takes place in Apulia or elsewhere, harming an Apulian or non-Apulian; moreover, if the spider that bites is harmless, poisoning occurs neither in Apulia nor elsewhere, regardless of whether one is Apulian or not. But precisely because tarantism is not reducible to a form of arachnidism, and precisely because it substantially exceeds the order of facts which arachnidism circumscribes and interprets, the fact that certain incongruous questions insistently cropped back up revealed, in a certain sense, the guilty conscience of an inadequate interpretive path. Basically, these questions were the deformed echo of a possible historical-cultural interpretation of tarantism, in whose scope they acquired a precise sense. Indeed, with regard to a cultural phenomenon it is legitimate to ask the area of its origin and diffusion; the influence it exercised on foreign individuals and groups who settled in the area; the forces leading to its growth or the potency it loses when it crosses boundaries through the exodus of its bearers or through other means of transmission. Thus, in the framework of a historical-cultural evaluation, it was entirely legitimate to ask what tarantism’s connection was with Apulia, what influence it exercised on individuals or immigrant groups, what modifications it underwent and what potency it lost when ¢arantati left Apulia.

The early literature on tarantism fell into the contradiction of continuing to assert dynamics of a psychic and cultural nature, though it had chosen a naturalistic interpretive criterion in which such dynamics had no place (or at most were entirely secondary and irrelevant). Additionally, the character of the phenomenon being examined, which defied that interpretive criterion and which so often seemed to behave as if those dynamics were in action, continuously required taking into account possibilities and hypotheses which were incongruous and rendered the discourse inconclusive, given the preferred interpretive model.

6 Tarantism and the Economy
As with any religious-historical phenomenon, tarantism figures into a set of precise social and economic relations, Apart from its distribution according to sex and family, which we have already mentioned, it also currently features a distribution by well-defined social classes, From a strictly economic point of view, it impacts the life of the society in various ways, appearing as debits in the family budgets of the tarantati and as credits in those of the musicians and the Chapter of Galatina. The team, therefore, had to devote attention to this aspect of the research problem, especially through the work of the member entrusted with the task of gathering the data necessary for defining such relations. With regard to the distribution of tarantism by social class, the 1959 fieldwork reached the conclusion that in its present state, the phenomenon exclusively regarded the peasant world - that is, the group of productive categories involved in agricultural work and those who more or less dedicate themselves to it at intervals. This assessment seemed to give a certain credibility to the thesis held by partisans of reduction of tarantism to a form of arachnidism, since membership in the peasant world fit in well with an increased exposure to the danger of a real man-spider encounter. However, this argument demonstrated little, especially in view of the fact that when the historical data were examined, it became clear that in the past, tarantism had always been primarily a peasant phenomenon, but other social classes were involved.

Inasmuch as it was possible to deduce from the aforementioned Dialogo delle tarantole by Dr. Vincenzo Bruni of Melfi, people who worked the land were not the only ones who participated in the tarantism of the city of Venosa in the summer of 1596. Epifanio Ferdinando related the strange episode of the Milanese bishop of Polignano, Giovan Battista Quinzato, who fell prey to tarantism and was cured with music and dance. Although Kircher considered the phenomenon as widespread mainly among peasants and shepherds (messores, hortulani, pastores),*° among the few cases he explicitly recorded, he nonetheless counted the Tarantine nobleman Roberto Santoro, two Capuchins and a Spaniard. Moreover, he reported a curious experiment in the ducal palace of Andria, which testified the extent to which the ideology of tarantism involved the local nobility in the seventeenth century.*'

Two noblewomen of Lecce were included in the five cases reported by Baglivi, and Valletta of Lucera emphasized how among the sarantati there were men “aetate, moribus, generis nobilitate, statu, dignitate fulgentes, gravissimi, serii, morigerati, alienissimi, dum incolumes erant, non tantum ab saltibus edendis, sed ab saltantibus aliis conspiciendis, qui tamen hac tabe infecti, liberissime, alacriter ed impatienter joculari manuum jactatione tripudiant, absque eo quod TARANTISM AND THE ECONOMY 67 ; jbus puerilibus et mulieribus motibus erubescant.”* The cases he reported included a priest, a monk, and a noblewoman “Juncta connubio viro huius 4 E e civitatis antistitis ex fratre nepoti.”®* Finally, in the twenty-two cases reported by Dr. Nicola Caputo of Lecce, besides a priest, there was Caputo's own wife, a certain Beatrice De Cesare. Only from the nineteenth century on, specifically with De Renzi's monograph, did the literature on tarantism record the participation of persons belonging to higher social classes. With all likelihood, this may be interpreted as proof that tarantism had ceased to involve social classes outside of the peasant world, in accordance with a process common to so many other historical-religious phenomena pushed to aduly concentrated cultural life in the cities and oriented it in a manner consistent with the city-dweller's regime of existence. The 1959 fieldwork yielded full confirmation of the recurrent servation in the traditional literature on tarantism regarding the economic difficulty provoked in families by periodically resorting to the musical exorcism. Maria of Nardo, who lived in a one-room home with no running water or bathroom and had a tubercular and often unemployed husband, paid the four musicians 12,000 lire for each day of dancing, plus board. In 1959, for two days of dancing, the expenses totaled around 30,000 lire, advanced by the owner and to be paid off with unremunerated working days. To this expense, we must add the unaccrued earnings from the lost working days during the dancing and in the period immediately following it, when Maria did not feel able to face the fatigue of working in the fields.

Pietro of Nardo, assignee of a nine-hectare farm (22.24 acres), paid the musicians 14,000 lire per day plus board, in addition to the time he did not work both during the dancing and afterward (sometimes for more than a week).

Carmela of San Pietro Vernotico, whose father was the assignee of a two-hectare vineyard (4.94 acres), cost her family 60,000 lire for three days of dancing, plus room, board, and travel expenses for the musicians, who came from Squinzano. The family had a 30,000-lira debt with the grocery and all of the money put aside for Carmela's trousseau had been spent for her dancing, taking her to Galatina and paying the doctor in Lecce.

Concetta of Cannole, wife of a sharecropper (sixty-six ares [1.63 acres]) who was also a small farmer (sixty ares [1.48 acres]) and who occasionally worked as a day-laborer and stonemason, related that after dancing, due to their age, customs, nobility, status, radiant dignity, and very authoritative, they were very indifferent to dancing as long as they were uninfected, even though others danced. When they were infected with this contagion, they danced very briskly and impatiently, with a playful agitation of the hands, without blushing for such infantile movements.

Concetta related that her marriage was related to a man, nephew on the brother's side of a priest of the city of Lucera. In 1959 and after the grace "we went asking [for money]," they were practically forced to seek alms to cope with their economic difficulties. In order to dance and go to Galatina, Concetta herself had sometimes borrowed money.

Anna of Nardo, wife of a peasant proprietor of twenty-two ares, had a debt of 30,000 lire with the musicians. And finally, because of his dancing, Giorgio of Galatone had encumbered the budget of his small-farmer brother-in-law in a significant way, as there was a debt of 400,000 lire to pay the musicians, and his brother-in-law was forced to remove his daughter from the trade-school which she had been attending successfully.

We obviously did not manage to obtain indicative data on the amount of the donations made by the tarantati to the chapel of Galatina, even only for 1959. At one time, these donations must certainly have been considerable; the report of a pastoral visit of the archbishop of Otranto in 1837 (a document to which we will return below), notes that the faithful flocked to the chapel from afar, making "magnas oblationes, ex quibus providetur necessariis tam in hac Capella, quam in Sacristia Matricis Ecclesiae," A certain indicative amount could be gleaned, even if with great caution, from the declarations of the tarantati and their families. Two dances of Giorgio of Galatone yielded 50,000 lire to the chapel and the necessary sum of money for renovating the floor. On another occasion, Giorgio’s sister donated a gold serpent to St. Paul. Pietro of Nardé collected donations for a total of 74,000 lire, duly deposited in the chapel. Even taking into account exaggeration (though the gold snake and renovated floor were visible to visitors), the donations of the tarantati and the money obtained with the collections of devout mendicants on the day of the festival in Galatina must have undoubtedly amounted to rather significant sums. In two cases, those of Maria and Michele of Nardo, we directly supervised the transfer of the entire sum collected, which was not more than a few thousand lire. In any case, the idea that the donation money might be spent for the private use of the tarantati was to be ruled out: it was entirely reserved “for the Saint,” that is, for the chapel of St. Paul.

Approximately 0.34 acres; these data for Anna of Nard6, however, contrast with those provided in Appendix 4, and it is not clear that the discrepancy can be explained as the confusion of Anna with another tarantata, since no other one fits this description.

Great offerings to provide for the necessities of both this Chapel and the Sacristy of the Mother Church, 7 Tarantism and Catholicism. There is no doubt that the tarantism which our team was able to observe in Salento during the summer of 1959 featured all the signs of a profound disintegration, especially since one of its fundamental characteristics, » musical-choreutic-chromatic exorcism, showed clear signs of wear. It was exemplary that in the case of Caterina and Immacolata of Taviano, much the ideology of the taranta had remained intact, the musical sound was never carried out because it had long since fallen into disuse. Matilde of Cutrofiano had danced with the sounds in her youth, now she merely sang something to herself without a band. Giorgio of Galatone and Giovanna of Maglie had to interrupt their dancing because of carabinieri, who acted in the first case to halt unauthorized money collection in the second case on orders by the health official. For economic reasons, 00 dancing with the sounds was no longer practiced as it once was: a tarantata of Termite, age fifty, “bitten” twelve years earlier, had danced every year except the last because, “although her blood needed it,” she was unable to pay the musicians. Analogously, perhaps for the same reason, Concetta of Cannole, age thirty-six, tarantata for twenty years, had danced for sixteen consecutive years accompanied by musicians and assistants who yelled and clapped their hands in tempo or else joined her in the dance. But in the last four summers she contented herself by dancing without musicians, doing the best she could by herself. Moreover, there was an increasing shortage of musicians willing to play with expertise and diligence throughout the strenuous musical exorcism: only the band in Nard6 led by the barber-violinist and the tambourinist offered the tarantati and their families what was needed for a proper exorcism during the critical season. Finally, the variety of music used to probe the tarantato and ascertain what music was suitable for “his” taranta (one of the aspects of tarantism which traditional literature had always mentioned) now appeared drastically narrowed. The band of Nardo itself employed an extremely limited repertory in the exploration. This impoverishment weakened the link between the crisis odes and a certain number of traditional melodies offered to the tarantato induce him to dance. During our fieldwork, we often gathered data on impromptu reactions not only to religious music but also a great variety of musical passages belonging to the current repertory of village bands, records, radio, television, and cinema. So, for example, Carmela of San Pietro Vernotico rushed out of the movie theater upon hearing Lazzarella.

Limiting ourselves momentarily to the sphere of religion, the decline of the traditional exorcism conducted through musical, choreutic, and chromatic symbols appeared connected to the relationship between the taranta and St. Catholicism. Indeed, this was an extremely confused and contradictory relationship involving the coexistence of a St. Paul as protector of tarantati, implored for the grace, a St. Paul who sent the ‘arante to punish some misdeed, and a St. Paul-taranta or taranta-St. Paul who could be exorcised with music, dance, and colors.

Finally, during the dialogues with a hallucinatory voice, either the taranta or St. Paul appeared, and was taking — that of St. Paul, protagonist, and that of the taranta which bites and re-bites ~ which unsuccessfully sought to merge in a new cultural equilibrium. The figure of the Saint, supported by the Church and its clergy, had attracted the taranta and its symbolism, imparting greater emphasis to the relationship of the Saint with the visionary aspect of tarantism, to the point of completely dropping the home musical exorcism.

The attraction in favor of St. Paul was noticeable in many of that of Caterina and Immacolata of Paul, which was promoted by the influence of at times something appeared which could be both. In short, what place seemed to have two different symbolisms of the episode of Malta, people's attention to itself, thus diverting attention away from the cases already examined (for example, Taviano), but it was reflected in an exemplary manner in the case of Donato of Matino, a sixty-three-year-old man who had been a tarantato for fifty-three years.

In the first years, Donato had regularly danced with "the sounds" of Matino, but then his relationship with St. Paul had come to dominate to the point that he spoke with the Saint "like a brother." Finally, Donato ceased dancing with "the sounds" entirely, limiting himself each year to making a spectacular entrance in the chapel of Galatina: he crawled on his back, yelling with his fists raised in the air (this was precisely one of the images in the photos taken by André Martin some years earlier).

The old peasant asserted that in these annual "dances" in the chapel, to which the ceremonial aspect of his tarantism had been reduced for some time — "instead of the poison, he now got the Saint out of his system" — since the poison of the taranta had to be considered eliminated after so many years. In other words, Donato's tarantism had been transformed into a very eccentric devotion for St. Paul expressed with "the behavior of the poisoned victim" and by transferring to the Saint the "venting" that was previously stimulated by the "poison" of the taranta.

This slow process of Salentine tarantism's disintegration had been taking place in the chapel of Galatina for approximately two centuries. Aside from the mythical antecedent of Malta, the miraculous power of the well in Galatina was connected to a local legend, presented in the following version by Dr. The first half of the 1700s, there was a House of St. Paul in Galatina, where people went to ask the Saint for his grace and drink the miraculous water. 

Nicola Caputo of Lecce in the first half of the eighteenth century: it is said among the citizens of Galatina (whose belief has no support other than the testimony of an uninterrupted tradition) that one night the apostle St. Paul, who sailed our seas after Peter's preaching, was passing by the promontory of Santa Maria of Leuca and came to Galatina incognito for fear of persecutors, with the aim of visiting neophytes. He was welcomed there and received information at the home of a devotee, which still exists. In the original, they come frate e sora, a dialect expression literally meaning "like brother and sister."

TARANTISM AND CATHOLICISM

It is called the House of St. Paul. The citizens of this town are very proud of this tradition, but the most important thing they say is that one of this religious man, St. Paul, obtained the power to heal through the merits of Jesus Christ. They performed the sign of the cross on small wounds of those who had been bitten by such animals as scorpions, vipers, and phalangids. It is said that when the descendants of St. Paul had died out, some victims of the bite of the taranta, scorpion, or viper came to the House of St. Paul. It is still visible, while the poison was still in action, and they were immediately cured after drinking the water. They went home with glad hearts and gave thanks to their benefactor. This is the tradition of the citizens of Galatina, who relate various healings of this sort.

Whether or not this is to be believed in its entirety is not for us to judge, but it is in too great a degree the faith of these citizens to maintain that it is an entirely false tale and that all of these events are to be attributed to the natural virtues of that water.

In the first half of the 1700s, there was a House of St. Paul in Galatina, where people went to ask the Saint for his grace and drink the miraculous water. Caputo also states that in the Salento, many sorcerer-healers traveled from place to place, claiming their descent from St. Paul's family, showing marks which resembled under their tongues, below their knees, or on their hands or legs. They deceived the public, selling false medicines to treat illness.

A century earlier, Giambattista Marciano spoke of tarantism, the cure for the bite of the taranta poisonous animals through spells and poems. He recorded how "even today, silly women and vagrants lie, saying that they are of the house of St. Paul." The tradition of snake charmers and healers bragging to be descendants of the Apostle who mastered the poisonous snake in Malta was widespread in Salento and throughout Southern Italy; even today, folklore provides information about so-called Sanpaolari.

In the sixteenth century, Ridinando Ponzetti, a doctor who became apostolic secretary in 1499 and bishop of Molfetta in 1527, wrote at length about these self-styled members of the "House of St. Paul" in his Libellus de venenis. One of them told the author he knew how to cure victims of the bite from afar, operating on someone who was capable of providing him with the details of the bite. He enjoined the patient not to move, made the sign of the cross on him in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, had him drink water mixed with Lemnian and pronounced a spell – in the end, this provoked vomiting and the immediate recovery of the distant patient. In any case, around the first half of the eighteenth century, there had already been a well for a long time and a House of St. Paul where the tarantati gathered. According to the precious information offered by an unpublished manuscript by the local scholar Luigi Cesari, the well and the house were part of the territory that belonged to the Chapter of Galatina, and it is likely that since then, the Chapter profited from the offerings of the tarantati who flocked to Lemnian earth (Lemnia sphragis): a clay dug from a cavern in Hephaestia on the island of Nos, held to have miraculous healing properties. In 1752, a wealthy local gentleman, Don Nicola Vignola, purchased the territory for seven hundred ducats, reserving for the Chapter the privilege of all offerings in money, votive candles, and St. Paul, which would be celebrated by priests descending from the new Owner, and if there were no descendants, by the Chapter.

Soon, there were no more priests descending from the owner, and the celebration of the Masses — was turned over to the Chapter. Then the Vignola family decided to erect the present chapel, expecting that the celebration of the Masses — that is, the income from the seven hundred ducats — would pass to the independent administration of the chapel itself. The Chapter of Galatina objected vehemently, and a dispute followed between civil and ecclesiastical jurisdictions which lasted for decades. Don Vincenzo Vignola requested and easily obtained royal consent for the opening of the chapel, but papal consent was slow in coming.

Don Vincenzo had connections and supporters and did not neglect to soften the opposition with gifts of fruit, poultry, sheep, fish, and game. He did not succeed in obtaining anything. On the contrary, to add insult to injury, the Chapter of Galatina had assigned some Oblates the task of collecting the offerings of the tarantati at the well, and it conceded the begging of alms on contract, drawing stipulated sums from the mendicants, all of this taking place on someone else's property — that of Vignola.

At a certain point, Don Vincenzo lost his patience, and in 1787, he appealed to the Council of the Royal Chamber of Santa Chiara in Naples; in the same year, he obtained an injunction from the Duke of Toritto to halt the abuses. The dispute would have lasted even longer had it not been interrupted some years later by the marriage of Felicetta Vignola to the nephew of the parish priest Salvatore Tondi, head of the Chapter. Thus, where the State had no force, the intertwining of family interests among old rivals had an effect: through the good offices of Uncle Salvatore, the chapel was consecrated in 1793, and in 1807, an additional agreement regulated the disputes regarding alms and the offerings of the tarantati with reciprocal concessions.

Besides these data taken from Cesari's unpublished manuscript, the archivist of the Archiepiscopal See of Otranto kindly furnished the following excerpt from a report of a pastoral visit of Archbishop Vincenzo Andrea Grande in October, 1837:

Cappella S. Pauli Ap. de patronatu Capituli sumptis D. Fortunati Tondi subtus suum Palatium a Fundamentis reaedificata. Supra portam ex interiori parte extat tribuna, ad audiendum Sacrum, ad quam patet aditus e domibus superioribus Palatii. Habet unum Altare, in quo est imago S.

In Sacristia extat puteus, cuius aquam bibentes, qui viperarum, aliorumque, animalium veneno sunt affecti, adhibitis precibus, statim a Deo, meritis B.

Chapel of the Apostle Saint Paul under the patronage of the Chapter, rebuilt from its foundation at the expense of Don Fortunato Tondo below his mansion. Over the door on the inside there is a gallery for following the religious ceremonies, to which an access opens from the upper rooms of the mansion.

[The Chapel] has a single altar upon which there is an image of St. and so forth, upon the condition that the seven hundred ducats be used for Masses in honor of _ and although TARANTISM AND CATHOLICISM 2B i ists today, with its gallery, the painting of St. — a eee : eee suiting nn the niche with the statue lel TF rctecied by fat iron grating to shelter it from the aggressiveness =o —_

From what we were told by the local clergy, however, the niche oat e in the chapel dated to a more recent period, when the disturbance Sais tarantati during religious functions led to the transfer of the statue once location in the Mother Church to the chapel. In the report of oe visit of 1837, the doctrinal justification for welcoming the tarantati : sphere of St. Paul's cult was limited to taking note of the popular Ce e je - miraculous virtues of the well's water for the real bite of poisonous i clarifying how such a belief must in any case be viewed as a cores 4 e mrorked by God, thanks to the Apostle and the prayers of the faith ul an clergy.

A different and more elaborate attempt at doctrinaire Justification = in a Latin hymn to St. Paul, of recent origin, in which the bite : phalangid or viper became an opportunity to remember the ‘lige mbolic order of Christianity: Christ as liberator of humanity from een n and Paul as an apostle of this liberation among the Gentiles. The fo! heed ain was repeated in the hymn: Oremus ut fideliter / qui Galatinae sumpseri tuam aquam sit innoxius | Morsu phalangi et viperae.* In the other oe wever, the realistic meaning of this bite gave way to a symbolic siarmey ~ “ancient serpent” which Christ had defeated, and which the Apostle to t e Gentiles had once again dominated in the episode of Malta: ++ Caecus ee mmorans | Es tu potitus lumine | Sic nos videre perfice | Serpentis antiqui o nal emus ut fideliter, etc. ... Ut ad Melitam naufragus | Cives ferarum is “hs Fidem Fovens nos libera | A criminis contagio | Oremus ut fideliter, ete: isa .

It was up to our investigation to evaluate whether or not this attempt e absorb the tarantati in a Christian symbolism had actually succeeded beyond the in hymn. With this aim we had to observe what occurred in the Saint's chapel on the afternoon of June 28 and on the morning of June 29 in 1959. The team \ itnessed the scene in the chapel hidden in the gallery ad audiendum Sacrum _ mentioned in the report of the pastoral visit of 1837 —a sin ees was ‘hecessary in order to prevent the observers to the greatest extent possible a disturbing the phenomenon under observation.

From time to time they seemed to briefly attempt to break into songs which were sometimes times melancholy, rhythms of tarantellas and funeral dirges. on the waves of a tempestuous ocean, and then they lost their grip, quickly sunk again by the imminent crisis, The scenes which we saw from above in our gallery ad audiendum Sacrum gave us the impression of colored chips of a shattered kaleidoscope, one that was no longer capable of composing geometric designs as before: states of abandon on the floor, uncontrolled psychomotor agitation, attitudes of anxious depression, bursts of aggressive frenzy along with hysterical arches, slow crawling in a prone position, sketches of dance Steps, attempts at prayer, song and retching. Everything which we had already been able to see during the home exorcisms was repeated, but with no dynamic bond or teleological framework, as with a demolished building where one finds the exact same things which furnished the rooms when the building was still standing. This desperate agitation was dominated by the stylized cry of the tarantati, “the crisis cry,” a variously-modulated ah-cee [a.i:], which could be better described as a whine than as a human cry. The tarantati asked ardently for grace before the statue of the Saint in its niche or in the presence of a painting above the altar which depicted him with the serpent, recalling the episode of Malta; they rolled on the ground traveling the space between one image and the other; they mounted the Eucharistic table to draw nearer to the painting; they struck the iron grating which protected the statue’s niche with their fists or their shoulders; they asked for water from the miraculous well, and they ‘The recollection of team member Amalia Signorelli differs on this point: she writes that the almost exclusively female tarantate did not tolerate the presence of men in their midst; she, the social worker and another female member of the team observed the events in the Chapel by mingling among the tarantate (Amalia Signorelli [1986] “Lo storico etnografo. Ernesto De Martino nella ricerca sul campo,” La Ricerca Folklorica 13, p. 

9) just the amount of time necessary to frame and photograph some salient scene. The Social the bedlam, mingling with the arantati and their families to gather data which were impossible to the vast majority were women — gradually assembled, their crises having a simultaneous onset in the restricted space of the chapel.

But now, before our eyes, there was only an and chaos. The chapel] lacked the music, the colored ribbons, the engrossed atmosphere of the home and the wide range of symbolism put into motion by the on-going musical exorcism: in the absence of this traditional apparatus of evocation and release, sketch a dance step, clapping the rhythm with their hands or even their barefoot soles, or they | gay and at other But it was as if they were clinging for a few moments to the debris of a shipwreck surfacing TARANTISM AND CATHOLICISM 75 i i r urinated.

From the record of June 28, edited on the basis of observations conducted from 4:40pm to 8:40pm: Caterina and Immacolata of Taviano (4:40pm-8:30pm). The first image which strikes us at the initial moment of observation is that of a woman seated on top of the altar's tabernacle, nearly leaning against the painting that depicts St, Paul with the snake. Dressed in white, her gray hair loose as in the mourning of funeral lamentresses, the seated woman props a foot on the altar’s cornice, leaving the other foot hanging in the air, or else placing it on a lower cornice, elbow on her knee, her chin in the palm of her hand. Her pose recalls both a state of anxious depression and an accumulated and threatening internal tension ready to unleash itself in aggressive drives at the slightest stimulus. This is Caterina of Taviano (cf. pp. 62 ff.). Her daughter Immacolata is also in the chapel, and she, too, is dressed in white. She is supine, first immobile, then increasingly filled with a disorderly agitation which makes her move her head to and fro, thumping her buttocks on the floor. Then she begins to crawl slowly like a worm, drawing a type of circle; but quite soon she stops, panting, emitting a hoarse groan from her half-open mouth, Crawling in this way she first arrives near the altar, then in front of the niche containing the statue of St. Paul, and she begins to rain blows upon the Protective wooden door with a quickening rhythm, so that the whole chapel resonates with it like a roar. Having noticed some antagonistic color in the throng of curious onlookers, she suddenly jumps up and tries to dash to the chapel’s entrance. She writhes briefly in the arms of those who try to hold her back, and then she calms down. As soon as their grip loosens, Immacolata takes advantage of the opportunity to begin a rhythmic movement around the chapel with one arm hanging to her side and the other in front of her bent ina right angle, and she claws with her hand as if she were grasping something fleeing through the air. She approaches the altar and exchanges some gestures with her mother, who has risen to her feet on top of the tabernacle; she completes another few rounds, motions as if to make another dash to the chapel’s entrance, and finally falls to the ground with her eyes shut, remaining completely motionless. The choreutic cycle of Maria of Nard is recognizable, though altered by the absence of the discipline provided by the musical rhythm. After a few minutes of immobility with her eyes shut, Immacolata opens her eyes and seems to follow what is going on around her, at least to a certain extent. After about twenty minutes, she gets up and approaches the altar; she seems calm. Then she moves through the chapel again, hopping, and reaches the niche. At that moment, her mother raises herself up on top of the tabernacle, yelling, and she jumps onto the Eucharistic table with her finger pointing toward the entrance. She has seen a journalist friend of ours whose tie has a design which resembles a swarm of heraldic scorpions. The mother’s anger is passed on to her daughter, who jumps fiercely to the door and chases the journalist. The journalist is a short Jew from Vienna, about fifty years old; his narrow escape from this unforeseen persecution suggests a keen comparison with persecutions he suffered as a Jew in Vienna, when other, much less innocent tarantati disliked him for the profile of his nose rather than for the color of his tie.

In the meantime, the chapel is in turmoil. Immacolata is caught and the police order that the door to the chapel be closed. Then Amalia Signorelli offers an alternative interpretation of this episode: the tarantate did not chase the journalist off because of his tie, but because they particularly distrusted this category of onlookers after the publication the previous year of a tabloid-style piece on the tarantate (Signorelli 1986: 9; see note f above). TARANTISM AND CATHOLICISM T | subsides, and Immacolata resumes her skipping rounds; she shows signs of col [Original Text]

Then she requests “water, water!”, and someone brings her some in a carafe. She seems to calm down, but shortly thereafter she resumes her lament, striking the ground with a palm and then with a fist in light, rhythmic blows, as if to accompany the tempo of a tarantella ringing in her ears or perhaps simply to satisfy a hunger for rhythm. Her family says that she has a “tempestuous taranta” which drives its victim to rampage. Indeed, she rises from the ground to hurl herself against the niche, banging against the protective door with her fists, and the chapel is filled with the usual roar which mixes with the shrill ah-eee of her strident voice. She quickly rolls to the opposite wall, gets on all fours and crawls behind the altar into the sacristy to urinate in a corner (cf. p. 65).

Donato of Matino (6:05pm-6:50pm) He arrives at the door to the chapel in a one-horse carriage, accompanied by a relative. As soon as he reaches the threshold, he takes off his jacket and shoes and throws himself prone to the ground with his arms stretched above his head; in this position he begins to crawl towards the altar, from time to time letting out a loud “crisis cry.” Having crossed a short distance face-down, he turns himself over supine, stretching his arms in a cross, and he continues to crawl. His movement, so slow that it recalls that of an earthworm, is interrupted from time to time for several seconds and is then resumed. Having reached the altar, he gets up and jumps onto the Eucharistic table with the help of Caterina of R. who is still on top of the tabernacle; he climbs on a corbel of the altar where, standing, he tries to reach out to the effigy of St. Paul. He lowers himself onto the Eucharistic table, climbs onto another corbel and repeats his gesture, while Caterina of Taviano, who was also standing on the Eucharistic table, discreetly steps aside to help the frightful old man carry out his mystical acrobatics with greater ease. Donato subsequently scrambles down from the altar and resumes the supine position with his arms in a cross, and crawling on his back he begins to move towards the niche. He takes about twenty minutes to cross this distance of only a few meters because he remains motionless for long intervals, sculpting in his image of the crucifix; during one of these pauses the rolling body of Immacolata of Taviano knocks into him. While he is moving his body passes among the tarantate, standing or on the floor, bumping into them or being bumped; yet this half-earthworm, half-crucifix proceeds slowly but relentlessly toward his destination, every now and again howling his ah-eee like a dying dog. For a few minutes the frightful old man remains supine and motionless in front of the niche; then he gets up, self-assuredly sits on a bench against the wall, puts his jacket and shoes back on, and leaves the chapel along with his relatives without taking notice of anything else. His spectacular performance is over (cf. p. 70).

From the records of June 29, on the basis of observations around 11:00am: conducted from 7:15am to Some attempts to initiate collective dances were noted on the morning of June 29, Pantalea of Giuggianello (cf. p. 56) sought to lead the dances, clapping her hands in tempo, but it is all too clear that the lack of music led to a rapid collapse of the attempt; the languishing of the rhythm and dance was followed by the tarantati falling swiftly to the ground. The dances were followed by prayers and litanies led by the tambourinist of Nardd. 

Otherwise, the usual "behavior of the poisoned victim" observed the previous afternoon was repeated. We saw Maria, the sisters-in-law Anna and Peppina, Cosimo with his sisters Cristina and Rosaria, and Matilde of Cutrofiano. Kneeling in the middle of the chapel, Carmela of San Pietro Vernotico (cf. p. 57 ff.) wore a blazing red dress which imitated the Saint's cape in the sacred images; she invoked St. Paul of the tarantate at length, interspersing her invocations with sobs and a strange "barking" which could be rendered as oh-vo, oh-vo, repeated indefinitely. Some of the individual displays outside the chapel were rather significant. A tarantata from Ruffiano went out into the street and suddenly fell to the ground, rolling at the feet of the crowd. And like jugglers who pass through the audience collecting donations after a rousing number, the tarantata of Ruffiano did not fail to collect money "for the Saint" after her number, duly depositing it in the "donations box." At a certain point another tarantata appeared at the door of the chapel; she looked defiantly at the spectators thronging in the street and motioned to them to make way, and the audience complied docilely. The tarantata passed through the divided ranks with a haughty look, moving slowly and solemnly and looking at the people in the eyes, just like a high official passing to review the troops." As fate would have it, we witnessed still another episode in the death throes of tarantism in the Chapel of St. Paul: the closure of the well on the order of the mayor, who acted on a report by the sanitation officer. As we have stated, the well of St. Paul had played an important part in the Catholic attempt to absorb tarantism; for centuries, the tarantati flocked there, and the chapel had been built in such a way that the sacristy enclosed the mouth of the well, in whose water people saw "St. Paul's animals" swarm: serpents, scorpions, Scorzoni, tarante, and other insidious animals that creep on the ground, bite and poison. Those who drank the water vomited the poison and recovered. But in June 1959, the sanitation authority of Galatina had argued that the water was jraculous, but quite the contrary: dangerous, filthy, contaminated water. Not long after, the mayor issued the following ordinance, which was posted on the sealed well:

"In accordance with ordinance n. 18, protocol n. 7046 City of Galatina (Lecce) order the following: in light of the report of Dr. Santo De Paolis, municipal sanitation officer, dated June 5 of this year, protocol number 169, which notes that given the alteration in color, the water of the well enclosed in the church of St. Paul in Corso Garibaldi must be considered contaminated; and with the aim of preventing use being made of the aforementioned during the upcoming festival, it is urgent and indispensable that the well in question be closed in such a way as to impede the drawing of the water. In light of Article 55 of the municipal and provincial Law approved March 3, 1934, n. 383; and in light of Article 106 of the same law of the same province, modified by article 9 of the law of June 9, 1947, n. 530; given the urgency of the situation, Parish Priest Monsignor Salvatore Podo is to provide for the immediate closure of the aforementioned well with sturdy masonry. In the event of non-compliance, the respective work will be carried out by official appointment, with expenses coercively collected, apart from fines and all other legal consequences. The chief of the local police and the sanitation officer are responsible for the execution of this ordinance. Galatina, June 7, 1959. Signed: the Mayor B.C.

The tarantati reached the sacristy in their white garb, stopping astonished in front of the bricked-up well, the sepulcher which denied their lips the miraculous and denied their eyes “St. Paul’s animals” which were teeming in there. They then went away to vanish into the turmoil of the chapel, restless shadows vanishing from the kingdom of the dead. This “kingdom of the dead” was in reality the past to which they were miserably thrust back by a very prosaic ordinance by the mayor of Galatina; but the pity of the historian could not let them be swallowed up by the whirlpool of past centuries without having attempted to restore their palpable flesh and the dignity of their lives in the only way a historian can — through the recollection of the past.

The ethnographic investigation had obtained some appreciable results: tarantism appeared to be a culturally conditioned mythical-ritual symbol, as a horizon of evocation and release for unresolved conflicts operating in the unconscious, as a cultural framework equipped with its own autonomy with regard to the occasions and existential conditions which sustained it. Specifically, the real bite of a poisonous "arachnid during the harvest of the fruits of summer must have represented an important existential conditioning of the symbol in a more or less distant past in history.

The analysis had evidenced a series of indices which testified to this autonomy — local immunity, the annual repetition of the crisis-exorcism connection, the predominant female participation, the familial distribution, incidence of the crisis during puberty, and the varied symbolism which was connected to the episode of the “first bite.” The analysis had also highlighted how tarantism had been profoundly disarticulated and weakened as a cultural phenomenon, partly because of the Catholic influence and partly because of changed social and economic conditions. This was demonstrated by its current limited geographic diffusion, the relatively scarce number of tarantati, and the decadence of the musical exorcism and the scenes in the chapel.

On the other hand, the ethnographic fieldwork did not have sufficient means to ascertain in depth the elements of the myth-ritual nexus which had lapsed with time and were thus no longer ethnographically observable. Even utilizing the memories of the oldest informants, the historical probe employable in the field could not go beyond a half-century interval for a phenomenon for which the diachronic span extended over a period of some years. From these three documents, we derived the following diachronic information: The team doctor's report is presented in an appendix to this volume (Appendix 1). See Atti, 29, 1-10.

The well, as we shall see, was bricked up during those very days upon an ordinance from the Mayor of Galatina. However, there was another mouth of the same well in the courtyard adjacent to the chapel, and though it was covered as best as possible with boards and stones, a bit of it was still possible to draw the forbidden water.

8 The Ritual Setting and its Objects

The earliest literature on tarantism offers us precious data on what was once the phenomenon's ritual setting, data which have now been lost to ethnographic investigation. From a description that dates back to the first half of the eighteenth century, we learn that the choreutic-musical-chromatic exorcism could be held at home or outdoors, in either case with the ceremonial observance of all distinct particulars and sometimes even the artificial preparation of the surroundings in the manner of a real "sacred space."

Here is a description by la Caputo, a doctor and scholar from Lecce:

They customarily adorn the bedroom dedicated to the dance of the tarantati with verdant branches outfitted with numerous ribbons and silken sashes in gaudy colors. They place similar drapery throughout the room; sometimes they prepare a sort of cauldron or tub full of water, decorated with vine leaves and green fronds from other trees; or they make fountains of limpid water spout, capable of lifting the spirits, and it is near these that the tarantati perform the dance, seeming to draw the greatest delight from them, as if the rest of the setting. They contemplate the drapes, the fronds, and the artificial fountains, and they wet their hands and heads at the fountain. They also remove damp vine leaves from the cauldron and strew them all over their bodies, or - when the vessel is large enough - they plunge themselves inside, and in this way they can more easily bear the fatigue of the dance.

It often happens that those who go dancing through 'the towns and hamlets accompanied by the usual music are brought to an orchard, where, 'in the shade of a tree, near a pond or brook offered by nature or prepared through craft, they abandon themselves to the dance with the greatest delight, while groups of youths in search of pleasure and pranks gather near. Among the latter mingle more than a few who are approaching old age and who, contemplating with serious curiosity the melodic Trolicking, seem to exhort the youths with unspoken admonishment.

Caputo's description, despite its Arcadian distortion, is substantially correct, as its details can be confirmed on the basis of what has been attested in other prose by authors of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. In his De copia latini sermonis, the scholar Q.M. Corrado recalls the tarantati ad aquam, ad fontes, ad ramum viridem, ad umbras, ad ena omnia rapiuntur; Epifanio Ferdinando makes explicit reference to indoor celebrations: "others rejoice in the towns, outside the walls, in the fields, in public squares, some for a single day, others for two, three, four, five, or for a week, and still others for two weeks."

Father Atanasio Kircher, mentioned above, elaborated his interpretation of tarantism utilizing information from Father Nicolello and Father Galliberto, states that basins full of water adorned with grass and verdant branches were often placed on the altar to attract the afflicted, who were drawn to water, to springs, to a green branch, to all pleasant things. The Land of Remorse

Site dedicated to the dance; the tarantati drew great delight from the water and the fronds, to the point of plunging themselves into the basins and splashing about in them like ducks. The Celestine monk Ludovico Valletta lived at length in the monastery of Lucera and traveled throughout the Tavoliere to observe tarantati. His De Phalangio Apulo, published in Naples in 1706, confirms that at times the tarantati rejoiced “at the sight of limpid waters, of artificial springs that flowed with a soft murmur into a tub prepared for this purpose,” gratifying themselves with the green fronds freshly picked from the trees and strewn here and there in the space dedicated to the dance “in order to somehow represent a forest.” In another passage, Valletta resumes illustrating the ritual setting of tarantism, hinting at the troubles and substantial costs that the tarantati and their families incurred in order to pay the musicians and to prepare all that was necessary for performing the exorcism:

[The families of the tarantati] hire the musicians, to whom many gifts are given and a great deal of drink is offered in addition to the daily compensation agreed upon, so that they may take some refreshment and thus play the musical instruments with greater vigor. It follows that a man of modest conditions, who laboriously earns a living with the diligent fatigue of his arms, in order to be cured of this illness is often forced to pawn or sell objects of fundamental necessity, even if his household furnishings are shabby, in order to pay the aforementioned payment. It must be considered that no one would want to expose himself to this misfortune if he could combat the Poison in another manner, or if he did not feel compelled to dance from the bottom of his heart.

| will spare the details of the many other aids and expedients the poison victims use to raise and cheer their melancholy spirits during the dance, items also needed for one reason or another. For example, there are artificial springs of limpid water constructed in such a way that the water is gathered and always returns to flow anew; these springs are covered and surrounded by green fronds, flowers and trees. Further, lasses dressed in sumptuous wedding gowns have the task of dancing with the tarantati, festively singing and playing the same melody with them during the dance; then there are the arms and the multicolor drapery hung on the walls. All of these things, and many others, cannot be procured without payment.®

Even the Dalmatian physician Giorgio Baglivi — the author who, together with Epifanio Ferdinando, is considered the classic writer on Apulian tarantism ~ does not neglect to mention the vine leaves and leafy branches which the tarantati shook and submerged in the water in order to then adorn their heads; _ he also mentions the recurrent gesture of bathing their hands and heads, He does not speak of a tub or basin prepared in the center of the place, but instead, a hole full of water dug in the ground where — unlike Kircher's image of flapping ducks — the plunging of the tarantati makes Baglivi think of pigs rolling about in the mud. Other ritual objects noted by Baglivi are swords and mirrors; the swords for the combat represented during the dance, and the mirror in which the tarantati contemplated themselves from time to time, drawing profound sighs from their chests.'

Epifanio Ferdinando mentions another particular:

Ing (pensilem in cunam moveri cupiunt)', a detail confirmed by Baglivi5 Be eclem amant*). In this regard, Kircher states that “some tarantati ae sive hang from the trees by ropes, showing great enjoyment at such eon” and that “those stricken with this passion were above all those who pitten by tarantulas in the habit of hanging the strings of their webs from 10

This observation connects the swing as a practice used in tarantism with a circular symbolic aspect, that is, to the imitation of the behavior of the tarantula, and thus to hanging by the threads of a web to let oneself swing in the wind and so forth. Clearly, the use of the swing is linked to the outdoor exorcism with trees and springs at hand; in the home exorcism, an attempt was made to simulate the arboreal and aquatic scenery, and the swing was transformed into a rope hanging from the ceiling upon which the tarantati supported themselves, luring the dance:

| rd to the astonishing and complex agitation of the entire body, not long ago | a aay saw a woman stricken [with the poison], who, although prey to the delirium of a violent fever, and her mind possessed with horrible phantasms — or rather, she was assaulted by a whole host of insolent demons — at the sound of the musical instruments she nonetheless abandoned herself to a dance that was so excited, to such a frenetic agitation of her limbs and whirling of her head, that my own head and eyes, enthralled by the same agitation, suffered from dizziness. This woman had suspended a rope from the ceiling of her humble dwelling, the end of which, just touching the floor in the middle of the room, she tenaciously squeezed between her hands; throwing herself upon it, she abandoned herself with the weight of her whole body, her feet planted on the floor, turning her head to and fro, her face glowing, with a surly look. | was deeply astonished, not being able to explain why the dizziness provoked by that rapid and violent head shaking did not make her reel and fall to the ground. Due to this agitation and the incredible exertion borne, the woman's whole body and above all her face were covered with abundant perspiration; reddened by such strenuous agitation, she ran gasping to a great tub full of water prepared at her request, and she completely submerged her head in it, whence the cold water gave her some relief from the heat with which she blazed.

Nicola Caputo, a doctor from Lecce, describes the case of a certain Marianna “Madaro, stung July 10, 1728 “at noon” (note the customary symbolism of the hour which we were able to observe so often throughout our ethnographic investigation). Caputo reports that the tarantata had performed the dance holding onto a rope fastened to the ceiling, according to the custom practiced by all tarantati (ut hic mos est omnibus tarantatis), engaging herself with so much fervor in her choreutic performance that she broke the rope and sprained herself in the fall.!2

From the final years of the last century to the first decade of our own, Baron Francesco De Raho, a physician in Lecce, was still able to observe the peculiar usage of supporting oneself during the dance with a rope hanging from the ceiling. The photographs which accompany De Raho’s Monograph show a rope with a double end upon which the tarantata hung, at times dancing in a circle according to the radius of the rope, at times squatting as if she could no longer remain standing, and finally — the choreutic cycle they wish to be rocked in a hanging cradle. they love swinging. 90 THE LAND OF REMORSE having been completed — abandoning her grip and falling to the ground.!3 Thus the rope serves the practical function of facilitating the transition to an erect position and of avoiding wandering beyond the ceremonial perimeter, but it is also necessary to keep in mind the symbolic meaning of the spider hanging by a thread from its web and swinging in the wind, in keeping with the ideology mentioned by Kircher. While there is still memory of it here and there in the Salento, the ritual detail of the Tope was not observed in the ethnographic fieldwork, but we were told that during the dance some tarantati raised their arms in a gesture of supporting themselves upon an imaginary rope, precisely as if it represented the spider swinging in the air, hung by the thread of its web, in a mimicked dream. Besides the multicolor ribbons, the swords, the mirrors, the swing and the Tope, the musical exorcism of tarantism also used ritual objects which served as dress for the tarantato and which were made available to him around the ceremonial perimeter: [The tarantati] want ribbons, chains, precious garments, and when they are brought they receive them with inexplicable Joy, and with great reverence they thank the person who brought them. All of the aforementioned items are placed in an orderly fashion along the pen where the dancers make use of one or another from time to time, according to the impulses the attack gives them. This description from the late seventeenth century agrees unfailingly with what was still observable in the rural zones of Taranto around 1931: All of the wives offer - understood as loaned ~ handkerchiefs, shawls, scarves, and linens of every color, pots of basil, lemon verbena, mint and rue, and last but not least a great tub full of water. The surroundings are di and when everything is ready the victim of the bite, dressed in gaudy colors, chooses as she pleases ribbons, handkerchiefs and shoes that remind her of the colors of the tarantula, and she adorns herself with them while waiting for the musicians.5 petticoats, mirrors and baubles, lecorated in this way, The pots of basil, lemon verbena, mint and rue were used during the exorcism as olfactory stimuli: the tarantata smelled these aromatic plants'* from time to time in the same way that she contemplated the colors of the drapes and ribbons, or the way she drew up to one instrument or a: particular relationship with it. In other words, the evocation did not take place solely through sounds and colors, but even scents could play a part, albeit a minor one judging from the fact that this detail of the ritual finds no other confirmation in the historical documentation. However, during the ethnographic investigation we once had the opportunity to observe — in the case of Michele of Nard — how the tarantato occasionally smelled some wild flowers during the musical exorcism, precisely as if he sought to draw from the olfactory stimulus what he did not succeed in obtaining from the music and colors,.” 9 The Choreutic-Musical Symbolism ors! uli curantur sono, sa Ci c 5 scholar /tu, cantu, coloribus,* notes the Demorst App: Ui tur Ss , Si S : h Gaudenzio Merula of Novara in his Memorabilia, whose first edition bears the date of 1546.'* With music, dance, song, and colors: but above all music, which dominates the entire symbolic span of tarantism in action. a lapiaee i inni i ic; before it, there is only the crisis, ritual proper has its beginning with music; , : jth Pally conditioned imitation of the behavior of the sea aac ape imitation is —asi jority of cases — completely independent 9 an imitation is —as in the majori' col t 1 oo syndrome, or is instead grafted upon an initial episode of soa 9 din i bolism even when the toxic syndrome, or is instead grafted upon an initial episode of soa 9 din i bolism even when the______ In the framework of sym! c i nt ihe hey feel “shattered,” “smashed,” “shredded,” “broken,” as we so often heard throughout our fieldwork — 'wounde a ‘we E ‘stricken with a deep tediousness with themselves and their surroundings.

These dan e 92 THE LAND OF REMORSE evening, when they go to bed once again, stimulate their perspiration, repeat the light meal, and finally fall asleep. These dances usually continue for four days; rarely do they go beyond the sixth day: It is uncertain when the end will occur, since many continue to dance until they feel free of the symptoms, which usually takes place after the third or fourth day. Around the end of the fifteenth century or in the first two decades of the sixteenth century, the Neapolitan scholar Alessandro D’Alessandro traveled through the Lands and Hamlets of Apulia at the height of summer’s burning heat. In one specific case, he was able to observe the efficacy of music upon the tarantati in crisis: We have seen those bitten by the taranta or phalangid, called tarantati by the common people, cured of this equivocal illness in the following way: the bagpiper or zitherist® plays different motives for them according to the nature of the poison, in sucha way that with the victims entranced by the harmony and fascinated by what they hear, the poison either dissolves inside the body and dissipates, or else is slowly eliminated through the veins, The illness is so serious that the bite victims who are not helped immediately suffer lethal stupor, followed by certain death; or, if they escape death, they lead a miserable and infirm life as lunatics or half-alive, afflicted by a constant stupor and by dulled senses of hearing and sight. For this pestilence, for such an oppressive disease, the sole health-giving remedy found has been for the zitherist or bagpiper to play different melodies. Indeed, the victim is like a dead person, has lost his power of speech and sight, and cannot walk or make use of any of his senses; but as soon as he hears the sound of the bagpipes or zither up close, entranced and enticed by that sweet harmony, he awakens as if from a deep sleep, opens his eyes a little and immediately rises to his feet. Coming to, he begins to take his first steps, little by little, according to the rhythm of the music; if the rhythm presses more quickly, as though his spirits are enticed and confirmed, he breaks out with great strength in jumps and gestures that are not unseemly and disorderly, but rather in keeping with what the zither is playing...

Remember how once, when we traveled with some friends through the squalid, sun-parched plains of Apulia, throughout the lands and hamlets, we saw players of kettledrum or flute, and even more often bagpipers going around playing. Having asked the cause of this, the answer we received was that in these lands, these were the means used to cure the tarantati. Driven by curiosity, we headed for a village, and there we found an adolescent tarantato who, seized by a sudden frenzy, went about like a madman yet danced with a certain elegance, with the movements of his body and mime in keeping with the rhythm of the tambourine. It was as if that rhythm softened his soul and soothed his pain, and in order to receive it with greater vigor, he slowly and calmly lent an ear to the tambourine; all at once he began to shake his head, hands and feet and broke out in dance. Since the whole thing seemed suited to laughter and play, the one who struck the tambourine interrupted his playing in the nick of time. As soon as the sound ceased, we saw that the tarantato was astonished and stupefied, and then he lost consciousness and fell to the ground senseless. But as soon as the tarantato heard the tambourine player resume the instrument, he regained his strength, and we saw him rise to his feet with a greater vigor and abandon himself to the dance.

In Stefano Storace's 1753 report for The Gentleman's Magazine, he relates the story of a tarantato from Torre Maggio, where Storace himself played the healing tarantella. As narrated, the episode provides an excellent demonstration of the relationship between the crisis and its musical resolution: on that day, the parish priest—who was found ill on the public road, and since the parish was called to play violin for the tarantati—was far from his home. When I reached the place where distinguished persons were playing the tarantato, I found a man lying on the ground who seemed to be having his last breath. The people began to cry: "Play, play the tarantella!" (which is the air that is in eid). But I had never heard this air, and therefore I could not play it. I asked what sort of melody it was, and the reply was that it was a type of _ i ia ed various jigs, but to no avail, because the man remained immobile. The people continued to ask for the tarantella, and I said that I would learn it immediately. An old lady offered to help, and someone sang it for me, and I would learn it immediately. Another woman came forward and helped me to learn the piece, as soon as the first minutes...

It so happened that while I was learning the rhythm of the tarantella, the man began to move, as quick as a lightening bolt, with a terrifying vision, and a fixed and furious gaze. At first, I had not learned the air, and all at once, I decided to learn it. Instead, I played the tarantella, and the man fell to the ground, yelling with convulsions. Terrified, I did all I could to hurry my learning of the tarantella. As soon as I was ready, I began the performance, staying at a distance of three and a half meters from the tarantato. He, hearing me, rose to his feet right away as he had done before, and danced with as much vigor as any dancer.

The substantial agreement of these various accounts — to one another and to others — and the confirmation drawn from actual survivals in the Sale J demonstrate that we are dealing here with one of the salient characteristics of tarantism in action. We can therefore assert that, as a ritual, it is consistently characterized by the gradual choreutic-musical order of crisis state in which the breakdown of individual presence may be reconstructed. Everything takes place as if a certain order of sounds unblocks the movement, that very elementary rigor at the same time, it is as if the discipline of the rhythm allows the crisis to be reproduced.

The choreutic-musical order takes the form of a very wide symbolic structure, almost like a bridge thrown from Scylla to Charybdis: from the agonizing suspension of inert stupor to the frenetic explosion of a delirious vitality, a vitality lacking in human destiny and headed toward rapid consumption and total annihilation. As a ritual in action, tarantism begins, proceeds, and ends with the very elementary prospect of a renewed opening to historical existence, by locating itself pro tempore under the protection of rhythmic repetition, sure and predictable like the orbit of a planet. Tarantism ushers in its destiny as a cultural phenomenon through the effort to maintain itself in this orbit while dramatically avoiding the recurrent eccentric stresses of total absence, stupefying immobility, or incoherent release. In this way, through the cultural influence of tarantism, the model of choreutic-musical order is maintained. 

musical behavior came to take on for the Apulians the immediate meaning of a very elementary cultural order to be preferentially relied upon when a great existential catastrophe loomed, as we see in the following episode to which the famous Neapolitan doctor Niccolo Cirillo was an eyewitness: !will not remain silent about what | had the opportunity to observe in the hospital of the _ Incurables in the summer of the year 1721 just past. A woman who appeared about forty years was admitted to the hospital as mentally deranged, and after having refused any Sort of food for several days (this was attributed to her madness), she was struck with fever and great weakness, lying on her bed for seven days, not only did she abstain from all food and treatment, threats and entreaties being made in vain, but she also did not utter a single word. On the seventh day of her starvation and silence, as usual | compelled her to drink a little water, but while | did this | realized that although her whole body remained immobile, her hands and head were shaking in a certain rhythm, so that the agitation appeared to correspond to a musical tempo. | began to suspect that we were dealing with a case of tarantism, all the more so since, upon asking from where she had been transported to the hospital, | received the answer that she came from Apulia. | called for some musicians to come, and as soon as the instruments sounded the melodic rhythm called the tarantella, she began to move her hands and head to the rhythm of the music in a more evident manner, and | then saw her, still lying in bed, making gestures which resembled a dance. With the help of the assisting women, she rose up completely, at first held up by them but soon without any support, twisting a red ribbon that | had given her in her hands in a strange fashion. To the great astonishment of all, she wandered about the room for some time, her dance respecting the tempo with rhythmic steps such as her strength would permit and in keeping with the music. Then she avidly drank a cup of cold water that was given to her. She was Put to bed once again and a bit of food was brought, so that having restored her strength she could return to dance, and then I retired. Yet she This sentence and those which follow offer a glimpse into De Martino’s analysis of the functioning of the myth-ritual bond as culture’s institutional “apparatus” for overcoming the crisis of presence. De Martino’s analysis of myth and ritual rests on his key concepts of “crisis of presence,” “institutional dehistorification,” “repetition” and the “ethos of transcendence.” This problem is treated repeatedly in his works and from many angles, and never in a definitive fashion, but the reader may find particularly useful references in De Martino (1995), Storia e metastoria. I fondamenti di una teoria del Sacro, Marcello Massenzio, ed. Lecce: Argo; see especially Massenzio’s introduction and the sections “I fondamenti di una teoria del sacro” and “II nesso mitico-rituale.” De Martino’s posthumous La fine del mondo (Ist ed. 1977, Torino: Einaudi) is also illuminating on these points.

In the face of the tarantula's poison, a popular tradition is mentioned (licitur a ibusdam vulgaribus et ignaris) according to which the taranta produces a tempore sui morsus, hence the notion that the patient, at satisfaction from hearing a melody that coincides with the moment of the bite, "permits the crisis to be given a 'listenable' aspect: the 'melodic re-evocation' of the bite possible in musical terms. The trafi - the Sertum papale is confirmed by other accounts, if not in the details of the melodic bite, in that of a choreutic preference of the melodies, In this regard, Kircher's documentation is particularly helpful as it reveals the fact that he was often ingenuously sympathetic to local customs. No doubt many of the episodes related by Besuit from information provided by brethren from Lecce and Taranto, have for us the value of actual facts occurring just as they are narrated. They are valuable as accounts of the ideology and the myth. The episode of Andria, which concerns the ideology of the relationship between man and the taranta, is described by Kircher in his Magnes and in the Musurgia: What provokes great amazement is the fact that for a certain Sea basi tion in man and in the taranta... the same reaction arouses the same reaction in dance through the continuous ex stimulated by the music drives the man to u at i i ikewise i | would never have believed this ha of his muscles, it does likewise in the taranta.

And if the musician ceased playing, the little beast also suspended its dance. The Fathers learned that what they had marveled at in Andria as an extraordinary episode was in Taranto a customary fact. Indeed, the musicians of Taranto treat this illness in the capacity of public officials paid regular salaries (this to help meet the needs of the poor and relieve them of the expense); in order to accelerate the recovery of the patients in an easier and more certain manner, they usually ask the victims the color of the taranta and the place where they were bitten. After this, the citharoedic doctors go at once to the place indicated, where different kinds of tarante in great number are busy weaving their webs. The musicians try out various types of harmonies, amazingly making some tarante leap in turn. When they notice a taranta leap that is of the color indicated by the patient, they take it as a sure sign that they have found the modulation in exact proportion to the poisonous humor of the tarantato and quite suitable to his treatment, whose performance, they say, yields him a sure therapeutic effect.6

In the framework of this ideology, Kircher recalls the case of a Spaniard residing in Taranto who, incredulous as to what was told to him regarding the choreutic-musical sympathies between men and spiders, had himself bitten by two tarante of differing color and size. As a result, he became doubly tarantato, with the aggravating circumstance of not being able to take advantage of the musical cure due to the incompatibility of the two melodies which were to be employed, each of which being uncongenial to the other taranta; because of this incompatibility the healing dance was not performed. Tormented by a conflict which was so unsolvable, the poor Spaniard gave up the ghost, demonstrating with his example — Kircher ingenuously warns us — “how dangerous it is to place oneself at risk in such deadly experiments without suitable precautions.”6

It is quite doubtful that the search for the melody suited to the taranta, and thus the tarantato, took place — as Kircher states — in the diagnostic phase of the healing ritual with an exploration conducted by musicians wandering through the fields. In this regard, the accuracy of Baglivi’s testimony is more likely, where one of his “clinical cases” relates how the musicians conducted the musical exploration directly on the tarantata: «Once the musicians arrived, they asked the patient the size and color of the taranta, and did so in order to adapt their music. But the patient answered that she did not know if she had been bitten by a taranta or a scorpion. They began testing, and upon the fourth melody the tarantata immediately began to sigh. Finally, unable to resist the impulse to dance and freed from the restraint of modesty, she jumped nearly nude from the bed and danced vigorously for three days, thus healing.®

The diagnostic musical exploration carried out directly on the patient is, moreover, confirmed by various authors, and it is practiced even today in the Salento. On the other hand, the curious confusion of musicians who wander through fields in search of tarante to enchant with their sounds is reported solely by Kircher. Whatever is to be made of this, it is certain that in the myth the tarante appear sensitive to music and dance, and according to their size and color they show preferences for one melody or another; moreover, through the bite and poison, they transmit their preference to the bite victims in such a way that in order to provoke the curing dance, the musicians must make a series of attempts to individuate the melody suited to the case, that is, the one which sympathetically links the taranta and tarantato. : ; The musical instruments are also included in the articulation of the symbol. They take part in its lived weft of sympathies and antipathies in that the impulse to dance arises electively in each case only if it is stimulated by particular instruments, and in the course of the dance it is fueled by the changing affective inclinations for one of these. At least until the end of the seventeenth century, the instruments traditionally employed were of various types: some may be seen in the list in Appendix 3. The choice was determined case by case "with reference to the variety of poison," as Kircher claims. Thus, for example, some patients displayed particular sensitivity to the rhythmic striking of percussion instruments, others to song accompanied by the roar of trumpets, while still others enjoyed lyres, zithers, and harpsichords. In this regard, Kircher recalls a maiden from Taranto "who could only be enticed to dance by the thunder of drums, by the explosion of bombardons, by the blast of trumpets — in short, by instruments capable of producing violent sounds."

Boccone tells us how those who had been bitten by scorpions appreciated tarantelle and pastorals just as much as those bitten by the tarantula, but played on other instruments "that is, on zampogna [a type of Italian bagpipe], Pan-pipes, French musette, Sicilian ciaramelli and a war drum roughly beaten by someone striking it from above and below with clubs"; the musette and drum players moved their bodies comically and performed "jests and ridiculous farces."

The passion that characterized the relationship between the tarantato and the musical instruments was demonstrated, among other things, by certain affective behaviors which took place during the choreutic-musical treatment. As we were able to observe during the ethnographic fieldwork of 1959, the person performing the dance at times moves among the musicians, displaying a particular preferential tie with one instrument or another, for example with the tambourine or violin.

The tradition of the affective relationship between the musical instruments and the tarantati was first documented by Epifanio Ferdinando, although it was distorted by the misunderstanding that the patients were hard of hearing: "The true deaf do not dance, only the hard of hearing do; in fact, those who are deaf since birth have never heard music, and therefore they cannot be stimulated... With regard to those hard of hearing, we saw one, bitten by a taranta, who always kept his ears near the musical instruments, and only in this way danced and exulted, hardly straying from the instruments."

We find the same tradition in Ludovico Valletta, without the misunderstanding of the "hard of hearing," when he performed the treatment for a monk of the Lucera monastery. This brother "quidam rusticis negotiis praefectus monachus, aetate maturus, simplex potius, et prorsus inurbanus homo, quam fucare suas @ctiones quoquomodo gnarus" had been a tarantato for many years, and every year, with the arrival of the summer season, he repeated the dance in the usual fashion. Through the years, however, the stimulus to dance had lessened, and Valletta predicted that it would soon cease entirely.

Now, it happened that on an August day, Valletta started to play violin in his cell for his own enjoyment. Upon hearing the violin, the brother, who lay ill in the cell next door, dashed into Valletta's cell in his nightshirt and sat on the edge of the bed groaning and sighing. Valletta asked what was wrong with him, to which the poor monk replied with a sigh; but then, remembering that the brother was a tarantato, he began to play the rapid rhythm of the melody known to reawaken the tarantati. The tarantato brother rose immediately to his feet, and standing in front of the violin, he stared at it with wide eyes and an absorbed expression. Then, beating the tempo with his head and raising himself up on his toes, he bent toward the violin. “Like a fervent, impatient lover before his long-desired object,” says Valletta, “he seemed to suffer from great anxiety, almost as if he wanted to swallow that melody with his wide-open eyes.” This behavior lasted for about an hour, in front of all of the monks of the monastery, who had rushed to witness the scene. With this yearning expression set upon the violin at great length and with a tenuous hint of dance, the brother's tribute to the taranta, from that year on, had ended forever.3

But the choreutic-musical symbol of tarantism is further specified with the aim of concretely reaching the single existential crises suffered by each farantato; that is, the traditional horizon of the symbol also includes a traditionalized repertory of music and songs from among which the most suitable one (or ones) may be chosen for an individual case. Each tarantula “loves its own melody,” as we have already said in citing the words of Epifanio Ferdinando. But in the economy of the symbol, only some types of music were expected, and tradition set a definite number of possibilities according to specifications of time and place. As we learn from the aforementioned Sertum papale de venenis, in the fourteenth century the tarantati especially enjoyed musical tunes called Pelandra and Dama di Provenza, which gives an idea of the variety of the musical resources used in the earliest tarantism. It is only from the seventeenth century on, with the development of an actual literature on tarantism, that our information becomes more precise and the use of various tarantellas is indicated as typical in the iatromusical practice: Generally, all of the tarantati love the sort of music that here is commonly called the tarantella. There are many varieties: the cinque tempi [five tempos], the panno verde [green cloth], the panno rosso [red cloth], the moresca [Moorish], and the spallata [shoulder shove]; but the latter is very rarely danced, while the others are danced more often, and each tarantato performs the one he prefers.* Kircher has preserved some tarantellas for us which were used during treatment, namely, the Turkish air, the Sicilian octave, a tarantella from Taranto and one from Naples. To Kircher’s examples we must add the tarantella of Torre Annunziata, transcribed by Stefano Storace,* and the material collected in the ethnographic fieldwork of 1959.3

Sometimes the song simply ins The poisonous tarantula. Ist semi-chorus: _E t’ha muzzecatu lu pede? _ Did it bite your foot? 2nd semi-chorus: E m’ha muzzecatu lu pede. It bit my foot. Chorus: Pede ccu pede se ne vene Foot by foot it comes Pede ccu pede se ne va Foot by foot it goes

La signora tarantula.* The lady tarantula. The first semi-chorus asks who did the biting, and the second one answers: the poisonous faranta; the first semi-chorus presses by asking where the taranta has bitten, and the second semi-chorus responds: the foot. Immediately after this determination and symbolic localization comes the resolution of the spell by the entire chorus, in which the pursuit of the dancing feet (“foot by foot it comes, foot by foot it goes”) and their rhythmic stamping of the ground break loose in the cathartic images of the taranta that “goes away” with dancing or else is crushed or stomped by the dancing feet. The passage of nesolution is underlined by the apparent expressive disjointedness of the “goes which can be ambiguously interpreted either as the one foot which goes with the other in the rhythm of the dance, or as the “lady tarantula” that “goes away” as a result of the dancing. But if we reintegrate the literary text within the concrete unity of the ritual, the disjointedness and ambiguity disappear, and all of the details of the text regain sense and function. By virtue of such an integration, even the alteration of tarantula in tarantula, with the accent on the last syllable, ceases to be a banal expedient dictated by the rhyme and becomes the going away of the tarantula evoked through the rhyming of goes [se ne va] with tarantula.

A structure analogous to that of this little Calabrian “ritual drama” is seen in some songs reported by Kircher in a rather fragmentary and disorderly fashion. Thus, for example, verses such as the following must have belonged to the technique of the localizing question and the answer: Deu ti muzzicau la tarantella? Where did the tarantella bite you? Sotto la pudia de la vanella." Under the fringe of my skirt. Verses in which the entire episode is freed from the fatal rule of the taranta and placed under the more amiable rule of Apulian wine must have instead belonged to the resolution part of the spell: Non fu taranta né fu la tarantella It was not the aranta nor the tarantella Ma fu lu vino della garretella." But rather the wine from the jug.

The structure that is barely perceptible in Kircher’s fragmentary and disorderly documentation is fully manifested in a Tarantine exorcism recorded in 1931: Tha pizzicata, tha muzzicata it bit you la taranta awvilinata the poisoned taranta T’ha muzzicato sopra la mano: _ It bit you on your hand: ela minammo luntano luntano."! And we'll chase it far, far away. It stung you

The first four verses identify the symbolic culprit (the taranta), define the nature of its attack (the bite), and locate the place where it bit (the hand). The fifth verse encapsulates the moment of resolution, chasing off the tarantula which “goes away” inasmuch as it is carried as far away as possible with the music and the dance. Another Tarantine exorcism confirms that the spell intends to identify and reach the place of the bite and “kill” the taranta: Addo t’ha pizzicata Where did it sting you pozz’essere uccisa: so it can be killed: e sotto alle funniedde under the hem di la cammisa.* of the nightdress. The foot, the hand, the genitalia: these are the preferential locations of the taranta “bite” which are given by the symbolic horizon of tarantism. But this horizon provides for images and behaviors of resolution, since the foot is “armed” with dance, the hand is “armed” with a sword, and the ritual as a whole is an image of resolution that is dramatically acquired and lived through a trampling and combative choreutic-musical rhythm. As for the “bite” localized on the genitalia, the symbolic horizon of tarantism features particular instruments of resolution in songs dominated by the recurrent theme of an unhappy love, of an eros frustrated for various reasons which is freed in melancholy accents.

* A pun by De Martino: the Italian term amabile has the double meaning of “amiable” and “sweet” (as a feature of wine).

THE CHOREUTIC-MUSICAL SYMBOLISM 101

b the “Siculan rhythm” known as the “Sicilian octave,” Kircher associates “To the following song: Stu pettu ¢ fattu cimbalu d’amuri Tasti li sensi mobili e accorti Cordi li chianti, suspiri e duluri Rosa é lu cori miu feritu a morti Strali é lu ferru, chiai so li miei Marteddu é lu pensieri, e la mia sorti . - : Mastra é la donna mia, ch’a tutti Phuri ; co Cantando canta leta la mia morti.

Suicide for frustrated eros, the impulse to die for despairing love, a dash to the sea to disappear in the waves — all of these find a horizon ina ritual that was practiced in Taranto and Brindisi: the tarantato in crisis, tied with a rope to the stern of a boat, was allowed to be exult at his ease in the waters of the sea, while the musicians in the boat tried to impose the rhythm of their melodies upon the sufferer.' But usually it was enough to use songs that elaborated on themes of the sea and______ The corrected text is as follows:

Such was the case of a Capuchin monk of Taranto, whose superiors had prohibited the performance of a musical exorcism: irresistibly stimulated by the impulse to plunge himself into the water, he fled the monastery like a madman and headed to the sea with great vehemence, only to find a miserable death by drowning instead of relief for his illness. The preferential localizations of the bite — on the hand, foot, or genitalia ~ once again raise the problem of the symbolic autonomy of tarantism. As for the “bite on the genitalia,” there is no difficulty in perceiving in it an obvious symbolic value for the most diverse erotic conflicts, even without making reference to a remote castration complex. Bites on the hand or foot could be linked to the realistic consideration that hands and feet are at particular risk for a bite, but it is necessary to consider the possibility that here, too, the same symbolic autonomy operates as is definitely present in the “bite on the genitalia” and which generally affects tarantism on the whole as a cultural phenomenon.

The fact remains that a tingling sensation on the soles of the feet is one of the typical symptoms of latrodectism.”” This justifies how, in the behavior of the poisoned victim, an itching on the soles of the feet can enter into the symbolic weft by virtue of a traditionalized paradigm: influenced, a somatic conversion of states of psychic tension. In relation to this, THE CHOREUTIC-MUSICAL SYMBOLISM 103 istic moment of the dance is characterized by a stamping of the soles on the ground, the very soles where it appears that the trouble and focus are concentrated, as if to trample or squash the poisonous result of the healing tarantella.

In the case of Venosa in the summer of 1596, the son of a certain Tartaric family was said to dance “with a sword tied to his feet” — that is, with a sword attached to his feet. Through this fashioning, increasingly independent of the symptom of actual bites, the itch is also localized on the hands and even other parts of the body. In his monograph on Apulian tarantism, Carrieri speaks of “an extraordinary itch of the flesh, common to all of the tarantated,” only localized on the soles of the feet.* In the aforementioned article in The Gentleman's Magazine, we read that during the attacks, the tarantato scratched his hands furiously, “as if he wanted to tear himself to pieces.” People knew that the tarantato needed a sword, and in fact one was sent to him. The tarantato then began a sword dance, during which, always in the rhythm of the tarantella, he passed the sword from one hand to the other, heedless of wounding himself with the tip. Holding the sword to strike himself, alternating between his hands and feet for almost an hour, bleeding profusely. Here, it is also possible to study the symbolism of the sword in a more limited and immediate sense: as given to the itchy hands. The imitation of the poisoned victim's behavior in dancing, tending to come to blows, and in reference to this the cultural modeling for giving a sword to the tarantato, with which he could express drive in different ways. This preference and the wave of frustrated affect in general seem to elective the musical horizon in the tarantella, at least from what we have documented from the seventeenth century on. As late as 1870, we find a case of tarantism in which the patient manifested a particular tendency to dance, but without any relationship to the bite. The scholar named De Simone found 12 different bene aed ie motives which were used in exploring the tarantati to es [i ase — that is, which caused the dance. Unfortunately, le ee a ee the melodies, limiting himself to differentiating the "piace" (with the violin) and the "beaten "extended modes" (with the melodic prese q ee modes" (just the tambourine, struck with an open hand). Moreover, saan Tesources used in the exorcism at one time included still other lee : - c which we are scantily informed.

The naturalist Paolo Boccone explicitly p' the pastoral next to the tarantella: There are two sonatas which the tarantolati love: one is the tarantella and nord is the pastoral. Both are varied by the musicians according to their — - i and letters. The instruments which accompany the dance of the penne 3. Suitar, violin, and a small drum with little white or yellow tin bells, which call a tambourine.** 104 THE LAND OF REMORSE

Widely cited, too, is the use of funeral lament. As we have already stated, in the crisis of tarantism there was a component of anxious depression which gave rise to behavior resembling the crisis of mourning. Referring to the polarity of excitation and depression, Kircher gave tarantism the appellative of “joyful misery”:*° but the misery manifested in the crisis of tarantism gets mixed up with mourning, even if the depressed tarantato does not know exactly whose death he is mourning.

Now, with respect to the incumbent threat of this crisis and the impulses it led to (wandering among graves, isolation, lying in a coffin, desperate flights to the sea, suicides in wells, etc.),* the symbolic horizon of funeral lament could in certain cases aid the process of evocation and release of the mislaid conflicts more than the tarantella could. And in fact, the earliest literature attests unanimously to the use of funeral laments during the musical exorcism.

Of some of the tarantati, Epifanio Ferdinando says funestos et lugubres amant cantus et naenias [they love mournful and woeful songs and dirges]*’ and elsewhere confirms that mixolodicam melodiam amant, qui est cantus melancholicus solus tragoediis accomodatus, sub qua naenia comprehenditur'®

In the episode of the noblewoman of Lucera told by Valletta (cf. below, pp. 117ff.), we are certainly not capable of determining what the personal conflict was that found a horizon in the ritual sequence carried out every summer by the tarantata; but there is no doubt that, after a first part dominated by the dramatic tarantella, the conclusive resolution took place at the stimulus of a funeral dirge — that is, with the beneficial release of weeping followed by placid sleep and an awakening in conditions of reestablished normality.

Some confirmation must exist for the behavior of the noblewoman of Lucera if Kircher notes that “many farantati, after dancing for some time, take a seat and strike their hands forcefully on their knees, as if they want to free themselves with sighs and laments from some passion or calamity weighing upon their souls.” Precisely in order to give a horizon to this melancholy and anxious moment in the crisis of tarantism, in the rural areas of Taranto a bipartite tarantella was used in which the slow, lamenting first part was followed by a rapid and vigorous second part. For analogous reasons, melancholy arias are still used today in the Salento, sung with narrative songs of popular Italian poetry such as J/ cognato traditore, Scibilia Nobili and Rosina al ballo. The importance of the choreutic-musical symbolism in tarantism endowed the musicians with the character of exorcists, doctors, and artists. The success of the musical "exploration" and the efficacious treatment depended on their participation and skill. Unfortunately, we know little about the musicians who formed the bands seen by D'Alessandro during his trip in the late fifteenth century. Kircher only incidentally provides information that the musicians in seventeenth-century Taranto were public officials, paid with regular salaries to relieve the poorest people of the musical exorcism's hefty expense.

It does not appear that they always limited themselves to the Mixolydian melody, the only melancholic song suited to tragedies, which includes dirges. Novoli, a violinist, was blind. Mazzotta was blin_ the poor THE CHOREUTIC-MUSICAL SYMBOLISM 105 ical performance alone, at least judging from the "jests" and "ridiculous si i ibandoned themselves, _ to which the musette and tambourine players al i cone. 5 : ee es were still well-known musicians for tarantati in the yr! ee Salentine scholar De Simone met and Lente a ae ey r i bourine player, and a certain Tancesco i _ apn 4 and had been exercising his office for thirty s, each summer traveling through the Lands and Hamlets, called to many aces for his exceptional skill and for the miraculous cures he obtained thanks bow and perhaps also to his lifeless eyes.

The historical literature on tarantism confirms and further specifies this relationship by showing how, on the symbolic level, the rarante are consistently associated not only with certain melodies, but also certain colors. Thus, in order to exorcise the tarantato, it is necessary to identify the color of his taranta along with its music. As the documentation shows, in the past, a chromatic exploration existed which corresponded precisely to the musical exploration. We find evidence for this in an ad hoc device which was sometimes used: two ropes were attached to the walls and crossed the room diagonally at a certain height from the floor, and from them cloths of various colors were hung like flags; during the dance, the tarantata would choose a colored cloth to her liking upon which to release her ambivalences, and the color of the poisoning taranta was deduced from her choice. Clearly, such a device corresponded to the succession of melodies offered to the tarantata in crisis to induce her to select the music of her taranta from among the various tunes in the traditional repertory. But even when a device of this sort was not part of the local tradition, the search for the evocative chromatic symbol was one of the traits of the exorcism in action.

A diligent observation conducted in Grottaglie in the summer of 1882 describes a scene whose protagonist was a nineteen-year-old dancer. During the dance, she stared avidly at a multicolored cloth unfurled in her hand like a book to be read. Only when she approached the violin in her dancing did she stop staring at the cloth, turning her gaze upon the instrument with the same longing intensity.® In short, apart from the technical apparatus of evocation, these two examples confirm that choreutic-musical symbolism and chromatic symbolism in tarantism both performed the function of evocative stimulus and release. We might even say—and this should not seem a baroque image, since there is a certain baroque tendency in the very thing being examined—that during the exorcism in action, certain sounds combined with certain colors, certain colors with certain sounds, and all of them, by virtue of the myth of the taranta of sound and color, singer and dancer, contributed to the founding of a specific horizon for the search, THE SYMBOLISM OF COLOR 107 recovery and elimination of certain conflicts buried in the unconscious in the process of being converted into neurotic symptoms.

Kircher notes the following: Some tarantati appear irresistibly attracted to the color green, others by the color atl others by red. As soon as they catch sight of an object that is of the color that ails them, they are so excited by desire for it that they fling themselves on it like ravenous lions in order to bite it repeatedly. Then they shift to enthrallment and caution, tormented by an amorous madness; with mouths wide open, open arms, tears in their eyes, panting, they clutch the colored cloth in an amorous embrace and appear to feign an ardent union, as it were, an identification with it.°° Gerolamo Marciano of Leverano observed in the early seventeenth century how some farantati were offended by red; according to their moods, others disliked blue, yellow, green, or grey, while other tarantati appeared delighted by these very same colors and danced with them. 'Baglivi states that the farantart loved to wear garments of pretty colors, especially red and blue, but seni exception they all manifested a great repulsion for black, hurling sat a on anyone who wore clothes of this color. Valletta expresses himse! mos succinctly of all: “(The tarantati] love and hate one color or another in et and in objects.” The link between chromatic symbolism and choreutic-musica symbolism is shown by the fact that the names themselves of the melodies, according to the list furnished by Epifanio, refer in at least two cases io a precise chromatic indication: evidently the “red cloth” and the “green cloth” have been choreutic-musical themes in which, during the exorcism, “red” and “green” respectively dominated in the form of cloths or colored ribbons.

In tarantism, these two colors were linked to two distinct types of ritual performances, as we see from the following passage by Kircher: For those under the influence of green, cheerful songs are customarily sung which ee with luxuriant gardens, meadows, pleasant woods. For those under the influence of re or the radiance of arms, martial rhythms were instead used, along with iambic, Bacchic and dithyrambic meters. Finally, for those who had an inclination for water, love = were employed which spoke of rivers, springs, waterfalls: and it was a — t _ to see how songs of this sort calmed not only the choreutic passion but also feelings | sadness, love, anger and vendetta.

To complete the picture of symbolic connections, Kircher tells us that - colors which acquired symbolic value during the exorcism were traditionally connected to the colors of the poisonous taranta or even with the inclinations that the taranta displayed toward one color or another: Different tarantulas stimulate the tarantati towards different colors... in such a way that the bite victims of red tarantulas are drawn to red, green tarantulas to green, and so forth... The tarantulas are delighted by a certain color, as demonstrated by the = =o if they are placed on different colored surfaces, they are attracted to the one similar to their own color.

In order to translate these notes from the earliest literature on tarantism into the language of our interpretation, the mythical saranta, its mythical bite and the symbolism of color are all connected to mythical colors, which help to evoke certain psychic conflicts, using a stimulus which is added to the musical and choreutic stimuli. Together with the choreutic-musical horizons, the chromatic horizons formed a lesser symbolic articulation within the wider, more comprehensive unitary horizon of the mythic-ritual symbol of tarantism.

The institutional order of tarantism offers the tarantato the ceremonial scenery of multicolor cloths and ribbons, mythically linked to the color of the poisonous faranta: according to the conflict tormenting him, each tarantato would then choose the colored objects to stare at, and through these release love and hate, mania and melancholy. In this regard, it is worth examining whether or not there is a conceivable connection between the chromatic symbolism of tarantism and medieval chromatic symbolism, and whether green in tarantism is to be interpreted as the color of new love, inan image of reawakened nature, and red the color of fighting spirit and stubbornness, of aggression and fury, of ardent and armed passion: the passage by Kircher above is a meaningful indication in this direction.' In any case, the analysis of the earliest literature at least allows us to conclude that the chromatic inclinations and repulsions in tarantism are related to the individual conflicts that flow into the mythical-ritual symbolism in action: in this culturally-conditioned symbolic framework, the colors acquire the meaning of visual surfaces for the stimulation, evocation and release of affective conflicts that “re-bite” in secret. To illustrate this relationship, an episode reported by Kircher might be of use. The Jesuit Father tells of the Archbishop of Taranto, who was at that time the Cardinal Caetani. Having learned that a Capuchin monk underwent the musical exorcism daily in the monastery, the Archbishop wanted to see this for himself and went to visit the tarantato friar. And here is what followed, according to the report that Kircher received from his informant, Galliberto:

As the scarlet prelate appeared [in the cell where the exorcism took place], the dancer abandoned his dance, and with changed appearance, ludicrous gestures and odd body movements he was entranced at the sight of the amiable scarlet; he could hardly be kept back until he was in possession of it. In fact, he remained stupefied gazing at it, his eyes staring as if they sought something extremely small, first yearning for it ardently with his open, panting mouth, then drawing his nose near to it as if to delight in its aroma. Since he was not permitted to come closer, he seemed at a loss, not being able to find any relief for his desire: in fact, on the one hand he could not, for reverence, fling himself upon the scarlet, and on the other hand, afflicted by the torment of possession, he fell into a state of deep and grievous depression.

At the sight of this, the cardinal wanted to experience such odd behavior more closely, and not being convinced of what he had been told of the occurrence, he spontaneously offered the Capuchin tarantato his scarlet Parament, to see if the patient's agitation would end once he had obtained it. And in fact, as soon as the Capuchin took possession of it, he began to idolize it and caress it, appearing to want to absorb it into himself in a thousand ways, placing it on his cheeks, then on his forehead and then on his breast, and sketching a step of dance - in short, gesturing and behaving, according to what we read, the way those who suffer from the mania of love gesture and behave.

The historical documentation from the sixteenth century to the present testifies unanimously to the summer season as the period of tarantism, from the beginning of May to the end of August. Ponzetti indicates the summer as the period in which the tarante bite more often and their poison is more dangerous. The Neapolitan scholar Alessandro D’Alessandro situates tarantism in the burning heat of the Apulian summer; and likewise, a particularly intense and widespread tarantism broke out in Venosa in the month of August, as mentioned by Bruni in his Dialogo delle Tarantole. About a century after Ponzetti, Epifanio Ferdinando repeats that the taranta is more dangerous in the summer than in other seasons. This is confirmed by Baglivi, who states that the Poison of the taranta is heightened by the summer heat as well as by the spider's mating season. Similarly, the descriptions by Valletta and Caputo refer explicitly to a summer setting, as do the descriptions from the last century on, up to the data from our ethnographic fieldwork. The historical documentation is also unanimous in affirming that just as the “first bite” takes place in the summer season, so does its “re-bite” — that is, the renewal of the crisis which tends to occur in approximately the period in which the victim had suffered the “first bite.” Repetit quotannis multis tarantatis haec affectio fere stato tempore in aestate,* says Epifanio;” and Baglivi confirms that, despite the musical cure, the poison returned every year to make its effects felt," precisely in the period in which the tarantato had been bitten for the first time.*! Thus, for example, Baglivi relates the case of a noblewoman from Lecce who had to undergo the musical cure every year with the onset of the period of her “first bite.”® Nicola Caputo reports an exception, which nonetheless appears to prove the rule: a certain Domenica Gianfreda, who had been a tarantata for several years, did not want to dance because she was pregnant and feared a miscarriage. But once she had given birth and the autumn came, the calendrical period of the exorcism having come to a close (transacto jam tempore tarantatis idoneo), the woman was in difficulty for not having performed the dance. Her illness continued into the midst of a harsh winter, until it was decided to make her dance out of season in a well-heated environment, with doors and windows closed.* Epifanio Ferdinando, too, does not rule out that Some farantati might, as an exception, dance twice in the same summer or even two or three times during the year, irrespective of the season.** Moreover, the historical documentation agrees on a third point: the impossibility of being able to establish how many subsequent summers the taranta will te-bite, how long This affliction repeats every year for the tarantati around the appointed period of the summer. THE SYMBOLISM OF SEASON Att reutic performance will last, and the length and number of the single 4 cles of each performance.

The scholar Gaudenzio Merula of Novara even states that only peasants are exposed to the danger of being bitten by poisonous spiders (haec onmig phalangiorum genera incolis tantum sunt infesta‘),* and Kircher emphasizes how tarantism strikes above all peasants, gardeners, reapers, shepherds and whomever else is compelled, during the summer months, to dwell in the fields and sleep there without adequate protection for his body.” On the other hand, the earliest exegetes of tarantism are forced with some embarrassment to admit data which do not fit into their “reductive” explanation, especially regarding the predominant participation of women in tarantism (the isolated thesis of Epifanio Ferdinando on the independence of the phenomenon from gender has the appearance of a forced adaptation of the facts to the chosen explanatory model). It is precisely the greatest representative of the medical literature on tarantism, Baglivi, who sought to get out of this predicament by postulating the existence of two tarantisms, an “authentic” one deriving from an actual poisoning from the bite of the Apulian tarantula, and an “inauthentic” one of women taken up with their “little carnivals. ”% The results of the ethnographic fieldwork enable us to evaluate the interpretation of the earliest writers. The real bite of a poisonous arachnid during the summer harvest does indeed constitute an essential condition for tarantism, but at the same time, tarantism cannot be “reduced” to one of its conditions, important as it may be from the point of view of the phenomenon’s genesis, Cases of latrodectism ~ real poisoning ~ are favored by harvesting, gleaning, vegetable- picking, the grape harvest and other agricultural activities performed when poisonous spiders are most numerous and move most quickly, and when females are most aggressive because they have their egg sacs. But tarantism, like any cultural phenomenon, far transcends the conditions of its origin, and it takes place in full “symbolic” autonomy, even if this is an existentially-conditioned autonomy (but every cultural autonomy has sucha conditioning). 

Latrodectism offered the existential matter upon which the symbolic behavior of the poisoned victim was elaborated. This means that even the meager minority stricken with the toxic syndrome refashioned the morbid State into the weft of tarantism and sometimes continued to be "tarantato" for the rest of their lives, while the vast majority invented the episode of the first bite, perhaps in the condition in which it was most probable and most credible: during the harvest. Sometimes the tarantato did not even respect this condition of probability and credibility, suffering from the crisis in situations which had nothing to do with the harvest and which were themselves symbolically oriented. Thus the connection between tarantism and the summer season must essentially be considered on the symbolic level. This season to which we are referring is not a set of bare astronomical and meteorological data, of changes in the animal or vegetable kingdom, of mere work opportunities. Rather, this season is the existential reality of the Apulian summer during the period between the Middle Ages and the eighteenth century, in the corresponding socio-economic frameworks which were dominant in the region and differentiated by place and all of these types of phalangids are dangerous only for the peasants.

It is precisely within this oye a a series of experiences connected to the harvest was articulated: to fel spikes of wheat with sickle strokes, pluck fruit from trees, trample on grapes in a vat, meant becoming agents of anguish and death in the realm of food plants, ave the void in vegetation and labor in the wake of harvest time, running up against the insecurity of the new agricultural year,‘ braving the perils of the sun’s — —as piercing as arrows — and those of crafty little animals whose Laos slipped a mortal languor into the veins and a desperate anxiety id the oe A period of such high social tension was in and of itself pre ve : spilling over into a symbolic time of existential frustrations, transforming i = : into a period in which all unresolved conflicts blossomed. This was a ae which the antinomies of human destiny in a peasant society imposed themse ay upon the consciousness with exceptional energy, and in which the power cs limit of transforming labor were tested in the most significant way. Thus the summer had, so to speak, a preferential claim to becoming the seasonal cure for the evocation and release of a wretched past. The period of the year when productive forces were measured through the harvest of the land’s most precious fruits in turn opened up the horizon of another harvest, to be carried in invisible fields with a symbolic sickle. The period which signified the end of paying debts on an economic level, was transformed on the eve into a period in which existential debts, too, could be paid - de ts an - accumulated in the depths of the soul. And finally, since it sometimes happened that a bite by a more or less poisonous spider took place while gleaning, plucking fruit from a branch or gathering remnants, images of the bite and the spider avoided the requirements of a logic of interpretation.

This interpretation of the agricultural cycle as an existential drama is central to Demetrione's analysis of funeral lament, Morte e pianto rituale nel mondo antico. Dal lamento pag pianto di Maria (1958, Turin: Einaudi). 114 THE LAND OF REMORSE toward the “observation of nature”; instead, they operated as a shuttle in an autonomous weaving whose warp followed the coherence of symbolic logic, Thus instead of horizonless individual crises, in which the frustrations caused by life in society were able to crop back up at any moment of the year in the form of neurotic symptoms, the seasonal symbolism of tarantism offered above all a means of anchoring such crises to the time limits of a certain period; it modeled the crisis according to the behavior of the poisoned victim, and it presented a mythical-ritual plan of evocation and release through the symbolism of music, dance and colors, in an adequate ceremonial setting. By virtue of the seasonal symbolism, the individual crises potentially scattered in time in a random fashion tended to gather and concentrate in an elective period of onset, where they found an entire symbolic system ready to enter into action and operate its efficacy as resolution, with the society’s consensus and assistance. In this way, the periods “out of season” were advantageously freed of the risk of the crisis, and a deferred payment was instituted for existential debts incurred.

Another advantage accrued was the division of the payment into installments in subsequent summers, through the symbol of the bite which “re-bit” every year with the return of the period of “first bite,” and which could be exorcised every year in the “green” paradise of lost loves, in the “red” paradise of unachieved glory and power, and in everything else offered by the dream apparatus of tarantism in action. Besides Apulian tarantism, the symbolic transfiguration of a harmful animal hidden in the crops has its analogous counterpart in the so-called “harvest animal” which lies in wait for the reapers.

According to the available documentation regarding this animal, when a reaper falls ill, is weary, indolent or injured by the sickle, it is said that “the white horse brushed him,” “he has the white she-dog,” “the harvest billy goat butted him,” “the cow hurt him” or “the white she-dog bit him.” In general, harvesters avoid getting bumped into during the agricultural activity by the devilish “animal of the cereals,” since this would have unfortunate consequences. When the moment comes to reap the last sheaf, expressions like these circulate through the field: “Beware of the wolf!”, “Let’s chase the wolf out of the field!”, “We're about to kill the dog. 

"Finally, when the last sheaf is reaped, the person who reaped it cries: “Bull, bull,” or else it is said that the reaper “has” the animal of the cereals — that is, he possesses it. It is a possession which, at the same time, is a state of being possessed by it, and which is sometimes accompanied by actual zooanthropic behavior (for example, if the harvest animal is a wolf, the reaper will bite and howl like a wolf, if it is a rooster he will imitate the crowing of a rooster, if it is a hen he will cluck like a sitting hen and be offered grains of wheat to peck), The harvest animal has undoubtedly been elaborated in a substantially different symbolic perspective from that of tarantism; the symbol in fact promiscuously includes various animals which lie in wait for the harvesters and damage the De Martino discusses these harvest rituals, using the ethnographic example of the “sickle game” of San Giorgio Lucano, in his essay “La messe del dolore” in Furore, Simbolo, Valore (1962, Milan: Saggiatore, pp. 213-223).

What is stable in tarantism is certainly the mythical-ritual symbol of the taranta and the exorcism of dance, music and colors; in this perspective, the “sleeper” taranta — one immune to any musical and choreutic treatment whatsoever — symbolically marks the limit of the efficacy of the exorcism itself. There are also the well-defined elements of the scenic horizon of the forest,______ The ritual performance features a certain fluidity linked to the conflicts that the tarantato must "represent," and this fluidity is seen in the various mimetic actions. According to Epifanio Ferdinando, there were at least two different performances, "green cloth" and "red cloth," dominated by green and red as symbolic colors.

As seen in the passage by Kircher cited above, the character of the songs employed varied according to the inclination of the tarantati and the nature of their crisis. Baglivi states that those who danced with vine leaves had been bitten by the taranta, while those who danced with unsheathed swords had been stung by a scorpion. Serao learned from an Apulian informant that those bitten by a scorpion delighted in "more thunderous sounds than those who had been touched by the tarantula," sounds of drums and horns. Boccone says that those bitten by scorpions fancied war drums "struck roughly on both sides with drumsticks."

Baglivi notes that at times the tarantati wanted to be struck on their hands, their feet or their buttocks, in a sort of masochistic furor. In single performances, a succession of various symbolisms could take place, as seems to have been the case observed by the scholar Cataldantonio Atenisio Carducci in the second half of the eighteenth century: a tarantata in various styles and dresses performed no less than twenty-four different dances, "now with sword in hand, now with ribbons, and now with leafy vine-shoots."

The ritual performance's plasticity gives the impression of a marked plasticity within the stable framework of the symbol of the taranta, just as if the symbolic apparatus were called upon from one instance to the next to adapt itself to each individual symbolism. There may have been local forms of the ritual, with preferred symbolisms that had greater currency through tradition in more circumscribed areas of the Apulian region.

To illustrate this plasticity, we can consider two different ritual performances observed, respectively, by Valletta and Sangenito. Valletta's description refers to a noblewoman of Lucera, bitten by the taranta seven years before getting married and forced to dance each year as the summer season drew near, the period of her "first bite":

During her dances, the tarantata always observes the following rite. Before dancing for ten or fifteen days, she lies in bed ill, anguished, panting, lacking appetite and eating, slowly, only if forced to. As the illness becomes more serious and her body is enfeebled by the prolonged fasting, the musicians are summoned. In the bedroom, iridescent purple fabrics are placed everywhere, and a wide basin filled with water is set in the middle of the room and adorned with leafy green fronds; on the surrounding walls, two mirrors of remarkable size are readied. The musicians sound the motive which they have recognized as suitable for stimulating her to dance. The woman comes forth now beautifully dressed as a bride, her locks appropriately done and wrapped in multicolor ribbons, her fingers, chest, neck and ears sparkling with gems and gold. First, the woman walks solemnly around the bedroom, then little by little she begins to dance, and she dances to the point of becoming astonishingly flush from the various immoderate, abnormal and agitated movements she performs with her feet, hands, head, eyes, with her whole body, moving forward, back, to the right, to the left, from down to up and from up to down. After tiring herself to exhaustion with this frenetic, protracted dance, transported by a fanatical delirium — or rather by a maniacal furor — she jumps before the mirrors, observes her image in them, and emits a loud wail. She threatens herself with the sword, which she moves continuously in her hands, and she directs blows at the walls, the musical instruments, the mirrors, and even at her arms, to the point that she actually sheds blood. During the dance, she often runs to plunge her head and face in the basin's water; her face is inflamed with too much heat and dripping with sweat, and in the water, she rinses herself off impatiently and indignantly. Then she observes herself at length in the water and delights in it with the same ridiculous and insane gesticulations that she had performed in front of the mirrors. Still not content, she throws down the sword furiously and crawls on her knees to the musicians; seizing the magadis or harp by a string and leaning on it with her hands in the musician's manner, she strikes the ground again and again with her knees; she stretches out her neck and rapidly twirls her head with such extreme desperation in her appearance, that those present fear that she suffers from dizziness. After indulging herself with this mimicry, she rises to her feet, led by frenzy, her mind deranged, her cheeks on fire, her eyes red, wandering here and there, running in circles, and sometimes — amazingly enough — she spins around on one foot, whirling until the dizziness, weakness, or unsteady vision due to that movement against the nature of terrestrial bodies, end up precipitating her to the ground head first.

Following the custom of the other tarantati, her dance lasts for three days, and each day it is interrupted three times and begins again three times, always with the same succession of movements we recorded. But on the last day, after having danced in the manner described, as evening falls, the tarantata is immersed in a deep sorrow, as if a thousand troubles weighed upon her soul: for this reason, she goes to bed, her difficult breathing interrupted by continuous sobs, and sheds tears wailing. [She now seems to reject and have an aversion to] the festive decorations, the pleasant and cheerful objects. Thus, she scornfully abandons the multicolor dress and asks insistently for gloomy clothes; the gay and splendid fabrics are torn down from the walls, for she wants dismal and coarse cotton cloths in their place. In the meantime, while the musicians strike up a somber, melancholy melody, she begins a slow dance, measured and serious; her chest shakes again and again with deep sighs, During the dance she is increasingly overcome by adi into desperation, and she goes about striking her che palms; she grabs at her locks after having loosened them from the ribbons tying them, This continues until she is reduced to tears, while the onlookers are all likewise moved to tears, and she falls into a state of Prostration, abandoning her exhausted body to the arms of her handmaids. Nighttime falls, a deep sleep; the next morning she appears restored to her full vigor.°8 This dream of eroticism and death of the noblewoman of Lucera contrasts with the heroic dream mimicked by some ploughmen near the castle of Motta di Montecorvino, according to the account of Domenico Sangenito,* who was an eyewitness to it: In the castle of Motta di Montecorvino, | had the occasion to see five tarantati dance at the same time and inside of the same stockade: they were four ploughmen and a beautiful country lass. The corrected text is as follows:

New things were observed in this union, as each participant had taken an alias, derived from the names of ancient kings. They were related to each other by kinship and treated one another with reciprocal affection, which was observed by the spectators. They happily performed the usual course of dance over three days.

On the last evening, before taking leave, they politely asked for a squadron of men at arms. They were given ten harquebusiers, who were divided in two wings, ready to fire a salvo. They also brought a little powdered salt, which was brought to the ideal King of Kings, whose name was Pietro Bocca. They each took some of this water, bowed deeply, and said: "We will see each other next year."

After so much fatigue, those wretches did not remember a single thing, but in the midst of the multitude of people surrounding them, they only begged to be taken home.

From inship, ht. The chief, or as we might call him, mazza) drew a sign in the water in the signaled to the squadron to leave, and with reference to the variety of situations represented, Kircher states that the tarantati often took on roles of soldiers, captains, governors, boxers, and popular orators.

In particular, with regard to the use of swords, during the dance, some farantati gave themselves over to various gesticulations with unsheathed swords or other types of shining arms, appearing to be highly struck by their luster. Shaking their bodies in various ways, they handled the sword in the right hand, then in the left, throwing it in the air and ably catching it, dropping it on the ground and starting a fist fight, observing all the rules of the art as if they had been trained in public gyms.

Others lay prone or supine on the weapon, murmuring a spell, until – moved by fresh enthusiasm – they rose to their feet and started new combats and new dances, exulting like madmen.

We have already hinted at the meaning of this agonistic theme of the sword: here, we wish to emphasize the variety of representative directions the rite can take. In order to have a concrete image of the diverse ritual possibilities which could occur in the same place and in the same ritual season, let us refer to the vivid description of what happened in Venosa in the summer of 1596, according to what may be gathered from the Dialogo delle Tarantole by the author Sangineto.

In the original text, this author's name appears in some places as “Sangineto.” In the summer of 1596, the ritual was preceded and accompanied by disastrous events: on July 14, a comet appeared in the sky, which was followed by two pillars of fire rising on the horizon to the west on August 11. On August 12, it hailed for four hours with hailstones, and the sky went dark. On August 12, a fowl plague left the coops empty, and in the courtyard of a certain Don Porfido, two geese were seen fighting to the death. The crisis of tarantism had its onset with extreme violence, involving the entire city. One woman, bitten on her foot, sang, composing verses in vernacular and manifested the gift of prophesy. She announced the fate of St. John of Jerusalem, who would face certain woes, which did happen as the knight, named Fra Fabrizio Giustiniano di Nola, was imprisoned by order of His Excellency the Viceroy of Naples, a very harsh measure. The woman further predicted imminent disasters to other women and in fact, shortly thereafter, a Commissioner arrested one of Ser Antonino's sons in regard to rumors about a wounded Spaniard.

A young girl from the Sansovino family danced for two weeks with two swords in her hands and spoke Hebrew, a language unfamiliar to her, thus demonstrating her possession. She danced with swords tied to her feet, another behavior which we have already mentioned. The brother of the maestro Giovanni Antonio di Nola, on orders of the taranta that possessed him, who was called a danced with two swords in his hands all the way to the walls of the convent of Santa Maria della Scala, which housed cloistered nuns; there, he called out the names of some of the nuns with such fervor that it seemed he would die from it. Since the nuns did not answer, the farantato was sent by signora Faustina, the taranta possessing him, to return home, seen waving his swords all the while.

Another tarantato believed in his delirium that he was going to give birth to a baby, and therefore he assumed the gestures of an expectant mother: the people pitied him and gave him a real baby, according to his delirium, which he kept as a son, truly given birth. A daughter of a certain Berardino Sabbatella was possessed by the taranta while she was close to delivery; worn-out from dancing, she fell asleep and dreamed of a stranger who approached her and parceled her out of her sleep, saying, "Wake up, because tomorrow you will give birth!" She asked the stranger who he was, and he answered that he was one of thirty thousand who had come from Egypt, resting in Venosa for a time, then disappeared after entering into godparenthood relations with the master Fonzo Spicchillo, a poor cripple, who had in his home a stringed instrument and a rebec with two strings. During his crisis, he went to his miserable instruments and declared himself to be the nephew of the Duke of Ferrara, Alfonso d'Este, in his delirium, mimicking a concert of invisible organs and harpsichords in front of an audience which had quickly gathered, singing "unintelligible barzellettas."

Episodes of group tarantism were also frequent, in which several persons, sometimes members of the same family, were stimulated by the same fancy, mimicking a common delirium, in which each maintained their role and coordinated it with that of the others, as if in a sort of stage performance. For example, many girls of the house of Fabio Speraindeo danced at length, with swords in their mouths: one Francesca believed herself to be a baroness, and in her delirious make-believe, she performed frenetic dances with a captain, who was either an obliging ally or a tarantato himself. A certain Lalla Gammone believed herself to be a great lady for several days, and she had herself attended by a number of Venosian youths, who carried out meal-time tasks as cup-bearers, stewards, or pageboys. Some sisters, all sarantate, instead recited scenes of religious calling, distributing the parts of disciples and assigning that of mistress to one of their friends. The disciples went to the mistress, communicating their religious calling. One read the Gospel of St. John, announced the collection from the Mass, the Hail Mary, Our Father, the Credo, intoning litanies. Then, having returned home with her sisters, she instructed other tarantate, and all danced together until they fell exhausted to the ground; they did this for several days. In still another case, the roles were evenly distributed between a young servant girl and a little ten-year-old master, who danced for four days, saying "unspeakable things" to each other and hearing orders and warnings from "their lady tarantula" in the musical instrument. Then the tarantula possessing them, named Caterina, ordered them to end the dance and the servant girl to lay down the colored clothes, corals, rings, handkerchiefs with which she had dressed herself in her mania. At this command, the boy stopped dancing, and the servant girl began to take off her ornaments, emphasizing in her song the leave‘ granted by the tarantula, the aid of the Virgin Mary, and the decisive death of the spider: "Signora Caterina, Signora Caterina, give me complete leave. You give me leave, and you, Madonna, have freed me... This is the way I'm cured, drop dead now, die now." (But Bruni adds that along with these almost holy words, the servant girl uttered others which he had never thought possible to hear from the mouth of a "woman child," that is, one still unmarried.) So much variety in the prepared scenery, in the ritual objects used, in the situations mimicked each time, is all in evident relation with the individual conflicts which were poured into the plastic symbol of tarantism on each occasion. The concrete form of these conflicts is obviously impossible to specify from the historical documentation, and it was barely possible to attempt their identification in the ethnographic observation, which had the aid of modern techniques of exploring the unconscious prepared for use in the peasant world of the Salento, where tarantism still survives.

In the Italian original, "estro" means "fancy," "whim," "estrus," but also "gadfly," which as we will see in Chapter 15, bears a historical and etymological relationship to tarantism. "La concessa licenza," which means that the taranta had given the participants leave, but a second meaning of "granted licentiousness" should also be kept in mind, considering De Martino's analysis below.

THE RITUAL IN ACTION AND INDIVIDUAL SYMBOLISM 121

Although it is possible to indicate some general characteristics of the individual conflicts that tarantism was, from one time to the next, called upon to deal with, it is necessary to proceed with caution, at least in the current state of research. It is possible to glean the nature of the conflicts which underlay the tarantism of Venosa in 1596. The brother of Master Antonio di Campagna must have nursed a frustrated desire for one of the nuns of the convent of San Vitale, which was socially accepted and symbolically ordered, and he was able to place himself below the walls of the convent and shout out the names of women who could not answer, who were thought to be dead; after having shouted those names in vain, as if from the front, he attacked the tarantula agonistically waving his swords. The Head of the Tarantism, the Servant Girl, and Little Mimic

The daughter, which in effect bit into the obscure depths
of their unconscious, received notice of the affair
of Berardino Sabatella, near to where one ake!
ent in dream and the pause of her dance, an i Peccarthly event of her motherhood by making a er of ee i aracter: 4 who belonged to a host of thirty thousand:
characters, in the magical land of power.

The tailor Fonzo Sansa is a campan and i is mi tic instruments;
he also takes part in the destiny of his miserable rustic
life in the city of Venosa, reciting his fair of remorse
that was rampant in the fulfilled men on earth.

Analogously, the musician at the court of one of the most powerful
Arabs for a we can tell from the report which Domenico made
in the castle of Motta di Montec the ploughmen and country
lasses, sitting in imaginary aristocratic kinship in their figures,
taking on mimicking imaginary aristocratic kinship in their figures,
receiving the harquebusie: ancient kings, they laid down their arms
and on a ee i lar memories of remote passages.

This dream, perhaps elaborated with popular elements,
from the Holy Land which took place from Apulian ports,
it was a transformation for the lowly ploughman Pietro Boccamazza
to rise to the a of au es mie i in his life.

To this gallery of figures from the past, we must
add the tarantata Latina, celebrating her poor condition
in front of the Chapel of Saint Paul in Galatina,
amazing the crowd divided into two groups,
viewing them with a militaristic countenance.

The mythical-ritual symbol of tarantism
is the evocation, release in such a way as to offer
a horizon for the individual conflicts produced
by the pressure that a tee existential regime —
was exercised by the social order, in various ways
by the familial order, by customs, and by the adversities
of life.

Foremost among these con' tents is an eros that has been
transformed or by the adversities of life, in various ways
by the familial order, by customs, and by the adversities
of life.

The participants in tarantism have always mostly been
bonafide members of the working class, including those
belonging to higher social classes.

The recurrent theme of forestry, leafy fronds, vine leaves,
gurgling springs; the predominance of ivy in the tarantula's
symbolism, represents the predominance of the individual
symbolism.

In the tale of Lucera described by Domenico,
which gave him relief, a priest was bitten by the tarantula
and forced to dance. When Valleta felt the sting,
he replied that, as oppressed by the music, the mu
sical sadness, he was consoled by the gurgling
of clear waters and meeting with the participants
in the dance.

But as night fell, he could no longer participate
in the tarantata, and the group disbanded.
The priest, feeling the solitude, sank in deep
melancholy and remained closed in a tenacious silence.

In the historical literature, there was also the story
of an Apulian priest who took pleasure in having
sleeping girls stung by the tarantula, so that he
might secretly enjoy the resulting languor,
reawakening the stung girl's senses.

On the other hand, Epifanio Ferdinando,
in his quest for variety and chastity, did not want
to have priests and nuns participate in the musical
exorcism, resulting in their prey to malignant
illnesses. "In which the medieval color symbolism was associated with new love; the frenetic dance to the rhythm of the tarantella and the role-play of a splendidly dressed bride; the songs of love that is dead or in agony and the desire for the Sea; the groaning reshaped in funeral laments; exorcisms of the taranta that bit the genitals; denuding and obscene exhibitions; and finally, some moves on the floor during the dance of the little spider which could be the equivalent of positioning and rhythms of an imaginary coitus: all of this form an order of possible symbolic horizons of recovery and release, through which the tarantate sought to give a voice and dreamy gesture to the obscure libertine drives tormenting them.

Moreover, for the more blatantly aggressive aspects of this drive, tarantism, also offered the chromatic horizon of red and swords to handle, in whose luster, the tarantata could contemplate her own image as if in a mirror. In this way, women of every stratum who were condemned by custom to a harsh regime of erotic frustrations!3_— young girls at puberty, widows, unhappy wives, spinsters with withered loves — found in tarantism’s cultural order certain possibilities to release in the symbolic production what the social pressure had confined to the menacing enclosures of the unconscious.

With particular zeal Pauperae et pauperculae mulieres [poor and wretched women] participated in these “little carnivals of women”: urged by sex, and awaiting the period of their dreams, they went about accumulating as much money as possible, only to squander it on the great day'™ when they would draw a little Tustic paradise of music, dance and colors out of their pain and anguish.

A second order of conflicts which involved both sexes was in relation to the frustrations of poverty and a weak social condition. With regard to these conflicts, in addition to the symbols of red and the radiance of arms, tarantism offered the possibility of mimicking scenes of greatness and power, of success and glory: each person could thus elevate his own fate just as much as life had actually lowered it, and he lived out episodes whose form inverted his own obscure existence. The green paradise of dreamed love had its opposite in a paradise in red, an agonistic spirit which sought to mimic heroic poses, the dream of being one of the great men of the earth, an athlete, physically fit, a captain, a tribune, a court artist, a King of Kings.

On the same horizon of strength and prestige, of power and ability, appeared the pretense to unveil hidden treasures, to communicate the names of persons never before met, to predict the future — all attested in the earliest literature.'5

Finally, priests and others who suffered from the frustration of the cloister were sometimes won over to tarantism. The bishop of Polignano, Giovan Battista Quinzato, had himself bitten by the tarante to show his Polignanesi that they were harmless, but he too fell prey to the crisis of tarantism and was fortunately cured by the music and dance."

A certain Nicola Perrone, a priest at Campi in the Salento, was at home when he was sank into the characteristic melancholy of the tarantati. He heard the music in the street which accompanied the Holy Sacrament carried about in Procession: he went to the door to watch mysterium illud adorandi causa [that mystery for adoration], but with the beatific vision and the sounds becoming more insistent, his face lost color, and he started shaking and sighing. Then, with things having taken a turn for the worse, he called the musicians and had himself “explored. The right melody was found, and he 13 The Symbol of the Taranta

The taranta forms the hegemonic symbol, the unifying myth of the entire symbolic order of tarantism. The music, dance, colors, forest, springs, mirrors, swords, ropes and swings, seasonal symbolism: all of these have their center of coordination and unification in the taranta, the fundamental norm of their coherence. Now we must examine the structure of this hegemonic symbol of tarantism more closely, on the basis of historical documentation.

The poisoning taranta can have various sizes and colors, and she has preferences for this or that color; she is sensitive to various melodies, and her bite is melodic; her dance follows the rhythm and melody congenial to her; her bite communicates corresponding inclinations to the victim; the bite instills a poison into their veins which lasts as long as the taranta lives, and its effect is extinguished when the sarantato, through the dance's agonistic identification, makes the poisoning beast "drop dead." The taranta bites in the summer season, but it is possible that the bite suffered during one summer gets rekindled in successive summers, "re-biting": this is the sign that the taranta is still alive (or that she has passed on her legacy to her sisters, daughters or granddaughters, as we see from the ethnographic fieldwork, but not from the historical literature). The 'aranta sometimes bears the name of a person, her name is "signora Faustina" or "signora Caterina," or even simply "signora tarantula." In the Calabrian exorcism mentioned above, she gives orders to the tarantato, dialogues and makes deals with him; the ethnographic fieldwork also confirmed this. As a person, she has her own character and proclivities: there are in fact tarante who communicate lascivious behavior, heroic ones who solicit mimes of power and glory, and there are also melancholy ones who ask for funeral laments. In short, the saranta acts just like a Possessing "spirit" that is controlled by exorcism.

In this regard, Valletta does not hesitate to suspect that many among the Apulian tarantati are "possessed by the devil,"?! and recalls the case of a farantata upon whom canonical exorcisms were useless, and who was instead cured with dance and music: -.. There were two other priests together with me to attend the Performance, and we all concurred that it was a case of possession, therefore we began to practice exorcisms. But while we were busy doing so, a musician chanced to pass by playing his instrument. Then, suddenly, the woman got out from under our control, and as if seized by an insane frenzy, she ran out of the house dancing in an unseemly manner and followed the musician. Having realized what had happened, the latter stopped in his tracks and interrupted his playing. Then the woman, as if struck down, fell to the ground lifeless. In the meantime, her family had left the house, and they asked the musician to begin playing his music again. He complied, and the woman rose to her feet immediately, restored to her full Nonetheless, before the topic even became the object of interest on the part of doctors and naturalists, we find some hints at a strictly symbolic evaluation in the high culture of the 1400s and 1500s, though only in a limited manner. In one of the da Vinci manuscripts, we read this concise note: ‘The bite of the taranta maintains a man in his intention, that is, whatever he was expecting when he was bitten.’ Da Vinci does not consider this note to be one of his discoveries, because it is included in a collection in which animals are only briefly mentioned and pinned to a moment of their behavior which symbolizes a moral ideal or a passion. Thus, the calandrius is a symbol of virtue, because it turns its gaze away from the sick man who must die and fixes it upon one who will heal; the beaver is a symbol of peace, since it is hunted for the medicinal properties of its testicles, in order to bring peace, it tears them off with its teeth and leaves them to its enemies; the wolf is a symbol of greed, because it stays thin for fear of running out of food; the basilisk is a symbol of cruelty, because when its angry glance is not able to kill animals, it is turned upon grass and plants to make them wither; the phoenix is the symbol of perseverance, because it always endures the flames which consume it and it is always born again; and so on. Connections of this sort, indifferent to the distinction between mythical and real animals and the observation of their actual behavior, obviously do not belong to the field of coherence and objectivity which is inherent to natural science, but to the field of symbolic interpretation of the animal world, which, in the case of da Vinci’s notes, is linked to the mythical traditions of the ancient world and medieval bestiaries.

We are not given the direct source da Vinci drew upon in compiling this rapid note on the bite of the taranta, but it is nonetheless certain that the relative tradition was already well known and that it circulated in the de venenis literature. In a treatise of this title written between 1424 and 1426 by Ardoynis of Pisa, we find a reference to the ideology which held that as long as the poison of the taranta remains intact, the melancholy of those who were bitten persists with that imagination, inclination, and thought in which they found themselves at the moment of the bite. But in de Ardoynis, the symbolic connection of da Vinci simply appears as a remark regarding one of the astonishing properties of taranta poison: in his De venenis, Ponzetti attempts to furnish a mechanical explanation of this property within the framework of knowledge in that period. According to Ponzetti, the poison of the taranta is introduced with a bite on the skin, and through the nerves it reaches the brain. There, because of its earthen and parched quality, it acts as an impediment and blocks thoughts and intentions, forcing the victim to remain in the state he was in at the moment of the bite. With this imaginative mechanical explanation, Ponzetti attempts to account for the behavior of the tarantati—who dance or mimic scenes of greatness and social preeminence—by observing that dance, song, and visions of power and glory make up the thoughts and intentions peasants most frequently indulge in, so as to obtain relief from their fatigues. This would explain why in tarantism—which mostly strikes peasants—intentions of this sort are manifested in preference to others, lasting until, with the end of the poison’s action, the intentions and thoughts are unblocked and resume their normal course. In later authors, this singular characteristic of tarantism, less and less understood in a symbolic sense and increasingly linked to the field of naturalistic knowledge, begins to get called into doubt and suspected of being a popular legend. In the De venenis of Gerolamo Mercuriale, among "the astonishing accidents" provoked by the bite of the taranta, we again find mention of this alleged persistence of the sentiment or action involved in at the moment of the "first bite," so that "if [the taranta] bites someone walking, he will always walk, if dancing, he will always dance, if laughing, he will always laugh," However, the author quickly adds — "if this is true, I dare not assert it, although those who know Apulia do assert it as certain,!" Some forty years later, the - Salentine doctor Epifanio Ferdinando, in his Centum observations, picks back up this same tradition from Gerolamo Mercuriale, but he qualifies it as popular opinion with no basis, circulated by learned men who let themselves be fooled "a mulierculis et terrae Siliis," by little women and peasants.'" But the Salentine doctor also accepts a somewhat related tradition without comment, according to which the tarantati do not cease to dance unless they are led back to the place where they had their first bite, where "mira Jaciunt, adeo corpus variis et inordinatis motionibus exagitant [they do astonishing things, shaking their bodies with various and disorderly movements].!° Gerolamo Marciano of Leverano, another Salentine physician who was a contemporary of Epifanio Ferdinando, also declares that he had never been able to directly observe this blocking power of the tarantula's bite in his twenty years' practice as a doctor, nor had he ever heard talk of it from musicians and doctors in the Salento, though he admits that others in the province of Otranto claimed to have seen it.' After Epifanio Ferdinando, this traditional characteristic of tarantism loses importance in the accounts: neither Baglivi nor Valletta mentions it, nor Serao, Only Caputo touches briefly on the subject, in order to recall Marciano's skeptical opinion. '*! In general, from the 1700s on, with the prevailing medical-naturalistic interest in tarantism and the consequent devaluation of ideological and cultural aspects of the phenomenon, mention of this characteristic is left out of the writings devoted to the subject, either because it passed unnoticed by eyewitnesses or because it seemed popular superstition, not worthy of being recorded by men THE SYMBOL OF THE TARANTA 127 * ecjence. But in the historical-cultural and historical-religious perspective aq ; consider tarantism here, this singular tradition returns to bear patie val sis and evaluation, precisely in the form in which Leonardo da . Rareed it for us — as a mythical symbol. If tarantism is a myth-ritual aa hich the "taranta," the "bite," the "poison" and the choreutic-musical ony re all in a vibrant symbolic animation, da Vinci's symbol can be ad. nd understood on its own level. In other words, and more explicitly: a al of tarantism's own mythical-ritual symbolism, it is possible to find 7. tial roots of the symbolic horizon of the taranta bite that "keeps man Be intention that is, what he was thinking when he was bitten." In effect, oe tite of the faranta" and the "poison" are mythical images wings tism gives a symbolic horizon to unconscious psychic conflicts, ei remembrance and for resolving choice. For this Teason (to paraphrase Se vinci note in modern terms), they keep a man tied toa critical no episode, in the sense that the episode returns indefinitely, asserting itself as a : rotic symptom. Faced with this risk, tarantism is deployed above Ss cyoum of exploring and shaping the crisis, a system <o.

In this SS some variations on the tradition preserved for us by da Vinci take on new C. Ich th - meaning. We may consider, for example, the ideology according to which the tarantato, in order to recover, must return to the se where he re: an a 'i i killed.'

128 THE LAND OF REMORSE people, because while other men have no excuses for their follies, the Apulians always have one ready: that is, the tarantula to whose bite they attribute their insane desires, giving free play to them under a semblance of honesty. And Compatre, who then has his turn to speak, continues by recalling how the Apulians believe that the spiders' poison can have various effects, and that there are so-called 'concupiscent' spiders who stimulate women to eroticism (just as with the 'libertine tarantula' we found even today in the Salento during our fieldwork in 1959), The women, continues Compatre, are often bitten by this spider, and when this happens it is permissible and suitable for them to approach men freely and with impunity, there being no other way to dissolve the poison afflicting them; so, with this excuse of the tarantula, what would be shameful and immodest actions for others becomes for them a remedy, 'Doesn't this seem to you to be great happiness?' asks Compatre, and the other replies: 'By Priapus, very great!'3 The humanist's malice aside, a grain of truth makes its first appearance here, despite being casually thrown into quite a different context, and it does not matter if the interpretation attributed to Panormita one-sidedly emphasizes the erotic content which finds a symbolic horizon in the 'taranta.' This grain of truth gets lost in the approach adopted subsequently in research conducted by doctors like Epifanio Ferdinando and Baglivi: in fact,______ Baglivi, who essentially considered tarantism in this perspective, asserts only in a subordinate and secondary way the fact that the women sometimes “simulate” their symptoms in order to take advantage of the opportunity offered by the musical cure, and in this way give free rein to their passions: among these, Baglivi gives primacy to the “licks of the flame of love” harbored at length in the almost cloistered Segregation imposed by custom, without the possibility of conducting even a mere honest conversation with Persons of the other sex. Baglivi also considers family disasters and a world-weariness which, assiduously corroding the soul, can easily degenerate into desperation and melancholy. To complete the picture, he adds the fierce heat of the Apulian summer, spicy foods, the sensuality of local temperament and the idleness of daily life.'34 As we can see, what was central to Pontano’s interpretation becomes secondary in that of Baglivi: for the Dalmatian physician, authentic tarantism is no longer a custom that has its motivations, but a disease caused by the bite of a poisonous spider, which gets mixed up with an inauthentic tarantism of “little carnivals of women.”

We may now attempt to place the results of the analysis of the historical literature and the fieldwork in a unified perspective and consider how it might be legitimate to speak of tarantism as a religion of remorse. With the word “remorse,” we usually mean the biting recollection of a wrong decision and the need for a reparatory choice which wipes out the debt incurred with ourselves and others. In remorse understood this way, the wrong decision lies squarely at the forefront of memory, and we know exactly what we are remorseful of, even if it is not always possible for us to satisfy the need for a reparation “down to the last penny.” In the crisis of tarantism, there is instead an unresolved conflict - from THE SYMBOL OF THE TARANTA 129 ‘| indivi ence has remained imprisoned; lost to resolving ene ens tid up as a closed, ciphered symptom removed eon er of decision or choice.

Historical Commentary
14. Parallels in Ethnology and Folklore

The naturalistic reduction of tarantism to disease, our fieldwork, and the analysis of the historical literature have supported the phenomenon's cultural significance. With this, however, the historical discourse has only just begun. The fieldwork and the analysis of the literature have given us an image of tarantism that is primarily static, bearing no relation to anything else and disconnected from the religious and cultural life of the South, despite its specific localization in Southern Italy and in Apulia. Nevertheless, as we face the problem of rescuing tarantism from the incoherent isolation to which the fieldwork and the analysis of the historical literature have temporarily condemned it, the risk of a naturalistic reduction of the phenomenon again looms on the horizon, this time in the double form of a "reduction to type" and a "reduction to antecedents."

The danger of a "reduction to type" arises from the adaptation to consider tarantism as a particular case within a vast class of phenomena drawn from the most diverse cultural complexes, living or not, a class we might call "lower mystical forms," "ecstatic cults," "possession ritual," and "naristic-type ceremonies." The danger of a "reduction to antecedents" arises instead from the temptation to consider tarantism as a "relic" or "survival" of corresponding elements that can be traced to the classical world, or more likely, to religious civilizations in the ancient world. Although we must avoid these two reductions so as to keep tarantism from disappearing into a vague antecedent, the comparison with similar phenomena and the search for ancient antecedents are in and of themselves beyond criticism. On the contrary, they are indispensable for identifying the historical originality of tarantism as a new formation irreducible to something else, a minor religious phenomenon that — as we shall see — developed in the Middle Ages and shared the cultural life of Southern Italy and Western civilization.

In the ongoing relationship with this particular problem of historiographic identification, both the comparison with similar phenomena and the search for ancient antecedents justify their usefulness; we must therefore guarantee the necessary vigilance so that an indiscriminate comparativism and a perspective-free philologism do not 'Up make the historical meaning of the phenomenon under investigation "appear into the indistinct and the generic.*

The double direction of the analysis — that is, in the direction of ethnological 'folkloric parallels and that of ancient antecedents —has a point of connection in the pages which Jeanmaire has dedicated to some African parallels in order to a Gallini (1986) offers a lucid discussion of De Martino's comparative method in La "ra del Rimorso and his other ethnographic works: see "Metodo comparative e studio delle miche culturali," La Ricerca Folklorica, n. 13, pp. 31-38. In Polem] [the rather tumultuous beginning of Our ical parallels in Order tg cal antiquity, Jeanmaire Mediterranean identified, molecular josed to centuries-old influences which we may generically call “Afro-Mediterranean,” especially with the rapid expansion of Islam from the seventh century on. In his analysis of Greek mania and maenadi group of African cults which are structurally similar, possessing demons and choreutic- The area of diffusion of these cults is found in Tripolitania, Tunisia), the Arab sm, Jeanmaire examines a related (zar, bori, etc.), featuring musical treatment of the Possession, including — at least on the basis of the ~ the Islamic countries of North Africa (Egypt, Libyan Peninsula, Ethiopia and a significant part of the Sudanese world, beginning with the Lower Niger basin. In addition to the - area indicated by Jeanmaire, we must consider the historically dependent area of the Afro-American world (the Afro-Brazilian, Afro-Cuban and Afro-Haitian areas), where structurally similar cults have developed with particular means, taking on their names of their own (macumba, condomblé, santeria, voodoo).

We cite here the entire description that Jeanmaire has given of such cults: They are practices of a popular sort, performed by elements belonging to the lowest strata of the population without being limited to them, especially in regard to the female population. We are in the presence of disciples who service a particular cult not to a principal divinity, but to a host of hierarchically-ordered spirits. These spirits manifest themselves through the state of Possession during séances given by the congregations. This state is accompanied by consecutive trances into which the disciple falls, and it is translated into frenetic dances to which the Possessed person abandons himself. Moreover, this is a state whose appearance and disappearance are prepared and provoked, to a certain extent on command, by appropriate gymnastics (in general with oscillations and spins of the torso and head) and also by the Suggestion of determined rhythms.

During the séance given by the group (more or less open to the public), the possessing spirit makes itself known — or is recognized and identified by the director of the practices — by behaviors of the Possessed subject, by the type of steps he performs or by the melody that accompanies this ecstatic dance. The possessed Person and the possessing spirit may be of the same sex or different sex (and, additionally, a same subject can be Possessed in the state of trance by spirits of different sexes). For the assistants and the participants, the dancer is always the possessing spirit, not the Possessed person, whether man or woman; one This violent agitation is generally followed by a state of prostration, together with what seems to be a more or less total amnesia of what "has taken place. The familiar spirits in relationships with the disciples are manifested to them in two ways: they torment them, provoking pathological disturbances of various sorts, generally nervous, and it is also during these disorders that the sufferers enter into relations with them; or else they become possessed through contagion or during a séance attended. But warned, instructed and indoctrinated by the head of the sect, they have been reconciled to the said spirit, on the condition of certain practices of the cult, sacrifices and especially gifts, whereby a state of relative calm and — follows for the patient. The calm is relative in the sense that = and this is an essential point - the séance organized in different circumstances gives rise to trance phenomena in which the spirits are manifested taking possession of their riding horse. In a proper, which is practiced in an environment in which Possession is understood as the effect of the intrusion of a naturally maleficent spirit, the exorcism tends to expel the evil entity. In the (supposed or suggested) states of possession considered here, however, < may correctly characterize the process by observing that the method of treatment used aims not so much to suppress the affective and delirious states, as rather to transform such states through the elimination of their depressive factor and utilize them in view of creating a new equilibrium of the personality. This equilibrium is achieved by virtue of a form of symbiosis with the possessing spirit, who is transformed into a protecting spine, and by virtue of a normalization of the crisis state in the form of the trance provoked, Some considerable affinities with tarantism — though also important differences — emerge from this necessarily generic description: the limitation of the phenomenon to popular classes, the broad female participation, the Coexistence with higher forms of religious life (Christianity, Islam) and the Syncretistic combinations resulting from it, the choreutic-musical therapy of the crisis, the variety of characters and inclinations of the possessing spirit ~ which recalls the “libertine,” “tempestuous” or “sad and silent” taranta of tarantism — the relationship between spirit and type of music and choreutic behavior associated with its manifestation. In the case of tarantism, the original telationship with latrodectism, the influence of the Christian conception of diabolic possession and the syncretistic confusion with Catholic Saints have all undoubtedly mitigated the transformation of the taranta into a protecting Spirit” along the lines of the Sudanese bori or the Ethiopian and Egyptian Zar. Even here, however, and especially in the earliest forms of tarantism, the dialogues and bargaining with the taranta, the powers of clairvoyance obtained from her, the amiable setting of the ritual, and the zeal with which, upon the approach of the ceremonial season, the women submitted themselves to food taboos and sexual abstinences, putting aside savings — all seem to suggest a relationship which cannot be traced to the theme of “driving out the evil spirit,” but instead one that is more akin to the “transformation of depressive factors” and “normalization of the crisis” that Jeanmaire notes as traits of African practices he examines. Other and more specific structural affinities barely emerge from the lack of precision of an overall description; to the analysis of the details of the single cults. Thus, Sacred tree where choreutic performances took place, which were then resumed in the home of the possessed person: this corresponds to the ritual setting, the earliest forms of tarantism. In the zar practices of Northern Ethiopia, the ground where the choreutic-musical therapy takes place reeds, with evident affinities to the arboreal decorations of the room where the tarantati dance, in an imitation, as Caputo noted explicitly, “of a forest setting,” with each “spirit” having a preferred color, with which the possessed person must establish a controlled relationship with the spirit — that is, according to the desired time, place, and means.

In the Abyssinian tiger, as we see from the description of a particular episode of crisis, we find precisely the risis immersed in a stupefying immobility, the intervention of the music, the slow opening of the body to signs of the possessed person’s approval when the music increased, and disapproval when it diminished. The choreutic-musical therapy is typical of tarantism: a woman in crisis dancing with the rhythm and the dance, intensity of the rhythm increasing as the music was interrupted to let the musicians rest.

Due to the abundance of documentary material available, cults of Western Africa can be compared to the new situation. They are, just like the bori and the zar, entitles during ceremonies which take place in the equivalent of the single arbres-voodoo ceremony, offering an image of this cult that justifies the comparison with Apulian tarantism. The rooms of the sanctuary perform the function of a backstage area or dressing rooms for a theater where the possessed find, according to the role they embody, whatever they need for their “impersonation.” This recalls the clothes, jewels, necklaces, the mirror, swords, and other objects.

According to Métraux, the arbres-reposoirs are sacred trees surrounding the humfo, or voodoo temple, which have a role in the initiation ritual. The poteau-mitan is described by Métraux as a center post in the humfo serving as a pivot for ritual dance. In a description of bor practices in Nigeria, we see how the person in crisis, dressed in white, after a secret initiation ceremony in the presence of two godfathers, was led to a place strewn with leaves. It is particularly instructive to compare tarantism to the voodoo cult, which, as is well known, developed in Haiti among the popular classes, readapting the old corresponding spirits of voodoo, the /oa, which manifest themselves through possession. The /oa are associated with reposoirs which surround the sanctuary; the poteau-mitan, a pole with a stone base erected in the center of the peristyle, which represents the route of entrance and exit for the spirits, can itself be considered the symbolic equivalent of the single arbres-voodoo ceremony. The concrete performance of the possessed person's part in the ritual constitutes the act of attention and playing the part of a supernatural being, feared and respected. The /oa, associated with specific evocative musical distinct dances and particular colors, characterize the behavior of the ssed person in various ways. Thus, for example, when the warrior loa Ogu os impersonated, the possessed person places a red scarf around his neck and her scarves of the same color around his arms; he assumes the language and o! of a soldier, performs dangerous exercises with a sword and simulates e pat. The “red cloth” mentioned by Epifanio Ferdinando must have been combat. : wmething similar, likewise, something of this sort must have taken place in 0 ‘he form of possession in which, according to Kircher’s account, the tarantati re sensitive to the color red and the luster of arms and found eee ee eable.° If Ogu seems connected with the “tempestuous aol bee Joa of female coquettishness and the arts of seduction, may be iin! e - jbertine taranta” and to those recurrent behaviors of the tarantate in whic : id wedding dress, an eccentric toilette, contemplation in the genre : ivious displays have a preponderant role.

Analogously, ~au- accumulated to celebrate her annual cult remind us of the savings that, as Baglivi says, the Apulian women put aside to hold their “little carnivals” properly inthe ceremonial season. Certainly, the structural and functional affinities between voodoo and tarantism should not make us forget the differences: in contrast to the relative mythical and ceremonial richness of the many Haitian loa, We have what we may call the single Joa of tarantism — the taranta — with her fundamental theme of the “bite” and the “poison,” and with her specification’ . as libertine,” “tempestuous,” “sad and silent,” or with her cover names and characters (signora Faustina, etc.), which never reached — as far as we knoW ~— the autonomy of distinct mythical traditions. Additionally, in tarantism we PARALLELS IN ETHNOLOGY AND FOLKLORE 183 sd neither sanctuaries nor priests, nor initiation congregations, at least from the documents tell us: though, to attenuate this difference, we should not the importance which the therapeutic musicians must have had in the both in the diagnosis and in the treatment. In seventeenth-century Taranto, he musicians were public officials paid with regular salaries, and even in 1876 ., counted prestigious figures like Francesco Mazzotta of Novoli, whom De ‘mone describes as the blind violinist traveling from village to village to treat antati. However important, though, the differences are not so great as to le us from considering the two phenomena — voodoo and tarantism — as historically comparable, because their structural and functional affinities and n their differences appear as parallel and independent developments arising m a common cultural heritage. Moreover, the comparison between tarantism and the African cults like bori or zar and the Afro-American cults known as macumba, condomblé, anteria and voodoo, is particularly interesting from another point of view, ause these cults — as in tarantism — have been judged by a naturalistic interpretation that has “reduced” them to disease. Looking again at the case of "oodoo," the initial interpretation of neurosis proposed by J.C. Dorsainvil has now been followed by a more balanced evaluation oriented in a historical-cultural direction. Métraux underlines the psychopathological nature of the "al phase" of the crisis, but at the same time demonstrates the controlled, organized, culturally meaningful character and psychological resolution that trance assumes when a certain "loa" emerges and acts in the possessed, with a traditional model of behavior faithfully followed by the possessed person. As Métraux himself puts it:

"Possession cannot be explained solely in terms of psychopathology. Possession probably has that character only in a limited number of individuals who are most certainly true neurotics, subject to what is called split personality... Possession rituals have frequently been attributed to hysterical disorders, but some twenty years ago Herskovits rejected this interpretation, noting the controlled and stylized appearance of the phenomenon and its frequency in a society where it is a normal means of relating with supernatural Powers...

Unlike the hysteric, who reveals her anguish and desires through a "symptom" — an individual means of expression - the ritually-possessed person must confirm the classic image of a mythical character... Voodoo practitioners distinguish possession by a loa from possession by evil spirits, which is fearful and morbid. Trance may thus be a psychological mechanism which is useful to the group's mental health and which avoids the variety and multiplicity of forms that neurosis and psychoses take on in our own Society...

For its practitioners, voodoo effects an escape from a reality which is all too often sordid; it is an institution which "functions." All of this poses the problem of establishing the means by which this institution "functions" or "has functioned" in the past, which is possible only through a historical science that not only poses problems of the origin and development of the mythical-ritual symbols, but also extends its analysis to include the conflicts for which those symbols acted as a horizon of release and cultural reintegration.

The African and Afro-American ethnological parallels of tarantism are not the only ones that, in a historical perspective of investigation, serve to remove this phenomenon from its Apulian isolation and place it within a wider network of cultural relations. It is possible, in fact, to utilize the folkloric-religious parallels for the same ends: similar phenomena which can be traced in the minor teligio; ui life of rural European plebs. The folkloric area where such phenomena occur is circumscribed to the Western Mediterranean, and especially to Sardinia and the Iberian peninsula, where it is possible to observe their remnants through the modern and contemporary eras.

Whereas in the ethnological parallels, the affinities with tarantism concerned the choreutic-musical therapy of a possession, the means of some symbolisms and the analogy of the existent functions, in the Sardinian and Iberian folkloric parallels, the affinities involve the very theme of music and dance as an exorcism for the poisoning bite of mythically shaped animal species. Unfortunately, the documentation on a "Sardinian and Iberian tarantism" is too fragmentary to permit an in-depth comparison with Apulian tarantism. Here, we limit ourselves to a comparative evaluation with Sardinian "tarantism," the subject of an investigation in the winter of 1960, based on questionnaires by our students in the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Education at the University of Cagliari. From this study, we examined thirty villages of the island, obtaining data that, despite their summary and provisional character, were sufficient for an initial orienting comparison. Just as with the Apulian taranta, the Sardinian argia is a mythical animal that we would seek in vain to reduce to a definite natural species, precisely because the widow argia, symbolically associated with the color black, always requires funeral lament. The exorcism is carried out by musicians and dancers, while the poisoned victim gets buried to his neck in manure or placed in a hole to be filled with earth, or else is left on the ground seized by crisis: in this last case, his participation in the dance may or may not take place.

The exorcising corps of dancers is made up of unmarried girls (or bachelors), married women (or married men) and widows (or widower), representing the three possible types of argia, and the musical exploration to determine the type in question in a given case subsequently takes place with choreutic-musical themes and songs traditionally associated with each type. The maidens, with their behavior, occur primarily in the summer months and do not give rise to seasonal repetitions in the crisis—cure connection. Sometimes the exorcising practices have been oriented toward a therapy which has nothing to do with the music and dance, as in the case of the practice of placing the poisoned victim in a warm oven.

Among the numerous local variants, the one related by an informant from Ossi is of particular interest:

PARALLELS IN ETHNOLOGY AND FOLKLORE 185

The spirits of dead people transmigrate in the argia, always female and always in one of the three conditions of maiden, wife or widow. Through the bite, the spirit passes to the victim, always male, who therefore will be possessed by a maiden, a wife or a widow, playing the corresponding role in the ritual — that is, taking on female dress and behaving according to the aspirations and mood thought to be characteristic of each of the three fundamental existential situations of a woman. To determine the type of possession, the customary musical exploration is conducted, until the poisoned victim's satisfaction decides the subsequent orientation of the ceremony.

If the possession is by a maiden, the poisoned victim displays his satisfaction, reacting to the corresponding musical treatment choosing a dancer among those present and beginning a choreutic cycle which ends after a while by falling to the ground, only to begin again after a brief interval under the renewed stimulus of the music. The behavior of the wife sometimes imitates that of an expectant mother, indulged in this by those present, who call for a midwife. In other cases, someone possessed by the argia-wife even behaves like a new mother, and in this case, too, those present indulge the poisoned victim by giving him a doll to nurse and caress.

Finally, in the case of the widow, the victim possessed by her plays the role of the widow who laments her dead husband, while those present make up the chorus of the funerary lament. In the phase of musical exploration, exorcisms of this sort are sung:

Franziscu Paullesu / adi scrittu a Bosa / pro S. Bibbiana: / Franziscu Paullesu / naramie una cosa / fiuda esti o bagiana / cussa chi t'adi offesu?
(Francesco Paullesu, | wrote to Bosa, to St. Bibbiana: Francesco Paullesu, tell me, is the one who bit you a widow or a maiden?). These data regarding the Sardinian argia, because of limits in the means of ‘collecting them, leave many points vague for our aim of comparison with Apulian tarantism. On the basis of these data, in fact, we cannot decide what the relationship is between the practices and ideologies of argia and real forms of arachnidism, and thus we cannot measure, as we have done for tarantism, the degree of symbolic autonomy of the corresponding mythical-symbol. In particular, lacking detailed analysis, we cannot grasp the ical existential meaning underlying the ideology of the maiden, wife and widow argia. Nevertheless, the structural affinities with tarantism are evident, as demonstrated by the common elements of the poisoning bite and the choreutic-musical exorcism, the musical exploration of the poisoned victim, the diverse approaches taken by the ceremony in relation to the quality of the argia responsible for the poisoning, and even some traces of chromatic “symbolism.

Those poisoned by the argia-wife simulating pregnancy and new motherhood closely recall the corresponding case of Venosa in the summer of 15964 when a tarantato mimicked the role of an expectant mother, indulged in this by those present who gave him a real infant, which the tarantato took to care for as his own son. But there are some features which also emerge which do not have any counterpart in Apulian tarantism: for example, the largely Male participation in the crises and the ceremonial treatment; the absence of the aquatic-arboreal scenery; the lack of seasonal repetition in the crisis—cure Nexus; the ceremony of burial in manure or the placement of the victim in a Warm oven; the ideology of the maiden, wife and widow; the character which Here, in the original, there is a typographical error transposing the date’s numbers in 1956; De Martino is referring to the case of Venosa discussed in Chapter 12.

Metaphors aside, must now consider the classical antecedents of Apulian tarantism: those es which have a counterpart in Greek religious life, of which Apulia, as of Magna Grecia, was a cultural province. The symbolism of the bite, the arboreal and aquatic setting, the swing, the mirror, the sword and the oreutic-musical catharsis are all found in the Greek religious world according essentially analogous mythical-ritual structures and functions which recall e of tarantism and form its historical antecedents. Our analysis can begin with the central theme of Apulian tarantism: the symbolism of the bite. In the Greek world, a first indication in favor of symbolism of this sort comes from the medical-literary and scholarly genre concerning animal bites and their effects on man, which enjoyed particular favor from the Hellenistic age on.* The mere fact that a literature of this sort could have developed and had success suggests a magical-religious legacy where an emotional judgment prevails of animals that bite and poison, be they spiders, snakes, or rabid dogs.

In the description furnished by Nicandro of the consequences of the phalangid’s bite, for which a gleaner is at risk,* the modern historian of medicine might recognize a more or less precise and probable clinical picture of arachnidism (tremors, convulsions, delirium, priapism, etc.). However, when Philumenos reports that if one approaches someone bitten by a phalangid, he risks falling into the same crisis as the victim,* the historian of religious life cannot help but think of the type of symbolic relations in Apulian tarantism defined as the “imitation of the behavior of the poisoned victim,” which are actually susceptible to psychic contagion and cultural shaping according to certain traditions.

Similarly, when Nicandro draws a relationship between the color of the scorpion and the effects of its bite, speaking of a white scorpion which is harmless, a red one which creates fever and thirst, and a black one—the most harmful of all—which provokes delirium,* it is legitimate for us to see the legacy of an ideology recalling, once again, chromatic symbolisms familiar to us from the analysis of tarantism.

Further, when Pliny recounts the tradition, also documented elsewhere, according to which at Latmos in Caria the bite of the scorpion was lethal only to the natives, but left foreigners unharmed,* we cannot help but think of the taranta who, according to tradition, is harmful only in Apulia and especially to Apulians, or who suspends her poison in the “fiefdom of Galatina,” or in a certain cell of the Capuchin monastery of Brindisi, according to local determinations that can acquire a sense only if placed within the framework of the bite’s symbolic autonomy, with its relative cultural conditioning.

Finally, when the same Pliny, again with regard to the scorpion, mentions the lethal character that it always has for girls and almost always for women,* the comparison comes spontaneously to mind with the predominantly female participation in the crisis—cure of tarantism, and with the particular incidence of the crisis among girls in the period of puberty. Such facts and relations do not find an explanation on the level of a real toxic syndrome of arachnidism, but on a symbolic one of the bite as the horizon for certain conflicts which recur in female life, and especially in the age of puberty, within the framework of a given existential regime.

Independently of these data, drawn from a mature literary tradition in which naturalistic observation and mythical heritage appear strictly intertwined, the symbolic autonomy of the bite or sting in Greece takes on a characteristic form which connects it not so much to the representation of a poison injected into the veins as, instead, that of a menacing sting which compels an anguished, delirious, hallucinating, and furious flight. In a fragment by Aeschylus, the goad of Lyssa, the giver of manias, is called “the scorpion’s dart,”* an image to which the theme of the poisoned bite is perhaps not extraneous. In Aeschylus’ depiction, oistros is the sting of the gadfly which irresistibly drives the victim to run about aimlessly, his heart full of Phobos and Lyssa, of fear and fury. The particular emotional relief which the vain flight acquires for saving oneself from “stinging” solicitation makes the oistros similar to the goad which cowherds use to prod cattle, and establishes a semantic equivalence among oistros, myops {horsefly] and kentron [goad, prick]. Such an equivalence, commonly used, appears in the myth of Lyssa and the Erinys* armed with a goad and provoking mania in men.” In the character of To, just as she has been shaped by Aeschylus — in Prometheus, the images of oistros are composed in a vivid unity and take part in a concretely perceptible drama.

The “wandering virgin,” priestess of the temple of Hera at Argo, is the victim of a precluded love, of a marriage which is impossible for humans: her misfortune begins one night, in her virginal chamber, when flattering phantasms continuously exhort her to end her state of virginity and give herself up to a glorious marriage with Zeus, who desired the maiden ardently. Io reveals her tormenting visions to her father Inachus, who receives from an oracle the response that he should turn his daughter out of the house and leave her to wander freely to the ends of the earth.

Here, a subtle battle of cunning begins between Zeus and the jealous Hera: Zeus transforms the maiden into a cow in order to possess her as a bull, and Hera has her guarded by the hundred-eyed herdsman Argus; Argus is killed by Hermes, sent by Zeus, and Hera in turn sends a gadfly to the maiden, which with its sting irresistibly * The Furies.

But may the love of the greater gods never cast on me a single glance. That is a fight which cannot be fought, the straight road to cepa become of me, I cannot say; for I see no way to escape the design of Zeus.

HISTORICAL COMMENTARY THE SYMBOLISM OF O/STROS 191

literature. Although the famous episode of Prometheus does not involve the theme of poisoning, but rather, the pursuing goad, some structural similarities with tarantism beg our attention. Io is the victim of a precluded love, of the irresistible amorous ardor of Zeus and the implacable jealousy of Hera, the guardian of legitimate marriages: but the theme of precluded love, an irresistible yet impossible eros, is of great importance among the existential motivations for the crisis of tarantism, especially among the girls who are preparing to set aside the legacy of their childhoods and open themselves up to their destiny as women.

Io is a cow, and her animal-type possession is depicted according to the image of the gadfly which torments cattle and pursues them with its sting: in tarantism, the animal that possesses and the one that torments are not mythically articulated, but in fact the tarantate can be just as well depicted as "bitten by the taranta" and "pursued by the bite of the taranta." Io bears a name which echoes in a cry (i0, id, it, iti), she is a maiden-cry: but the tarantate, too, have their cry, the ah-eee of the crisis, which is one of the characteristics defining them as tarantate.

Finally, if Io is driven to run by the hypnotizing melody of Argus, halting her run in an arboreal and aquatic setting, an analogous event was ritually mimicked in the earliest forms of tarantism, as we see from numerous accounts and especially that — cited above — of the doctor Nicola Caputo of Lecce: "It often happens that those who go dancing through the towns and hamlets accompanied by the usual melodies arrive in some orchard, where in the shade of a tree, near a pond or stream offered by nature or prepared by artifice, they abandon themselves to the dance" — that is, they resolve their crises through the dance and the other details of the ritual. And this attraction "ad. aquas, ad fontes, ad ramum viridem" [to water, to springs, to a green branch] (to repeat Corrado's words) was so intense that even in the domestic version of the ceremony, arboreal and aquatic decorations were used, bridling the flight and errores [wandering] into the rhythmic dash around the cramped ceremonial perimeter, and bending the agitation into the figures of the dance.

These resemblances cannot be merely casual, and in fact they are not, given that they depend on the common religious reality in which both of the terms" of the comparison have their roots. There is no doubt that the wandering virgin ~ the victim of Zeus and Hera who bursts onto the scene when Promethe______ But poets always ground the blossoms of their images in the existential humus of their own historical world, and the poets who live it in religious civilizations always communicate with this humus through religious symbols that give a horizon to the existential crises of their society. Here Aeschylus’ image of Io harbors more vivid and perceptible traces of precisely these underlying religious symbols — along with their connection to given critical moments in an existence and to specific modes of the crisis — than those which may fragmentarily and occasionally crop up in writings of mythographers and scholars. This is a crisis which involves the world of women, especially priok, to marriage, unleashed by an eros which is frustrated for various reasons ® crisis manifested in various elements: in the flight to solitude in arboreal and aquatic settings; under the stimulus of a stinging, hallucinating and ciphered provocation, as irresistible as the anger of an outraged spirit can be; an animal-ssession accompanied by a violent retreat from social life and the refusal of the civil order of the human world; a suicidal impulse which risks putting an end to the miserable flight; the hypnotic melody which accompanies the running about; the revelation of a destination and an end to a wandering which initially appeared aimless and endless; the resolution of the crisis in an arboreal paradise flowing with perennial healing waters, where the reintegration of the unsettled female destiny is carried out and human form and reason are regained symbolically and with the aid of the divine forces which were themselves part of the drama’s origin. All of these elements form a plot which is apparent in the poetic image of Io, and which we must now examine in its meaning as a religious symbol.

A fragment of a short pseudo-Hippocratic treatise on women’s illnesses describes some forms of crisis in the Greek world which frequently afflicted maidens and women whose equilibrium had been altered by remaining childless. Such crises, explicitly compared by the author to the “sacred disease,” were characterized by a form of stupor, followed by fever and tremors, then mania, anguish, outbursts of fury, impulses to suicide by drowning or hanging.

The following case described by Plutarch attests the frequency of psychic disorders of this sort, especially among adolescents, and the collective character they took on. Once, with no apparent cause, the virgins of Miletus fell prey to an irresistible desire to die, and many of them ran off to hang themselves, indifferent to the tears and persuasion of their family and friends, who took useless precautions to protect them from such an incomprehensible and atrocious impulse. The city was profoundly devastated by this calamity, which was beyond any human remedy and seemed “sent by some spirit,” until a wise legislator prescribed that the corpses of the maidens who had hung themselves be exposed in the marketplace naked and with the ropes around their necks. The law created the desired effect, and after its promulgation the suicidal epidemic of the virgins of Miletus immediately ended.

Aristoxenus of Taranto tells how a crisis of this sort once beset a city of the Magna Grecia, taking on the usual epidemic character: women seated at a banquet suddenly entered into an ecstatic state, in which they thought they heard voices calling them; running to follow this call, they abandoned their homes and fled the city. In the face of this rampant calamity, the inhabitants of Locri and Reggio consulted the oracle, whose answer was that, to drive off this illness, paeans would have to be sung in the Spring for fourteen days straight: this gave rise in Italy, that is, in Magna Grecia, to a flourishing activity of numerous paean writers. The value of these documents lies in the fact that they do not narrate origin myths nor describe ceremonies, but aim to give accounts of real historical episodes, interpreted as psychic disorders and illnesses. In the Pseudo-Hippocratic treatise, episodes recurring generically in the Greek female world, especially in the pubescent age, are evaluated in a medical perspective. Plutarch tells of a disease which once struck the virgins of Miletus and which induced the legislator to a drastic and efficacious intervention. Aristoxenus keeps within the bounds of a definite historical event to which he was a direct witness: "In his biography of Telestos, the musician Aristoxenus, having met each other in Italy, there was an outbreak of various illnesses, among them a peculiar disease which struck women."

The author of the pseudo-Hippocratic treatise hints with oneal irony at the sacrifices to Artemis practiced in these cases at the avall. It is true that Plutarch tells us that the people of Miletus believed in the divine character of their women's mania; and it is just as true that Aristoxenus notifies us of the institution of a spring ceremony in order to deal with a disorder of the same type which arose in the region of Magna Grecia, perhaps even in Taranto itself.

But all this only offers an opportunity for cathartic practices according to a common ideotype. Accounts of the pseudo-Hippocrates, Plutarch, and Aristoxenus can be considered precious indications of what we may call, in modern language, frequent crises of maladjustment in the Greek world that risked women collectively in relation to their biological and cultural destinies as daughters, mothers, and widows.

Moreover, from such accounts, we may deduce that the most striking traits of the crisis were stupor, pain, delirium, fury, and the flight and suicidal impulses by hanging or drowning.

The diffusion and intensity of these crises in the female world were matched by women's widespread participation in the horizon of mythic-ritual connectiail, which goes under the name of maenadism. The maenads, the bacchantes, Thyiads, bassarids, the Spartan dysmainai, and Macedonian clodones, with their variety of designations and geographic dissemination, all testify to the important part played by the female element in the most strictly or jestig aspects of the Dionysian cult.

Some scholars of the second half of the last century, especially Rapp and Voigt, tended to limit the female participation in ritual incidence of the maenad's image, which appears in tragedy and in the arts, not so much because of what emerges from the documentation, but because it seemed to them "psychologically" and "historically" impossible to reconcile the austerity of Greek women, and that of the proverbial Spartan woman, with a widespread diffusion of ritual maenadism so clearly out of keeping with any sort of regime of feminine austerity.

But this was a scholarly fancy: it is a "psychological" notion that is almost too basic, and it is not even necessary to turn to psychoanalysis to arrive at it, that precisely the harsh social pressure exercised on the female world in an androcratic type of society leads to the return of the repressed in the form of ciphered neurotic symptoms incompatible with any cultural order whatsoever, and which therefore require an adequate treatment for their prevention and resolution. The Symbolism of Oistros

In the context of Sparta, known for the austerity of its women, it is interesting to recall the proverbial association of Sparta with the practices of maenadism and the analysis of iconographic material, which leads to the conclusion that there was a widespread female participation in orgiastic cults.

Maenadism is characterized by a violent break from the civil community, with a flight toward arboreal and aquatic solitude, and a descent into a state of hallucinated furor. However, it also involves an orientation toward the control of disorder and resolution of the crisis, where a place of worship would be established in the harsh solitude of mountains and forests, near a sacred tree, spring, or stream, or in places that in some way reproduced a natural forest or aquatic setting.

In maenadism and other female orgiastic cults, the "flight" aspect of the crisis, compatible with any other civil order, appears reshaped and oriented within a mythical-ritual horizon. The flight as a closed, ciphered, incoherent symptom is not "repeated" in its critical immediacy in maenadism, but is taken back up and opened to a meaning, released and regulated until its resolution.

The symbol of the flight from the civil community seems to follow the flight of the crisis, but in reality, it accepts the flight's cue in order to alter its course, to graft on its own cultural discipline, and turn the flight into seclusion, passage, transformation, acceptance of destiny, and reentry into the community.

As examples, the figure of Io, as Aeschylus has shaped her, corresponds to the Argive "myth of Proétus' daughters," who during puberty were guilty of a rebellion against Hera. The Proetides were struck with mania, which was manifested by a flight from their paternal home and with aimless wanderings, recalling the oistros pursuing Io.

The Proetides, like Io, appear in the act of "being cows" (Proetides implerunt - falsis mugitibus agros) (The Proetides fill the fields with false moos]. Io, chased by the hundred-eyed cowherd and stopping her flight in an arboreal and aquatic landscape where her destiny as a mother would be fulfilled in symbolic form, has its counterpart in the Argive myth in the therapy of the mantis Melampus, who, with the aid of strong youths, organizes a chase of the maidens through ritual cries and possession dances, leading the possessed girls from the mountains to the sea, to Sicyonia.

This also recalls the tradition regarding the mantis Bachis, who freed the women of Sparta from their mania, having been struck by a Bacchic oistros. In Bacchylides' version of the myth of the Proetides, not Melampus but the father Proétus himself searches for the girls and follows them through the mountains, until he reaches them near a stream called Lysos or Lysios, in which he carries out a purification ritual. He then asks Artemis to free his daughters from their miserable attack of mania and promises the goddess a sacrifice of twenty red heifers, not yet

This practice in tarantism has its classical antecedent in the symbolism of the aidresis, the swing as a ritual. In his description of the Nekyia painted Polygnotus in the lesche of the Cnidians at Delphi, Pausanias recalls Phaedra was depicted in the act of swinging, and he adds the following comment: “The pose suggests the way Phaedra died, though in a less harsh form.” This symbolic meaning of the swing has been rejected by Picard," ause it appears that there can be no acceptable connection between the nbol and the thing symbolized, between the swing and hanging, between an arian ritual — usually interpreted as a practice of cathartic and fertilizing ic— and a means of taking one’s life. In effect, were it only for the comment by Pausanias, the connection would remain obscure and could even be dismissed as arbitrary. Yet there are some existential relations and certain mythical-ritual indications which render it comprehensible upon closer examination. We have already observed how in the recurrent crises of the Greek female world, flight from civil community often involved the risk of suicide, and that the suicidal impulse was often acted upon by drowning or hanging. In relation to these existential risks, which were especially threatening in the age of puberty, but more generally concerned the sphere of an eros frustrated for various reasons, certain mythical-ritual horizons were called to face the crises. If the aimless flight was reined in and controlled in the way we have seen, and suicide by drowning became a cathartic emersion which transfigured the insane gesture of throwing oneself into water, suicide by hanging found its own refashioning in the symbol of the swing. In this regard, we can consider the festival of the Aiéra as the most pertinent and best-documented example.

The myth narrates how, following the murder of Icarius by drunken vine-dressers, his daughter Erigone set about searching for her father, and she hanged herself on a tree after having found his corpse. After the death of Erigone, a suicidal mania overcame the Attic virgins. Crazed, they ran to hang themselves, until the oracle of Apollo predicted that the divinity's anger would be placated after the establishment of the festival of the Aiéra.

The Aiéra were celebrated during the Anthesteria (on the second day, according to Nilsson, and on the third, according to Deubner): they grafted onto the spring festival of the sprouts, with its markedly agrarian tone in the typical climate of a new year's festival in which the losses of the outgoing year were settled, debts contracted with the world of the dead were paid, fertility and fortune of the coming year were prefigured and assured, and a new period was entered into "with a clean slate," in a "new start" which tended to erase the unfavorable past and purge the uncertain future of negativity.

With regard to the interpretation, the Anthesteria obviously condensed multiple symbolic meanings; among these, the agrarian meaning appears dominant. However, until now, no one has emphasized the meaning of the "crisis of female puberty" which underlies the mythical-ritual horizon of the Aiéra. Such a horizon becomes comprehensible, and not arbitrary, when one considers the risk that adolescent girls would not detach themselves from the father, substituting his image with that of a possible spouse, a risk which becomes a corresponding critical moment. The ensuing conflict is manifested in the unconscious as a gesture that from the outside superimposes itself upon internal movements and regulates them, as occurs in the Bacchic rites and as mothers do when they nurse their infants. So let's take this as our basic principle in both cases: all young children, and especially very infants, benefit both physically and mentally from being nursed and kept in motion, as far as practicable, throughout the day and night; indeed, if only it could be managed, they ought to live as though they were permanently on board ship. But as that's impossible, we must aim to provide our new-born infants with the closest possible approximation to this ideal. Here's some further evidence, from which the same conclusions should be drawn: the fact that young children’s nurses, and the women who cure Corybantic conditions, ‘ have learnt this treatment from experience and have come to recognize its value. And suppose you know what a mother does when she wants to get a wakeful child to sleep. Far from keeping him still, she takes care to move him about, rocking him constantly in her arms, not silently, but humming a kind of tune. The cure consists of movement, to the rhythms of dance and song; the mother makes her child pipe down just as surely as _ the music of the pipes bewitches the frenzied Bacchic reveler."

In Timeus, with regard to rhythmic exercise as a medicine for the body and soul, Plato takes back up the theory that external movements regulate internal ones, and he again mentions the aidresis, referring once more to the image of rhythmic oscillation one feels on a ship and attributing a cathartic and therapeutic power to incessant rhythmic motion that imitates Nature, nurse and mother of all things," who cosmically cradles bodies.** Plato’s reflections are rooted in an experience of the aidéresis which we have almost entirely lost, but which we may regain in historical thought, considering how such reflections are connected with the part of Greek religious life that found its expression in the divine mania, and in particular in the festival of the aiéra as a mythical-ritual horizon for the crises of pubescent girls.

The swing of the virgins (or of dolls hung on trees) had, as we have said, a meaning of symbolic release of the impulse to suicide by hanging: but at the same time other meanings operated in the symbol, contributing to the catharsis. The aidresis, swinging in space, has its primordial figure in being rocked in maternal arms: it is thus an extreme "memory" and functions as an extreme horizon for recovery and for settling _ the infantile situations to which one has remained tied. In this sense, as an _ imitation of being rocked, the swing constitutes a lived project of returning to _ the past.

A third meaning concerns the internal structure of being rocked and the _ thythmic oscillation of the swing. The rocked infant crosses an identical space gain and again in an isochronic tempo, tracing a path and then immediately Canceling it, without the least intervention of the infant entering into play in this event, since the operator is the mother. Precisely because of this always- - identical space, first conceded and then immediately taken away according to constant rhythm, the immediate experience of living fades, and tranquility and sleepiness follow.

If the other figure of the aidresis— the swing — on the one hand recalls infantile rocking, on the other hand, it marks detachment from own destiny as a woman, and in the sphere of consciousness as a ciphereé drive to aimless flight and suicide. The myth of Erigone evoked this drama of pubescent maidens, projecting it in mythical-ritual figures to mimic: through an exemplary event, the participants revived the search for the father who perished in a violent death, giving expression to and illuminating that wanderi which, in the horizonless crisis, risked remaining blind and impulsive. The swing of the virgins — or the oscillation of dolls hung onto tree branches — carried o} the suicidal impulse in an alienated and attenuated form, while the a/letis song furnished the illuminating hieros logos. The myth also tells of the punishment of the guilty parties and the transformation of Erigone and Icarius into stars. With this outcome, the looming separation from the father and the sense of guilt which accompanied it was overcome and sublimated, and they became a situation to be contemplated forever in the sky.

The center of the resolution was constituted by the symbolism of the swing, which not by chance gave its name to the entife festival. The degree to which the cathartic experience of the aidresis was alive” in the Greek world is attested to by some curious reflections in Plato, which we can grasp only when they are placed in relation to the religious world of ritually (and mythically) oriented mania.

In Book VII of the Laws, Plato refers to the rhythmic swinging to illustrate the way in which order can be reestablished in the terrors, pains, and unrest of early childhood and adolescence.

There is a fourth meaning of the swing as a prefiguration of coitus, a symbolic projection of what will be the earthly destiny of the maiden. This interpretation is coherent with the scene of the swing on the opposite side of the skyphos, mentioned by Deubner as part of another moment of the Anthesteria, the sacred marriage between the basilean archon’s bride and Dionysus.

This apparatus, with its multiple meanings, allowed the primitive impulse to suicide by hanging to be attenuated and transformed. The figure of the myth became a means of approaching the death of childhood and adolescence, opening up the destinies threatened to be precluded by the crisis.

The swing symbol prefigured coitus with a possible spouse, and the apparatus was part of the wider framework of the "festival of sprouts" — the Anthesteria — at the end of the Attic spring. Participation in this framework offered further emotional relief and allowed the resolution of recurrent impulses. 

The role of a girl's death in her existence as a maiden. Or, again in the symbolism of hanging, we could refer to the cult of Facy tis in Kariai: during annual celebrations which took place near a Be carvers Karyatis means "Artemis of the walnut tree"), the girls performed dances that were suddenly interrupted when they hung themselves from the branches of the walnut tree? As it has been suggested to us, this event may be interpreted as a historical memory crisis or as a mythical horizon of ritual oscillation of the Aidra type, but for our purposes, it would not be appropriate to extend our research on the basis of this information to yield appreciable results. Instead, it would be more useful to focus on the way Euripedes represents Phaedra's figure.

In the text, Phaedra is the victim of a tragic love for her stepson, and her nurse asks what is wrong with her. At a certain point, Phaedra sits up on her pallet and bursts into the following words: "Aiai! / If only I could draw a draught / of pure water from a dewy spring, / and rest myself, /lying beneath the black poplars / and in the lush meadow!"

A system for protecting them from crises of maladjustment endangering their lives as they approached womanhood. Besides its undeniable agrarian meaning, the mythical-ritual symbol of Erigone delineates a horizon for resolving these crises: in a highly emotional atmosphere and in a period of the agricultural year that was extremely important for the life of the whole community, the girls fused their individual conflicts, treating them on a common level of symbolic operations and unifying them in an event which gave a name, a face, and gestures to the unexpressed.

At this point, we could widen the study to other "hanged girls" in mythology and discuss, for example, the mythical-ritual symbol of Charila, the offended orphan who hangs herself. In the ritual of Delphi, which took place every year, Phaedra's nurse seeks to placate the troubled woman, but Phaedra jumps from her pallet, driven by an impulse of oreibasia, the sudden aspiration of limbs.

The poet's free shaping allows us to explore the text's nexus to much greater advantage than the exegesis of mythographers, scholiasts, and scholars. Euripides creates a tale of inertia, which is impossible and precluded, with a love that is unattainable. Phaedra's sudden aspiration to head for the mountain and an aquatic and arboreal landscape symbolizes the impulse to take on the masculine activity of hunting.

According to De Martino, through "dehistorification" the individual crisis is absorbed in the metahistorical narrative offered by the myth-ritual nexus, which is the means by which religious reintegration helps to overcome the crisis. While De Martino's thinking on this presents affinities with Lévi-Strauss's analysis of the Cuna myth of Muu for treating difficult cases like childbirth, De Martino goes much further than Lévi-Strauss in relating these techniques to Psychoanalysis, and dehistorification becomes a central element in his theorization.

To return now to tarantism and its connection to the oscillations of a spider hanging on a thread and the swing, we must at least wonder whether or not the existential basis of the relationship, apparently so arbitrary, should be sought in the need to give a horizon to the critical moments of spinners and weavers at work.

The Metamorphoses. New York: The Viking Press). THE SYMBOLISM OF A/ORESIS 203 202 HISTORICAL COMMENTARY recovery from the crisis and the “change in its course.” Even the symbolism op the mirror, operating in the earliest forms of tarantism, hints at the same sphe if only partially. The first scene of the liturgy in the Villa of the Mysteries depj a young woman, seated, who is dressing her hair, while an erote holds a Mirro up for her: it is an initial act of mystical wedding ~ the toilette of the bride _ followed by other moments of initiation and finally orgiastic dance,® Now, the moment of the nuptial dress and the mirror as an instrument of mysti coquetry recurs in tarantism, and even today the tarantate dress up as “brides: of St. Paul,” representing a Christian transposition of nuptial scenes which in early forms of tarantism must have been important aside from any connection whatsoever______ Moreover, among the various symbolic meanings of the mirror as a ritual instrument of tarantism, there is a polarizing of attention to oneself, inducing a “narcissistic regression”: which—Just as with the forest or the spring—functions as an extreme horizon, through which the evocation of the unfavorable past can be carried out, a “return to the past” which is necessary for the release and elimination of conflicts operating in the unconscious. The symbolic ambiguity of the mirror derives from its association with the child Dionysus and the death of Narcissus, and also with a recognition and reintegration of one’s own soul.

Yet there is an element in tarantism, that of ritual agonistics, which is not oriented toward the female orgiastic cults, but toward male initiations. As was noted previously, in early tarantism we see the sword dance together with various scenes of agonistics and exhibitions of skill. Kircher speaks of performances of this type, and in the report sent by Sangenito to Bulifon, there is a note of an actual show, probably in connection to some episode of the Crusades.

Now, the relationship between archaic male initiations and agonistics is a well-known fact, and to keep within the sphere of Greek contexts, it is sufficient to recall the dance of the Curetes, the pyrrhic dance, the gymnopedie, the combat of Platanistius, and everything else in the educational system of Sparta and Athens connected to archaic initiatory agonistics. From our perspective, the gymnopedie are of particular interest, as they took place in the full fierceness of the summer heat and involved, among other things, danced performances of battles and minor episodes of arms, more or less legendary. In one of these performances, reference was made to an episode of war between the Spartans and Argives in the sixth century, and it was articulated into a complex mimicry and various swordsmanship figures.

Other indications in the same direction emerge from the passage by Epifanio Ferdinando, where among the dances of the tarantati two are cited called “chain” and "red cloth." The ormos (chain) was a specifically Spartan dance carried out by youths and maidens in chains, and on an Apulian vase, the dance appears led by a youth who parades in a male step, while the girls display bashfulness and modesty in their bearing. Moreover, the "red cloth" might recall the red dress with which the dance was performed and the Spartans' red war uniform, though it could be simpler to consider it the expression of an archaic chromatic symbolism connected with ritual agonistics.

The expression "narcissistic regression" is a selective appropriation of Freud by De Martino. De Martino includes Freud's essay "Magic and Narcissistic Regression" in his anthology Magia e civilta (1962), but in his commentary, he rejects Freud's eurocentrism in extending this notion from Western neurotics to non-European civilizations. In the context of the present discussion, however, he does not hesitate to employ the expression to explain the functioning of tarantism's ritual and symbolism.

Appellative for Apollo, god of the plane-tree grove.

The analysis of Apulian tarantism's classical antecedents leads us in yet another direction, towards the sphere of musical catharsis for psychic and moral disorders connected to states of deities, demons, spirits of the dead, and heroes. It must be —the musical cure for the bite of the in Greece, at least on the basis of the traces we find in the Euthydemus, where Plato tells of the use of epodai, sung formulas here and there. "Additionally, the famous legend of Orpheus and Eurydi, which originally narrated the success of Orpheus’ attempt to use music to steal the young Eurydice, bitten by a snake, away from Hades, might be taken in support of the use of musical enchantment to treat and bring back to life maidens 'bitten' by poisonous animals. But data of this sort are too generic and not helpful to the chosen perspective. It would not be helpful to conduct an in-depth investigation – one which has, moreover, already been conducted in specific monographs – of the cases in which music was employed with therapeutic intentions in Greek religious life.

On this point, it is sufficient for our purposes to consider this essential aspect: that the Greek experience of pathos effected a continuous transition from the somatic sphere to the psychic one and to the moral and religious one, and in relation to this, the therapeutic use of music (and of dance) always implied a catharsis, embracing within a common horizon of symbolic efficacies illnesses that we would qualify from case to case as illnesses of the body, disorders of the psyche or moral conflicts.

Within the framework of a study of the classical antecedents of tarantism, it seems more productive for us to instead examine references to a form of musical catharsis which enjoyed particular prestige in the Greek world. From a passage in Plato’s Euthydemus, we draw an interesting hint regarding the form of musical catharsis which took place during the practices of Corybantiasm. There are words of encouragement that Crito addresses to the adolescent Cleinias, who risks being ensnared by the sophisms of the two strangers:

Euthydemus was hastening to throw the young man for the third fall when I, seeing that he was going down and wanting to give him a chance to breathe so that he should not turn coward and disgrace us, encouraged him, saying, 'Don't be surprised, Cleinias, if these arguments seem strange to you, since perhaps you don't take in what the visitors are doing with you. They are doing exactly what people do in the Corybantic mysteries when they intend to initiate someone. If you have been initiated, you know that the one who is dancing and sporting on these occasions is doing nothing except for cases of somatic possession on the part of the possessor. Phalangi has only a few rare correspondences, for example, against the bites of snakes, phalangi and scorpions.'

Another precious indication of the Corybantic ceremonies comes from the passage in Jon, where Plato compares poetic inspiration to Corybantic frenzy. Bion establishes a relationship between the preference for a single poet and the preferences of the possessed for a single musical air, that is, the one associated with the quality of the divinity possessing them:

And you are one of these [those preferentially inspired only by a single poet, such as Musaeus or Homer], and are possessed by Homer. Whenever any other poet's work is mentioned, you fall asleep and haven't a thing to say; but when someone gives tongue to a strain of this one, you are awake at once, your spirit dances, and you have much to say; for not by art or science do you say of Homer what you say, but by dispensation from above and by divine possession." 

So the worshiping Corybantes o : lively feeling for that strain alone which is of the deity by whom they are ~~ ne for that melody are well supplied with attitudes and utterances, and heed no o é The indications given by the passages in the Euthydemus and in Jon a refer is two different aspects of the Corybantic ceremonies: enthronement, that - the dance carried out around the initiate with the use of Vena S cymbals, drums) and wind instruments (flutes), and the initiate Ss Riso . ‘musical preference for a single melody, the one associated with t goa : “possessing him. Now, these two different aspects, which in the two Plato “passages are unrelated to each other, might be interpreted as two syle oments of a same ceremony which Plato had present from which to draw his comparisons: a ceremony in which at the moment of the Re rae a ‘musical (or choreutic-musical) exploration took place with the use . ae melodies, until the moment when, at the sound of the right melody, . initiate was shaken from his deathly inertia and opened himself up to t e rhythm of the dance and sung word. Moreover, the passages from oe Hippolytus cited above suggest the widespread use of ; the seapteaneee - : exploring moment in cases of persons struck with mania, where the c! ‘sie the women of Trezene asks which deity it is and the nurse formulates the plan of turning to a mantis to solve the question.

Finally, ‘with regard to the more specific affinities between tarantism and Corybantiasm, it should be remembered that Corybantiasm featured armed dances, self- s,flicted wounds, oracular displays and perhaps even the use of the mirror as an instrument for provoking the trance: all elements which, as we have said, are found in the earliest forms of Apulian tarantism.”° _ But Greek musical catharsis sheds light on the structure of tarantism from another point of view, too, if we consider the cultural consciousness which the Greek world had of the______ But in a more immediate form, it also circulated in tragedy, where the distinction between psychic disorder and 'ritually-oriented mania was not lacking. For example, the madness of Heracles or Orestes was different from Dionysian excitement: the furor of Lyssa was "a dance without drums, lacking the amiable thyrsus of Bromios,"* and the Erinni performed a round-dance that was "not inspired by Bacchus."

For our purposes here, we will examine only one aspect of this cultural consciousness: the ideas in this regard which appear in Platonic thought. We have already seen how the passage of Laws relative to the aidresis was closely connected to the Platonic theory of cathartic power of rhythmic movement and music: the lullabies with which mothers and nurses rock infants and the choreutic-musical order with which mania gets controlled in the orgiastic cults are like two different expressions of the ordering efficacy of external movement on internal movement. As Plato himself writes:

Socrates: "...Crito, my dear friend, be assured that these are the words I seem to hear the music of their flutes, and the echo of these all, if you speak in opposition to them, you can accomplish anything, speak."

Crito: "I have nothing to say, Socrates."

Socrates: "Let it be then, Crito, and let us proceed in this way, since this is the way the god [Laws] presents his arguments during his Prosopopoeia, as bearing the same preferential and exclusive force of the melody which can bring those who act like Corybantes" out of their inertia: this must discourage Crito from opposing other arguments, because it would be as if having found the right melody for those possessed by the Corybantes, pleasing to their spirit, one tried to present still other melodies.

In this sense, the entire difficult musical exploration: but now, after the Prosopopoeia of Laws, the only melody left is the one which, in the specific case, the deity incontrovertibly indicates as correct. Opposition to the necessity of this melody would only be in vain, and therefore the investigation has been completed; the dialogue ends, just as it ends with the discovery of the right melody in the exploratory phase of the Corybantic exorcism.

Now, if this interpretation is exact — and it does not appear that the steps must be stretched to render it plausible; on the contrary, with this interpretation the comparison contained in each step is more pertinent to the context — we are faced with one of the fundamental structures of tarantism, according to what we have seen from the fieldwork and from the examination of the historical literature on the subject. This structure involves, as we have seen, a musical exploration carried out on the poisoned victim (who is possessed) and his ritually oriented reawakening when the melody pleasing to the poisoning taranta is identified from a traditionalized repertory.

In the Practices of the Sardinian argia, too, the exploratory phase of dance and music around the poisoned-possessed victim takes on particular importance, with the intent of establishing whether the argia is a maiden, wife or widow. These correspondences confirm the hypothesis of an archaic proto-Mediterranean complex, whose structures are maintained not only in Corybantiasm, in Apulian tarantism and related Sardinian and Iberian forms, but also in African cults like zar and bori, and in their Afro-American extensions and developments.

Both these conditions [in Corybantic possession and in children] are a species of fear, and fear is the result of some inadequacy in the personality. When one treats such conditions by vigorous movement, this external motion, by canceling out the internal agitation that gives rise to the fear [phobos] and frenzy [mania], induces, after all the painful thumping of the heart experienced by each patient, a feeling of calm and peace in his soul. The result is very gratifying. Whereas the wakeful children are sent to sleep, the revelers (far from asleep!) by being set to dance to the music of the pipes, are restored to mental health after their derangement, with the assistance of the gods to whom they sacrifice SO propitiously.*

The initial disorder is thus indicated as delirious anxiety — deima, phobos, mania — which arises from some fragility or ineptitude of the spirit; infants and followers of orgiastic cults suffered from this disorderly movement. The ordering power to treat this movement was, for infants, the rhythmic movement of the aidresis accompanied by a lullaby, and for participants in the te/etai and the katharmoi, the rhythmic movement of music and dance.

In Phaedrus, Plato distinguishes two types of mania, one due to human illness and one inspired by deities, and he divides divine mania into two subtypes, the second of which is related to the orgiastic cults and is placed under the inspiration of Dionysus. When we see Plato's reference to the re/estic that form of mania, it is joined to the teletai and the katharmoi, "in assistance" through the feletai and the Katharmoi. Since the expression of music and dance is divine, it carries the risk of illness or an ongoing illness. At the same time, Plato brings up any aid and since he doesn't mention any force for resolution, which is unfolded in the orientation of star-like ancestral houses, it is lean inalS EVDO anes segandnng ss gaa et the mythical-ritual symbol in action.

By virtue of such episodes, Plato generically refers to conflicts and disorders along the lines of delirium, changes its course: no longer an incoherent ached or resolution, those which devastated the descendants of Cadmus or Atreus, and which it becomes a symbol which opens itself d a ADEE dosed sympto pushed the daughters of Proétus or Minyas to mania.* In Phaedo, moreover, ramatically to value.

" model of this event - mothers and nurses rocking their restless infants to ; it , lullaby, just as mother nature herself, cosmic rocker of bodies, does on a wide scale. Telestic Madness, Ritually-Oriented Madness, and the "Right Sort of Madness"

Telestic madness, which contains the principle of its own resolution, is thus orthé mania, madness which changes its course. Plato not only does not confuse madness with religious mania, and psychic disorders with the mythical-ritual order of the orgiastic cults, but he also senses that the mythical-ritual order is grafted onto 'the crisis, imitating it in order to release it, to alter its course and orient it towards its resolution.

Plato places a state of fragility and ineptitude 'of the soul at the root of the phobos, and at the same time he conceives telestic 'madness as a resolution-bringing orientation of the phobos through mythical- ritual symbols in which the rhythmic order of music and dance has a decisive role.

Aristotelian theory of katharsis as regulated 'release of suffering basically proceeds along the same lines, with its roots, just as with the Platonic reflections, in the experiences connected with orgiastic 'ceremonial of the mysteries.

Madness can provide relief from the greatest plagues of trouble that beset cert, families because of their guilt for ancient crimes: it turns up among those who need an out; it gives prophecies and takes refuge in prayers to the gods and in worship, disco a mystic rites [teletai] and purifications [katharmoi] that bring the man it touches through to safety for this and all time to come.

So it is that the right sort of madness finds relief from present hardships for a man it has possessed.

Telestic madness, ritually-oriented madness, and the "right sort of madness" thus imply movement toward reason through the mediation of ceremoniil regulated excitation, in the framework of a particular mythical horizon of deity which gives the crisis and at the same time reintegrates it into reas Deima, phobos and mania can be "straightened out" when the fragility and ineptitude of the soul are addressed.

It should also be remembered that this musical catharsis, both as a religious practice and as a theoretical elaboration, had its elective homeland in Magna Grecia, exercising important influences on the thought of Plato and Aristotle themselves. The Pythagorians were not only theoreticians of the healing efficacy of music, but also practitioners of catharsis. Pythagoras employed healing music, which was likewise utilized by Archytas, Aristoxenus, and Cleinias.

Those who suffered from sciatica and "sacred disease" turned to the musician Aristoxenus for treatment, and once a sufferer came to him on the order of the oracle of Pasifile. Aristoxenus also used music to treat the excitement provoked by wine, and in the sphere which we more properly call moral, he believed that the aulos and the lyre were particularly suitable for moderating manners and safeguarding the good government of the city.

We also associate Aristoxenus' name with the aforementioned episode of mania among the Italic women and the institution of therapeutic paeans. As for another Tarantine, Cleinias, tradition holds that he habitually used the cathartic efficacy of music.

This idea of an opening toward value, repeated elsewhere in the text, is one aspect of De sara theorization of how myth and ritual function in the context of the individual's existential crisis, the crisis of presence. While he credits Jung with the insight that symbols serve as a bridge from the crisis state to reintegration (Furore, Simbolo, Valore: 110), he extends a renewing characteristic humanism and historicism, viewing this bridge as a bridge to his will to be portrayed in human history. This bridge mediates "profane cultural values": ��ée and social life, law and Politics, ethos, art and casisase — that is the human story Sed bisa of mediation, mythical representation and human learning and value...” (Si storia: De Martino’s conception of value operates on an even more ee ae alsa y itself; this is a Heideggerian Dasein, in De Martino’s view, an enerey’ which goes - i ae eng vitality (Storia e metastoria: 100).

Further, a particular importance was attached to the range of disorders which the ancients designated with the name epilepsy, to the point that “Pythagorean life” seemed to a g00d oriented toward a defense from such disorders, and the very passions need katharmoi were described as “small epilepsies.”®

But in Magna Grecia, especially in Taranto, tradition also gives a special prominence to Participation in Dionysian cults. “You, lover of famous Italy” the chorus of Antigone says of Bacchus,” alluding to the fact that the coasts of Southern Italy were among the god’s favorite abodes. As both texts and monuments concur,” Dionysus was the most important god of the Tarantine area: during Dionysia the entire city entered into a state of drunkenness,” and the appearance of the Romans in 282 surprised the citizens, who were engaged in precisely this festive celebration.” In the Bacchic revival of the second century, Taranto was one of the originating centers of the movement, which expanded into the rest of Apulia and beyond;™ and the famous bacchanalia scandal, which began a period of atrocious religious persecutions for the South of the peninsula, largely involved Taranto and Apulia, where both passive and open resistance lasted longest. The scandal broke out not long after the fall of the city, when the South’s social | condition was marked by the extraordinary development of the slave trade after the Roman conquests of the third century,” following the victorious end to the conflict with Carthage, during which Rome nearly faced a final catastrophe at Cannae, in Apulia. The bacchanalia movement, which had extended from Apulia and Brutium to Central Italy, had even gained sway in Rome, probably under the influence of the 30,000 Tarantines whom Fabio had brought there as slaves: the cult was celebrated in the Jucus Stimulae [sacred forest of Stimula] on the slopes of the Aventine hill, which resounded in the night with drums and cymbals and the ululate of bacchantes Tunning by candlelight to a nearby shore of the Tiber. Additionally, when a merciless depression was unleashed by a Senatusconsultum [Senate decree] in A.D. 186, resistance was most tenacious in Apulia and around Taranto. In three years, Rome had to use three praetorians to quash the movement, which was no doubt stoked by political and social motives, as demonstrated by the senate’s energy in repressing it and the resistance with which the repression was met, especially in Apulia: this was confirmed, too, by the blatantly social character of the revolts which took place at the time of Eunus and Spartacus.

And so, after this long detour, we return to the siticulosa Apulia [parched Apulia] of the classical world, which extended monotonously and miserably beyond the forests of the Gargano and their offshoots in Daunia, burnt by the torrid Atabulus, in a landscape where everything was born black, even ‘The hot sirocco wind.

It is our turn to carry on with the journey, in the light of a different image: that of the Land of Remorse. The Falerno wine of Campania was highly regarded in Ancient eae ee * Apella the Jew might credit that, but not I; from Horace’s Satires (Book I, i i i i i without fire. reference to the supposed miracle heard of in Gnatia, of incense melting without fire. In this regard, it was impossible for us to trace any useful indication of the symbolism of the taranta in the Physiologus and medieval sestiaries, or in the prayers, spells and recipes collected by Pradel in Griechische und süditalienische Gebete, Beschwérungen und Rezepte des Mittelalters. The same must also be said for Arab writers. As for the term tarantula, the diminutive tarantula (to which all of the Romance terms are traced, probably indicating different types of spiders) and the later and more popular diminutive jarantella, all we may reasonably affirm from an etymological point of view is the connection of taranta with Taranto, at least until we find some new document which allows us to reconsider the question.

The taranta and her poisonous bite appear for the first time in medieval chronicles in connection with the conflict between the West and Islam, but without reference to Apulia or to the musical exorcism. In Historia Sicula (1604) by Goffredo Malaterra, we read that during the siege of Palermo by Roger and Robert Guiscard, the Norman army encamped near the city was plagued by tarante, and therefore it was necessary to employ the warm oven practice" which, as will be recalled, is used in Sardinia to treat argia poisonings, along with the choreutic-musical exorcism. In Historia Hierosolymitanae expeditionis by Albertus Aquensis — a chronicle of the First Crusade — the crusader army encamped in Syria near the river which is today called Nahr el-Kebir (the Eleutheros of the Greeks), suffered from the bites of tarante which infested the rocky banks.

During the fieldwork conducted in the summer of 1959, we captured the op. a nl going process of disintegration which tarantism experienced due to the of a : of Catholic syncretism: if tarantism was not reducible to the real patois i states which gave impetus to the reintegrating function of its mythical symbol in action, from the end of the 1700s on, the influence of the cult of St. Paul had deeply disturbed the functioning of this symbol with the intrusio. _ culturally heterogeneous element. In particular, in the Chapel of St. Paul a the choreutic-musical exorcism was forbidden, the phenomenon clearly reel to the level of an "illness," with no other appreciable historical-cultural historical-religious meaning. This relationship between tarantism and the cult of St. Paul demonstrates with particular clarity how the vicissitudes of tarantism within Western civilization cannot be isolated from its varied connection wi hegemonic forms of cultural life, and by the modeling or disintegrating influenc arising from this connection, The expansion of Christian civilization, medieve symbolism, the de venenis literature, natural magic, the progress of medi i science in the framework of a new science of nature, Enlightenment thouglil and positivism: all of these not only determined particular attitudes toward tarantism, but also shaped the very phenomenon with respect to which they had taken a position, introducing new determinants, compromising its ancient efficacies. Finally, from a certain point on, they contributed to the rupture of its cultural equilibrium and the start of its decline. In this perspective, what we observed on June 29 and June 30, 1959 in the Chapel of St. Paul becomes indicative of a wider historical connection, which does not allow us to separate out Apulian tarantism from the cultural consciousness that the West had of it in various periods of its history. In fact, such a consciousness does not limit itself to variously "reflecting" a presumed tarantism per se, but influences the evaluated and interpreted object through its evaluation and interpretation, transforming it due to the very fact of evaluating and interpreting it. This means that a "history of tarantism" is possible only as a molecularly determined contribution to the history of the way with which the moral and mental attitudes of Western civilization reached Southern Italy — and in particular Apulia and Apulian tarantism — in various periods, formulating "judgments" which matured into "intervention" in the phenomenon and in continuous modifications of its character. If we leave this dynamic out of our consideration, if we exit from the living circuit that links the high and the low of cultural life, "tarantism pet se" (as we are led to imagine it) no longer exists, leaving in its stead an unthinkable nothingness which only an abstracting and isolating fiction of the intellect could persist in believing to be something.

These observations make us complete the following:

Here they found many heaps of stones; and while the tired and weary multitude laid down and rested among these rocks, some of them were bitten by snakes called tarenta and died from very serious swelling and putrefaction of the body... While, then, in these lands around the city of Sidon many were at risk with these aforementioned snakes, and loud groans and cries rose up from the moribund, they were taught a remedy by the natives to cure all those who had been bitten by snakes and restore them to harsher and nobler exertions: by grasping and squeezing with the right hand the wound provoked by the sting, the poison spreading through the body seemed to cause no further harm. They also learned of another cure: the bite victims had to lie with women, and women with men, in this way freeing both of them from the poison. Finally, the local inhabitants taught the Christian people to beat the stones against each other repeatedly or strike their helmets many times in order to make noise; in this way, the snakes would be frightened by this noise, and the people would be able to sleep peacefully.°*

The oldest document regarding the musical exorcism of the victims of the Poisoned taranta bite is the Sertum papale de venenis mentioned above, and we cite here the part which interests us:

214 HISTORICAL COMMENTARY
For what reason do those bitten by the tarantula find miraculous recovery in various songs and melodies? It must be said that, music and song being a reason for cheerfulness, both are thought to be useful for almost every poison: and since the bite of the tarantula produces a melancholic disease, and because the melancholy with cheerfulness, it follows that songs and music are quite healthy for those who have suffered such a bite...

It is true that the common people and the uneducated claim that the tarantula emits a music at the moment in which it bites; however, in my opinion, this is not so. In fact, each individual has a generic disposition, gaining sensible individuality. Therefore, with regard to taste, some enjoy meat and not every other meat, but only roast lamb, while another hates it, or even despises any type of roast meat. With regard to vision, there is the same variety of preferences, by the fact that some enjoy looking at books, others arms, some red cloths, others blue cloths, some are pleased with horses, others oxen. Similarly for hearing, others harps, others bagpipes, and still others songs. And likewise for the odor of musk, others that of amber, others camphor; still others prefer the odor of assa fetida [smelly roasts]. In relation to this, the tarantula receive the greatest pleasure from one music or zither, especially the melody called pelandra; others enjoy the aria called Dama di Provenza. For those who are bitten by them, their souls are joyous, and they recover and return to life, although another may be lightened. This is, in short, the answer to the query.9 treats De morsu tarantulae. Although this chapter appears in the index of the manuscript preserved in the National Library of Paris, but is missing from the text, it should be considered a demonstration that around the second half of the fourteenth century, tarantism was already widespread in its basic forms and began to be included as a traditional topic in the de venenis literature.

In the Sertum, there is no reference to the geographic localization of the phenomenon, but the omission is to be attributed with all probability to the fact that the Apulian localization was well known to all. Moreover, if the Sertum discusses the melodic connection between taranta and poisoned victim, the musical exorcism of the poisoning taranta, the connection of the bite and the melodic preferences connected to it, mentions neither a “musical exploration” nor a dance of the poisoned victim. Despite this, only with the musical exploration could the right melody be found from within a traditionalized repertory, and if at the moment in which such a melody was played, the tarantati came to and returned to life, it is legitimate to suppose that the reawakening at the sign of the rhythm could take on the form of a dance.

In the chronicles of Goffredo Malaterra and Albert d'Aix, which refer to episodes in the second half of the eleventh century, neither Apulia nor the treatment in the most suitable way is mentioned, but that when the sufferer receives great benefit, of the human species, for as demonstrated some enjoy horns, smell, some prefer one, another, for example, the sound of the lepote and the other musical instruments, melodies and songs. In this manner, when they hear sounds or songs which are pleasing, since cheerfulness is an excellent medicine for that, the cause of the enjoyment they feel is the songs, the spirits are attracted from the inside of the body to the periphery. This movement prevents the poison from penetrating the interior, with the consequence that the most important organs are not harmed, but the tarantism is at issue, but only taranta as the name given to animals whose bite was poisonous, be they spiders or snakes.

The episode of the siege of Palermo contains the warm oven cure, while the episode of the crusader army in Syria refers, among other things, to the erotic symbolism of the bite; but in each case, tarantism per se is absent. Nonetheless, the two medieval chronicles contain precious indication: in connection with the conflict between the Islamic and Christian worlds, the Western armies suffered memorable experiences of collective poisoning, and such experiences connected to real episodes of intoxication through poisonous animal bites in all likelihood furnished one of the initial stimuli for putting into motion the peculiar cultural formation that led to tarantism as a mythical-ritual symbol endowed with its own autonomy. Apulia itself was one of the frontier areas where the great conflict between the Christian and Islamic worlds took place. From the ninth century on, the Apulian coasts of the Adriatic and the Ionian became the scene of the conflict, and in the period of the Crusades, the Apulian ports—due to the abundance of ships they harbored—were preferred for the crusader armies’ passage to the Holy Land. Nor should we forget the harsh collective trials to which, in the same period, the populations of Southern Italy were exposed: sixteen plague epidemics from 1119 to 1340, lethal smallpox and measles, leprosy spread by the Crusades, the black death from 1347 to 1350, the collapse of trade, and [above all the great nightmare which loomed from the sea and which would cease only many centuries later, at the time of Charles III.

From the signs and indications taken as a whole, it is thus legitimate to conclude that the period of the development of Apulian tarantism approximately spanned the period from the ninth to the fourteenth centuries—between the height of Muslim expansion in the Mediterranean and the offensive return of the West. Moreover, the role of tarantism in the historical climate of the Middle Ages is suggested by other, more domestic considerations.

As we saw, tarantism is largely to be interpreted as the musical-choreutic exorcism of frustrated eros: an exorcism performed from May to August, in an arboreal and aquatic setting, in the protective shade of evergreens, or in orchards revived by a perennial spring. Now, the fin’amor, the perfect love of the Provencal troubadours and of courtly romance poetry and prose is also, though with much greater symbolic complexity, a nostalgic love of the self: a love that the poet-lover sets in a springtime scene of the locus amenus [amenable place] which includes trees and springs.

At least as a hypothesis which merits testing, this particular literary sensibility may have descended from refined lyrical poetry to popular tarantism through the mediation of songs from the repertory utilized during the exorcism, and it may have contributed to giving meaning and unity to this magical-religious institution. Even if we leave aside this hypothesis, in any case, an analogy of approach remains in reference to a common cultural Period.

As for the musical catharsis, we must recall that the Pythagorean tradition of correspondence between the musical harmony of the cosmos, the musical harmony of the soul and the body, and the music obtained with human instruments had entered into the Middle Ages through the De Musica of Boezio Boetius. It was then Christianized by St. Augustine through the identification of the cosmos, based on the numerus musicales.

In the Middle Ages, phlebotomy and hygiene were springtime “hygienic” measures, but they were understood as the restoration of an order not only somatic, but also psychic and moral, according to cathartic principles.

The literary text of Buonaiuto da Cosentino’s two compositions presents a continuous passage from one order to another, within the scope of Christian moralism. Removed unnecessary characters, separated wrongly appended words, and verified if numbers were part of a header or footer. Here is the corrected text:

The very order in which the discussion ison is placed in the Sertum is significant: this discussion follows pl nother one dealing with the poison of the basilisk and precedes one devoted ‘to hydrophobia. Now, if the poison of the basilisk belongs entirely to the bolic sphere, that of the rabid dog features a marked symbolic autonomy edieval ideology which makes it wholly dissimilar to what modern people by hydrophobia. On this symbolic level, it was appropriate to place the ik taranta and rabid dog next to one another, as in the order of the ‘Sertum, and indeed, tarantism and hydrophobia appeared next to one another in popular religious life. Saint Vitus, the same Saint responsible in Northern Europe for controlling sudden crises of choreutic agitation, in Southern Italy instead protected hydrophobes — not only those who were actually sufferers, but also “symbolic” hydrophobes, not unlike the symbolic bite victims of the taranta. In Apulia, the land of tarantism, and precisely in Polignano — which, at the beginning of the 1600s, witnessed the archbishop Giovanbattista Quinzato ose the challenge he had made with the taranta — there was a famous chapel of St. Vitus, where “hydrophobes” went in pilgrimage. The people of Apulia, Pontano says, walked through the city at night for three Saturdays in a row, reciting the following charm, whose ingenuous popular form can be guessed beneath the humanist’s Latin:

Alme, Vithe pellicane | Oram qui tenes Apulam | Litusque Polygnanicum, | qui morsus rabidos levas | irasque canum mitigas / tu, sancte, rabiem asperam | ristusque canis luridos, | tu saevam prohibe luem.

it bIIS

The reference to Saint Vitus contains another important medieval relationship with tarantism, that of the so-called “choreutic epidemics” which unsettled Europe in that period. The advent and expansion of Christianity had caused a crisis of the mythical-ritual horizons of the ancient world. In particular, it marked the dissolution of orgiastic cults and maenadism as regularly functioning institutions integrated with hegemonic cultural forms. Christianity definitively broke the substantial dynamic unity of relation and development that linked the most unrefined forms of popular catharsis to the mystery religions, Pythagorean and Orphic-Pythagorean speculation, the reshaping of tragedy, the Platonic reflections on mania telestica and those of Aristotle on catharsis. The new teligious civilization in expansion had forged a path which would fill the gap only to the degree that it managed to actually shape custom according its own model and find provisional compromises, temporary tolerances and useful connections between the high and the /ow, in such a way that these did not fundamentally threaten the dynamic unity of the shaping process.

It was the Apostle Paul, himself who, in a certain sense, had the most acute and dramatic conflict with this aspect of the antithesis. On the road to Damascus, he encountered a deity, and “at midday” he experienced the irresistible “luminous and tumultuous visions of bells and tambourines vibrating in the face of the interior moral os Christian agape.” And if for present-day historiographic consciousness the bits contained their own order, their telestic madness, for the combatant nose as consciousness they necessarily formed an absolute negativity, like Saul’s temptation.

Moreover, the new “goad” experienced by the Apostle in his journey to Damascus was opposed to the older one in another respect, as it belonged to the male world, and to the female one only in a subordinate and mediated form. During the polemic so vigorously carried out in the first chapters of the Corinthians, Paul establishes a well-known hierarchy: if God is the head of Christ, and Christ is the leader of man, then man is the leader of woman; therefore, woman reflects God through the mediation of man. This prioritization is not gratuitous, but serves the Apostle in order to justify a precise description regarding the behavior of women in liturgical assemblies: while man, the image and glory of God, can sit in church with his head uncovered, woman — who is the glory of man and his private treasure — must be covered as a sign of her subjection to God through her subjection to man. "The cultural image of the maenad, as Greek tragedy and iconography have passed down to us, was thus refused by the Christian order: the requirement of the shaved head during the liturgical assembly in fact founded a model of behavior antithesis with that of tresses that flowed freely in the rhythm of a frenetic dance, in the same way that, in the Gospel of John, the silent, interior pain of Maria at the foot of the Cross founded a model of behavior in antithesis to that of the pagan lamentresses.“"

It is in this wider perspective that we should consider the so-called choreutic epidemics of the Middle Ages, whose trunk received the grafting of Apulian tarantism. In general, the fight waged against the pagan cults by expanding Christianity and the substitution of the dates and places where pagan holidays were celebrated with corresponding Christian ones, contributed in a first period and especially in rural areas to aggravate the psychic disorders for which the pagan holidays were an organic horizon of control and reintegration.

The religious life of the pagan agrarian community had mourned the treatment of these disorders — manifest or latent — on holiday times connected to critical moments of particular importance for individual and collective life, such as the winter solstice, the spring reawakening of the vegetation, the summer solstice and the period of the harvest. But now the Christian holidays which had taken the place of the pagan ones risked being unsettled by the sudden insurgence of psychic disorders, rendered all the more serious by the fact that Christian civilization had declared war on the ancient Pagan forms of cultural discipline.

In particular, the feast-days of St. John (June 24) and St. Vitus (June 15) — both connected to the harvest period — were, on a European-wide scale, subject to the subversive and relapsing temptations of the tisis. This forced the Church to consider the problem of readapting these two feast-days in such a way as to put new horizons of control into action which Nysc, too was Strug] goad" (Kentronye: But while | was journeying on this business to Damascus with auth from the chief priests, at midday, O king, | saw on the way a light than the sunshine round about me and my companions. We all fe heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew, “Saul, Saul, why dost thou pi for thee to kick against the goad...”

"Here, however, the distance from the kentron and from the 0 the bacchantes is immense. The distance lies not so much in the initial crisis, as in the orientation of the crisis itself, the reintegration announces, and the cultural values read against the horizon of the deity that has given a sign of itself. Most of all, the distance lies in the Consciousness that the emergence of these values can also begin with a crisis that throws one to the ground, but fully belongs to the deployment of the moral ene. agape, to the hegemony of the nous [mind] which communicates with others and edifies them: istros of To ay Charity never fails, whereas prophecies will disappear, and tongues will cease, ¢ knowledge will be destroyed.

So there abide faith, hope, and charity—these three. But the greatest of these is charity." And further: "Aim at charity, he who speaks is speaking and encourages others to strive after the spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy. If a tongue does not speak to men but to God; for no one understands mysteries in his spirit. But he who prophesies speaks to men for edification and consolation. He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but who prophesies edifies the church. Now I should like you all to speak in tongues, but more to prophesy, for he who prophesies is greater than he who speaks in tongues, as he can interpret so that the church may receive edification."

(Ciphered language, ecstatic speaking in tongues, whether one's own tongue or incomprehensible way or foreign languages, can also mark the beginning of a relationship with God. But the benefit that the clarifying and communicating mind receives from it is supreme: ten thousand ciphered words are not worth five words pronounced with nous which also instruct others.)

The Pauline polemic against the spiritual anarchy of the church of Corinth in favor of a God who is not a god of disorder, but serenity, struck at the heart of the orgiastic cults, which appeared to the Apostle as chaos.

The Biblical citations in English translation are from the Revised Challoner-Rheims Version of De Martino (1958), which treats this Christian break with pagan lament forms at great length in his (1951) by the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine (Chicago: The Catholic Press).

Morte e Pianto rituale nel Mondo Antico. op. cit. 220 HISTORICAL COMMENTARY

substituted the ancient ones: canonical exorcism and the penitential reshaping of the crisis were the means ordinarily employed by the Church to deal with the situation. But at the same time, the Church could not avoid the fact that in one way or another, either through spontaneous rebirth, the regulatory intervention of civil authorities, or even by compromises and tolerance of the clergy itself, the old forms of choreutic-musical discipline reemerged together with other legacies of the pagan cults.

In the earliest accounts of the choreutic epidemics of Northern Europe, the phenomenon is presented as mere psychic disorder, seasonally conditioned, which suddenly exploded and infected entire collectivities. One example of this type must have been the agitation which took hold of the faithful who on Christmas of 1021, attended Mass in the church of Kolbig. A substantially analogous character is displayed in the famous choreutic epidemic which began in Aachen in 1347 on the occasion of the feast-day of St. John, and which then spread throughout the entire Rhine basin, reaching Liége, Utrecht, Tongern, Kölhn, and Metz. There were throngs of possessed people, regardless of age and sex, whose frenzied agitation had nothing of the ritual dance. The chronicles, moreover, do not give importance to the intervention of a musical discipline, but dwell instead on the subversive character of this daemonica pestis, which struck men and women, maxime paupers et levis opinionis, ad magnum omnium terrorem. It even appeared that the entire social and cultural order was at stake when the possessed of Liége were seen assembled in tightly-knit groups, spewing insults on the priests who had gathered for the exorcisms; and during an exorcism, one of the possessed let his demon say that the evil spirits planned to pass from the bodies of the poor to those of the wealthy, and then to those of the princes, to overturn the clergy and take possession of its goods: a plan which anticipated in a sinister manner by nearly two centuries what would take place, through quite different means, in the period of the Reformation. The sinister, subversive power of the crisis’s diffusion in every social class is reflected, though with probable exaggeration, in the description we read in the Chronicle of Metz: Le Prétre en faisant son service / le Juge séant en justice / le Laboreur en son labeur, / dansoient, sautoient, mais en doleur."2

Subsequently, the musical catharsis began to acquire special importance, for example in the choreutic epidemic which broke out in Strasbourg in 1518. Many people danced to the sound of pipes and drums; to deal with the disorder, the municipal council of the city instituted places for dance on the premises of the corporations and merchants, procuring musicians and dancers in sufficient number to take turns in the difficult task of making the agitated and the possessed dance until they fell unconscious. The dance was even performed in a cave transformed into a chapel of St. Vitus, near Zabern, and took place around the altar until the dancers (male or female) fell to the ground at the base: especially the poor and those lacking judgment, to the great terror of all.

The Priest holding service / the Judge presiding justice / the Laborer in his toil / they danced: they jumped, but in anguish.

THE MEDIEVAL ORIGINS OF TARANTISM

221

The crisis of St. Vitus was considered a sort of bewitchment or black magic, and by 1485, curses like Gott geb dir Sankt Veit (God send you "Gaint Vitus) or Dass dich Sankt Veit ankdme (may St. Vitus come to you) were nishable, as we learn from the legislation of the city of Rottweil. A subsequent account by the physician Gregorio Horstius of Ulm tells us that the crisis of St. Vitus was ceremonially shaped so that it was repeated annually with the approach of the feast-day, and each year it involved a choreutic-musical cure in the Chapel: {remember speaking last spring with some women who each year visit the chapel of St. Vitus located in Drefelhausen, not far from Geislingen, near Weissenstein, in the territory of Ulm. These women dance day and night with their senses altered, until they fall into ecstasy; in this way it seems that they are cured, so that they hardly have any disturbances the entire year, until the following May, the month in which they are afflicted by an agitation of their limbs, as they say, and are thus compelled anew to go to the temple of the feast of St. Vitus, the said place of dance. One of these women had to dance every year in the Chapel of St. Vitus for twenty years and more, another for thirty-two years...'°

This last account renders the affinities with Apulian tarantism particularly evident. Nonetheless, the choreutic forms of Northern Europe are completely lacking in the musical symbolism of the taranta that bites and poisons, inducing corresponding melodic aversions or inclinations in the poisoned victim. As we read here and there in the chronicles, even when chromatic repulsions appeared in the crisis, especially to red, they remained mere impulses and did not have anything to do with the chromatic symbolism of the taranta. Also lacking is the order of a musical exploration from within a traditionalized repertory of music and song, nor is there any trace of the symbolism of the tree, the swing, the mirror, at least from what the chronicles tell us. Moreover, the curing efficacy of the rhythm of dance and melody must have been relatively scant, and from what we are able to gather from the documents, the behavior of those called “dancers” of St. 

John or St. Vitus must not have differed substantially from the uncontrolled paroxysm of the crisis itself. On this, we have the account of the physician Hermann Griiber of Liibeck, who observed that while the tarantati danced only at the call of the music and ceased to do so as soon as the music was interrupted, the dancers of St. John and St. Vitus abandoned themselves to prodigious runs and jumps “independently of the music”:'” that is, they were prey to a psychomotor agitation upon which the music was unable to impose the order of rhythm and proper choreutic figures. In other words, from the comparison of the two accounts we find that tarantism possessed a wider cultural autonomy, its own specific symbolic elaboration and a more stable reintegrating efficacy. In this way, tarantism appeared as a regularly functioning institution, while the “dance” of St. John and St. Vitus seemed - much poorer in institutional significance, and much closer to the character of single memorable episodes of terrifying collective psychic disorders, whatever their nature was.

What does gain importance from the historical-religious point of view, if anything, is the Church’s recourse to exorcism and the shaping of 222 HISTORICAL COMMENTARY the crisis into a penitential practice, on the Saints (St. John, St. Vitus, St. Willibrord). . ee with the so-called “choreutic epidemics” of Northern B _ ian tarantism is thus distinguished by its own culturally shaped fe, ae d : a magical-religious institution, it drew one of its stimuli from real e; in et throughout the region, but elaborated its symbol with rel tien ee ee together elements originating from the relia ‘ ton of Magna Grecia into a new functional unity: 4 “ a Gr unity: the symbolj , the oistros and the aidresis, the tree and water, the milton and ee ait a especially the tradition of musical catharsis.

After the obscure period of its formation as a particular mythical-ritual symbol, ‘Apulian tarantism entered the highest cultural consciousness of the West for first time through the De venenis literature, which continued that of the ‘Hellenistic era on the same subject; given the character of this medieval literary e, tarantism made its entry into it maintaining numerous connections to popular ideology. The author of Sertum acknowledges in an immediate way the influence of the Christian holidays which oth the poisonous power of the taranta and the efficacy of the musical cure, ‘and he utilizes medical categories of the period to explain the therapeutic action of the music. We see here in an embryonic form the two directions which the cultural interest in tarantism would take in subsequent centuries: a primarily musicological interest in the effects of music on the body and on the human mind, and a medical interest in the characteristics of the illness and its causes.

The first direction developed in connection with the relationship _ between music and medicine in the period of Humanism and the Renaissance, and it found its most characteristic and committed manifestation around the mid-seventeenth century in the work of the Jesuit Atanasio Kircher. The second direction, more strictly medical, received particular impetus from the - monographs of Epifanio Ferdinando and Baglivi; it became almost exclusive _ due to the influence of the Neapolitan school of medicine from Cornelio to Serao, and due to the subsequent contributions of medicine in the positivist period, right up to the present day. But let us examine this instructive cultural development more closely. In the age of Humanism, the renewed way of relating to the classical world had, among its consequences, the new success of Hippocratic humoral pathology and the revival of Pythagorean and Platonic ideas regarding the importance of music. Combined with natural magic, these two classical legacies gave rise to a symbolic system of correspondences which gained great favor in late Renaissance musical theory and in Baroque iatromusic.

The four elements (earth, water, air, fire) corresponded in the microcosm of the human body to four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile), and in the order of the passions, to four temperaments (sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric and melancholic). In this framework, health was defined as the harmony of the humors and illness their disharmony; therefore, instrumental music could influence the state of health or illness by virtue of its four fundamental musical modes (Mixolydian, Dorian, Lydian and Phrygian), which musical theoreticians from the sixteenth century on sought to connect with the system of correspondences of the four tances, like the disarticulation of the ancie the spring reawakening and the period of the greater aggressiveness, and finally, substituted the pagan ones in the mae ome to Te their functional legacy.

In this tefashioning, Apulisdom is connected in various ways to medieval i in the literary theme of frustrated love celebrated in the / and the spring, the “musical offerings” ing "parpes” or fa: Eerings” for the spring “purges” or j of illness, the relationships in the de venenis ncaral P veneficium-maleficium of the d is li ' and, we might add, the symbolism i i wideapreadalll c: of the mirror which i i Middle Ages, as is well known. i i etalon oe n.

In any case, from the iatromusical perspective, tarantism represented the most striking example in existence that could corroborate the authority of the traditional classical examples with the authority of a directly observable phenomenon, and this explains why the most famous iatromusician of the Baroque era, the Jesuit Atanasio Kircher, Kircher, repeatedly devoted a magical treatment to the subject.

TARANTISM, NATURAL MAGIC AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 225

Upon a superficial examination, Kircher's work seems entirely enthralled with the most spectacular forms of natural magic: all that was rare, hidden, aradoxical, prodigious and occult that struck the ears, eyes and mind immediately became worthy of collection, observation, ingenious imitation, a stimulus to the discovery of occult correspondences. However, after the era of Galileo, Bacon and Descartes, natural magic had lost its historical significance as a rupture of the closed hierarchy of the medieval universe* and the admission into the demiurgic human sphere of forces which for the Middle Ages appeared as demoniacal temptation. In Kircher, the bridge which had mediated the passage from low ceremonial magic to Baconian knowledge as power now served to carry out an opposite connection with the popular and plebian supernatural through the mental categories of natural magic. In a sense, Kircher carries out the Counter-Reformation exorcism of natural magic, the attempt to furnish a great synthesis of natural magic purged of any dangerous questioning. The true caricature of a Renaissance man, Kircher was interested in everything, almost everywhere displaying judgments which suffered in comparison with the cultural level attained in his day: among other things, he was an assiduous defender of the notion of plague as the devil's handiwork, flagellum et sagitta dei [scourge and thunderbolt of God], and he shared with the Neapolitan people and the clergy the belief in the apparition of mysterious crosses on the underclothes and flesh of those who remained unscathed by the plague of 1656. He was a doctor, mathematician, physicist, musicologist, optician, microscopist, and Orientalist; he published an illustrated book on China and unearthed some Coptic texts, publishing them with a commentary. In Rome, he held the chair of mathematics and Hebrew language at the Collegio Romano and founded a cabinet of curiosities (which later became the Kircherian museum) in which he gathered instruments of physics, peculiar machines of his own invention, musical instruments, ethnographic objects, clocks, and natural history collections. His work was controversial, with some contemporaries judging him a dreamer and an impostor. Kircher's interest in Apulian tarantism must be seen in the context of his attempt to gather everything related to universal magic and the occult magnetism of the universe, particularly the prodigious healing effects of music.

Kircher distinguished three types of prodigious cures: supernatural, work of demons, and natural prodigy. Miraculous healings generally belong to the first type, while ceremonial magic cures based on implicit or explicit pacts with demons fall into the second type. The third type features prodigious healings obtained by "natural" means, as in the case of tarantism. Kircher embraced the ideological elements of tarantism in Apulian popular tradition, through connections with informants from Lecce and Taranto and treatises on Musurgia and Phonurgia.

Tarantism gained intense cultural circulation in magical-natural literature, despite its decline. However, it maintained its integrity as a cultural phenomenon and remained preserved in an academic perspective. Kircher's work provided valuable ideological data on tarantism, even if it was from the perspective of someone participating in its immediate context. He also preserved the literary texts of the songs and, with the exception of Pietro Storace, the only musical examples available. Tarantism faced a different fate in the second mode of evaluation, the more strictly medical one. 

If the iatromusical traditions — the ties) horizon of natural magic, basically moved on the same = nf mind seine a continuation of its orientation, medical science of ee = cig teenth centuries brought about a radical change with oe Perspective Operating in Popular tarantism. Within the limits of i genitive categories, medical science was in fact inclined to test the popular ideology of tarantism on its own level, that of the new science of ean et it fall by the wayside when it turned out to be unacceptable on that evel In this was the reduction of tarantism to disease had its beginning: judgment on tarantism became the clinical description and diagnosis of cases, and the popular ideology was progressively belittled. On the level of this medical “reduc ip eon might have been essentially either a toxic state deriving from the a yal eee arachnid ora psychic disorder, or a combination of the two ings: the rest, starting with the musical cure, was by then destined to become gradually and increasingly extraneous to the Perspective adopted In the first decades of the 1600s there were some scholars who occasionally considered tarantism as melancholiae seu amentiae species [melancholy or a form of madness]; but Epifanio Ferdinando, who was the first to follow this new conn efficacy of the choreutic-musical therapy. By then, however, the emphasis of the sesearch lay on testing the popular tradition in terms of naturalistic observation, and no longer on the justification of such a tradition in the framework of natu! data furnished by his informants from Lecce and Taranto to be sufficient; but Epifanio Ferdinando, born in Mesagne,” observed the tarantati at length in his hometown, and treated the subject ina commentary toa particular clinical case, that of Simone Messapiense, “adolescent of a hot-humid temperament, bitten by the zaranta on the left hypochondrium while he was sleeping in the fields at night, as was his custom.” Giorgio Baglivi, an Apulian by adoption if not pirth, was another doctor who linked his name to the systematic treatment of - tarantism. He repeated the popular tradition that the taranta was poisonous, that the tarantati were poisoned by her bite, and that the music and dance healed them: even more than in Epifanio Ferdinando, we can perceive in Baglivi a position oriented toward diligent clinical observation. framework of magnetism, iatromusie agnes, TARANTISM, NATURAL MAGIC AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 227 ‘direction systematically, still retained from the ideology of tarantism the real ection between the bite of the Apulian tarantula and the crisis, as well as the ral magic. For a justification of this sort, Kircher found the second-hand Precisely because of his diligence as an observer, Baglivi had to recognize that not all of the tarantati were poisoned by the taranta. To get out of this fix, he devised the distinction of the two tarantisms: the “real” one provoked by the bite of the taranta, and the “false” one, which the mulierculae exploited to celebrate their little carnivals. This distinction subsequently became the norm for fitting whatever resisted the reduction of tarantism to disease into a medical perspective: what was left over from the reduction was polemically belittled as “false” or “fake” tarantism, as fanaticism or superstition. In this way, Baglivi brought about a real, radical departure from the previous perspective, which still held in an immediate way to popular beliefs in the “wondrous” properties of the taranta and the no less “wondrous” properties of the healing music; even when, as in the case of Pontano, this earlier perspective unscrupulously exercised the right to criticism on popular belief, it still concentrated______ Once put into motion, the demon of the observation and experiment could no longer be stopped; and if for the moment it had not undermined the popular belief in the poison of the Apulian taranta, it was inevitable that sooner or later it would weaken it at its very foundations. It would discover that the Apulian tarantula was not in question and judge to be correct those who, from the time of Epifanio Ferdinando on, suspected tarantism to be a sort of melancholy and amentia. This new path of research was promoted by the Neapolitan school of medicine in the second half of the seventeenth century.

Once again, the vicissitudes of tarantism in the cultural consciousness were tied to an era and a historical conditioning: in this specific case, to the renewal of Neapolitan cultural life after the plague of 1656, and after Tommaso Cornelio introduced the works of Gassendi°, Bacon, Hobbes and Descartes. The causal relationship between the new climate and the drive to renew the study of Apulian tarantism was explicitly asserted by another illustrious representative of the cultural perspective forming in Naples at that time, the physician and humanist, Francesco Serao. Writing in 1742, Serao recalled that it was an era in which most scholars of philosophy had once again assumed skepticism. In that period, between the efforts to regulate those who saw themselves stripped of it, and the insults of the self-favorite school to destroy them and send them to Perdition, rows, altercations, and sometimes even incivilities and calumnies, perhaps no less than any other place in Europe, was the famous Salentine town. Some of them are still recalled vividly, tracked down by the interested parties in the diary, familiar to everyone. In such a state of things, brains, no one could possibly neglect to touch the issue of Apulian tarantism.

The new cultural movement was distinctly anti-represented by the philosophy of the cloister and Scholasticism, the principle of authority and the li they represented that Counter-Reformation involution of natural magic, which by then had become an obstacle to the advancement of science. In Naples, Kircherism represented this natural magic, which had lost its original historical meaning, and among the "clamorous tidings" for which Kircherism acted as town crier, tarantism was one of many calls to battle for the innovators. Tommaso Cornelio had already ridiculed Kircher's claims of the plague as the devil's handiwork and, in 1677, published a letter in England, mentioned above, in which he expressed the question continued to be dealt with in mere disciple of Cornelio, Bernardino Clarizio, wanted to perform an experiment in public, which Serao describes for us:

Two doctors of distinct reputation, Bernardino Clarizio and the other, one day (in the month of August in the year 1693) met by chance in the well-stocked bookshop of the famous Antonio Bulifon, where in that period the best men of letters in the country used to gladly converge. The former was one of the best students of Cornelio, the latter the author of a brief note containing the history of the Apulian tarantula, written in not very fine taste, to nearly all the most obscure news of the plebes, tarantula and the strange effects of its poison. On the doctors, passing from one discussion to the next, and from dispute to the next, became quite heated, and each took his opinion so far, that in the presence of Bulifon himself and the several worthy men, they came to a bizarre agreement to get to the bottom of the matter. A public notary's hand elaborated the paper which declared that Clarizio would: under the eyes of this very assembly, have himself bitten by a tarantula.

Let us return to Serao, who in his Lezioni of 1742 was the most responsible representative of this anti-Kircherian line of research on Apulian tarantism. A disciple of Niccolé Cirillo, chief physician of the University of Naples and protomedico for the Kingdom, Serao formed his thought above all through _ Gassendism and the works of Galileo, Borelli* and Torricelli. His Lezioni on the Apulian tarantula, held at the Academy of Sciences at the suggestion of Ferdinando Galiani, were published for the first time in Naples in 1742. Humanist that he was, Serao a ee ae i in and Italian, but he wanted his book to in, unl I OU ccncgracks which had treated the subject up to that point. dd means of expression, he wanted to show that the truth he —, sowie not only be circulated among scholars, but also illuminate the general publi = modify popular tradition itself, precisely in the spirit of the — — which had taken place in Bulifon's bookshop nearly fifty years earlier. - : Serao's Lezioni contain the first attempt at a history of opinions on a ne Teview and critical evaluation of what had been written to date on t - = After having listed the first authors to have dealt with the topic — e _ = D'Alessandro, Galateo and Berni — Serao mentions the fame of tara throughout Europe: Now, kind academicians, do not expect me to hold you at bay any longer, oat ao places where authors have spoken of our tarantula.

As th the new disease of our Apulians bitten by the tarantula spreads further and fi through the trade of foreigners with our own People and the publication of ; aforementioned writers and of others of equal celebrity and fame, you yourseil at be persuaded that this belief has become increasingly universal from town to tod year to year, reaching even the most remote nations of Europe. We are assured by the notes we read in writers of the greatest authority and diverse Professions eae find —— having to speak either of poisonous animals or the efficg d js was the cultural perspective which Serao held and which guided him in or controlling certain illnesses, or other similar subjects judgment of tarantism. As for the facts of the matter, he limited himself to an is not t d estigation” which he organized though his numerous Apulian correspondents the distinction between the two great cultural periods to which they bel; ad the results of some “experiments” on the poison of the taranta bite. But the old and the new, that of the principle of authority and that of Teason q n here, what interests us is not so much the medical value of these data and critique. And this is how he judges Fathers Nicolello and Galliberto and g these experiments as the general orientation of his research. Serao had no 4 culty in capturing the contradictions which ensnared those who stubbornly ted on reducing tarantism to the poisonous bite of the raranta. ‘Ridiculing the description of the symptoms of tarantism, as found in Epifanio Ferdinando, he observes: highest consideration and rose to the greatest fame were the ones who had been successful in this demolition of old opinions. And if this happened with so many er subjects of minor importance, as would appear from the philosophical history of at period, just think how much greater their boldness would have been toward the seceived wisdom on tarantism, a phenomenon which was real to the eyes of the most foolish people of every period, astonishing and troublesome!" It is not the listing of different opinions which interests Serao, but j From them, Kircher learned everything that came from the Apulians’ mouths abou Presumed disease of tarantism; and all this was passed off to him as utterly true ar hundred times proven in some individual or another, in this precise place, in these or the No diseases, symptoms or injuries to health have ever existed in the world: everything ‘is passed off as tarantism, not only things which differ greatly among themselves, but also those which are quite often opposites... and so it seems to me that a sharp and malicious contradictor could object that in Apulia, and in the summer, all the diseases Were tarantism, just as every bird of August is a garden warbler, and just like Calandrino, _ who searching throughout the Mugnone for Heliotrope, saw it in every stone, since the _ description that he had of it corresponded to all of them. £"* Paragraphs of Father Kircher's dissertations.3” As evidence of this, he cites Samuel Hafenreffer, a professor of medicine at the Academy of Ulm, having mentioned the phalangid in his discussion of "afflictions of the skin" and poisonous animal bites. Hafenreffer immediately "went on to copy Kircher's dissertation word for word."38 Serao also references Kircher's disciple and collaborator, Gaspare Schott, who in his synopsis of universal magic, compiled for a project which his master was unable to complete, copied everything that the master had written about tarantism.39 Nonetheless, Serao does not think that tarantism can be reduced to a sort of criminal "fraud" of the Apulian common folk, and with singular prudence, he cautions that the problem is more complex, and some of the innovators, swept by the polemic against Kircherism, were wrong to fall into the opposite excess of negating everything.

But I want to say something else to you, and I will say what very reliable stories and letters of friends refer as happening in Apulia daily. There, of every ten sick people, men and women, whether the illness is chronic or acute, it suffices that for some obstinacy of the illness or some not very ordinary or common symptom, there is reason to reflect a bit and investigate the nature of the illness itself and its causes; in these circumstances, I say, of every ten sick people, eight are certainly believed to be tarantati. Musicians are brought to them, and what I find most significant is that all eight, to a greater or lesser extent according to their strengths, will set about dancing or at least gesticulate in bed as best they can. The people are left with the very strong opinion that these are true farantati, even when there is no way whatsoever to understand how this poison got into their bodies.

From a blind, most servile esteem in which men long held the doctrines of their elders, the intellect's eyes began to open and doubt the beliefs and theories in the notes of natural history left by them. Yet, in this as in all other changes and in the revolution of affairs, it happens that we willingly pass from one extreme to another without knowing how to halt in an praiseworthy middle ground. This is true in the art of judging physical matters: either due to an innocent skepticism or the insult of others – and to carry out a vendetta on pristine, indolent credulity, many learned men judged that they were better off negating with audacity than doubting with temerity. Those who were held in esteem by Serao were aware of the difficulties of those who sought to reduce the taranta to a Zoological species and who, like Baglivi, found that even the scorpion could provoke tarantism.

If we now ask why the scorpions of Apulia are a cause of true tarantism with their sting, we must answer together with the aforementioned Ferdinando that the occult force of the Apulian sky falls upon them, just as it falls on tarantulas and influences them. And if a reference to the foolish character in Bocaccio's Decameron (Day Eight, Third Novella) is needed, the Mugnone is a Tuscan valley, and heliotrope, or bloodstone, was thought to confer magical powers, especially invisibility. A typographical error in the original reads "Hefenreffer," but the name is reported correctly in the notes. 

And perhaps even others..." 8 does ng bite of snap, By virtue of these considerations, Serao concluded that the cause of ta was not to be sought in the tarantula, but in the Apulians, and that va, animals and diseases entered into the question in obliquio, while the Ap entered into it in recto. Those Apulians whom Valletta had already dens. as impatient in keeping still, almost as if they had been stung by th and thus needing to use music and dance to free “a certain interior wej oppression,” a melancholy which prevailed in these lands, When they subject to extreme disorders, in extreme moments, the Apulians resopy the institution of tarantism, heir to the ancient orgiastic cults: sometimes 4 resorted to it in the extreme moment per excellence, the approach of death, defeat Kircherism definitively, but would also lead to the death of the pop t Apulian tradition itself. Tommaso Fasano, in his Vita del Serao published ‘a0’s lessoy he does not hesitate to then proclaim that “since [the lessons] appeared, entertainment to which the bite victims of the tarantula abandoned themsel} in summertime in our area slowly became rarer and then disappeared entirely” Napoli-Signorelli repeated the same Judgment some time later.'?” which y taken literally by foreign scholars and led many of them to believe that the 1700s on there was no longer any trace of tarantism in Apulia.'* To, considering the uninterrupted documentation of tarantism during the enti nineteenth century, after the observations of De Raho which demonstrate th the phenomenon was relatively significant in 1908, and after our fieldwork in summer of 1959, this premature death Certificate might amuse us as unscien’ boasting, were our judgment not tempered by the historical evaluation of Enlightenment faith in the transformative power of the scholar’s ideas, and b the prestige of a master like Serao. Even so, whatever the reasons behind tl erroneous affirmation, it unconsciously contained a grain of truth, because i effect Serao’s Lezioni and the cultural movement of which it was a part h definitively removed the residual “learned” support for tarantism by natural magic and Kircherism, making the conflict between the “myth” of the tarante and the new science of nature erupt irreparably. This conflict not only clearh had its beginning with the Lezioni, but was also communicated to a much wider learned circle than the strictly medical one, spreading throughout the provinces — of the Kingdom and even reaching the melancholy dominion of the faranta. The aforementioned Carducci, Florentine by birth and patrician of the city 0} Taranto, approved of Serao’s ideas in his commentary to Deliciae Tarantina TARANTISM, NATURAL MAGIC AND THE ENLIGHTENMENT 233 ino. He qualified tarantism as an “institution of the ar ip SE ocr by prejudice, imitation and custom,” as the remains of the cults 4 hus and Cybele, “only in its beginning and in other circumstances Epace sed by the bite of some ferocious phalangid, not immediately and through operties, but accompanying the aforementioned internal . ne 4 i i diate tie of popular tarantism w! »14 In this way, every immediat c want ! . els of Sarai life was sundered, and this meant confining it to es — .

Christianity had to make concessions to win over the population. The festival days of classical antiquity were maintained, transforming into commemorative days; churches were built atop the ruins of temples, and saints took on the functions and attributes of pagan divinities. However, the Church could not approve the orgiastic rites of the Dionysian cult; it had to combat them. These rituals, appealing to the most primitive instincts, were deeply rooted and survived. People met in secret to abandon themselves to the ancient dances and connected activities. The meaning of the dance transformed during the Middle Ages, when the old rituals appeared as symptoms of a disease to justify the music, dance, and orgiastic behavior. Tarantism was reduced to disease in the minds of the learned, and it underwent a transformation, becoming a unified horizon of cultural reintegration. Conflict already lay in the Christian polemic against the orgiastic cults of Antiquity. The Enlightenment cut the ties and gave rise to the irreconcilable conflict between the popular ideology of the taranta and the new science. The decline of the cultural circulation of tarantism began, along with its progressive folkloric isolation and its gradual reduction to a "relic" and "fragment" in the learned consciousness and reality. The slow decadence was influenced by the Chapel of St. Paul, which contributed to the process. The slowness of the process and the chapel's role in it are evidence of the uncertainty and contradictory means of shaping custom in those days, the serious obstacles faced by the rural plebes in their social and economic conditions, and how lazily the motion toward shaping Modern civilization operated in the South, mainly depending on the center of diffusion represented by Neapolitan cultural life from the second half of the 1600s on.

Ludovico Valletta, Celestine monk and native of Lucera,* conducted a iligent field study at the beginning of the 1700s, comparing and examining he responses of several informants when the data did not come from direct ation. Rejecting the validity of the "clamorous experiment" of Bernardino Lario with the usual argument that the phalangids transported from Apulia to Naples must have lost their toxic properties, he confirmed Baglivi's thesis of "true" tarantism provoked by the poisonous bite of the saranta, existing side by side with a pseudo-tarantism reducible to melancholy; he added, moreover, cases of outright diabolic possession (permulti in Apulia sunt qui vulgo tarantati sensentur et vere a Daemone possidentur).

Around the same period in which erao's Lezioni were published, Nicola Caputo, a physician in Lecce who was another member of the Neapolitan Academy, confirmed the real venomousness of the Apulian tarantula and the efficacy of the choreutic-musical therapy, on the basis of some twenty-odd clinical cases directly observed in the Salento; he dedicated part of his discussion, too, to the miraculous cure through St. Paul's intercession.

The very thing which had favored the success of Serao's Lezioni — that is, its theoretical value in the polemic against the magical-natural interpretation endorsed by Kircherism — also formed the limit of its persuasive efficacy. fundamentally, the positive basis on which the Lezioni rested was very modest and uncertain, and if the author of the Magnes and the Musurgia could be reproached for having utilized the indirect reports of two brethren, it could be objected that the author of the Lezioni had based his work solely on the letters of his Apulian correspondents, without ever having worked — as we would say today — "in the field," just as Epifanio, Baglivi, Valletta and Caputo had done. The Lezioni read like a forensic brief, rich in eloquence and discursive refinement: but directly observed clinical cases were called for in medical treatises, and Serao was in no condition to advance any.

It could be suspected that Epifanio, Baglivi, Valletta and Caputo had carried out their observations badly, but another suspicion weighed upon Serao's Lezioni: that he tended to overlook the clinical cases and the observations of those who had actually worked in the field. There have been learned disputes on the existence of the poison in the tarantula, and whether such poison is imaginary and fatuous, which he could assure, having done an tryp with Orn Wee veal imagination, it is beyond doubt that the persons bitten by this insect, particularly the plebeians, abandon themselves to the liveliest dance. But if this is an illusion in the contentment of the unfortunate class, condemned to fatigue and poverty, it forms the inverse of the oratorical belief in the death of tarantial consequences, as a result of the theories of the Neapolitan school of medicine. In perspective, both one side and its reverse become documents of a history of the energy to shape civil order and custom in Southern society.

Among other things, from a farce presented in Florence in the autumn of 1684 by the Andolfati company, we see that the question still remains unresolved, and that it had become the object of playful cues in theaters throughout the peninsula. Due to the farce's success, it was included in a collection of "tragedies, comedies, dramas and farces which currently enjoy the greatest favor with the public theaters, both Italian and foreign."

In fact, the three doctors arrive: Cassia, Manna and Acquafredda. They observe the symptoms, exchanging occasional glances that are "magisterial and mysterious," as befitting their profession. While they prepare their prescription, Alerio bursts onto the scene, and turning to the audience, says: "To enter in the dance from the shadows, the sound of the flute, which is sweet, and then the sound of the violin, which is louder but these two generally do not have sufficient strength since they are too delicate. One moves on to the brass instruments, which never fail to produce the desired effects. To dance, and dances with such vehemence that he falls to the ground due to his exhaustion; then he is cured, and he is entirely free of swelling and very healthy. While he dances, the different tarantulas continue to dance, and they dance until they die. Further, so long as the sick person wants, it is necessary for the bystanders to dance together with him, otherwise he would lose his temper with much harm. This is the true and simple medication for those bitten by the tarantula."

Musical exploration begins, performed by some musicians Valerio has brought with him: they begin with the flute, then pass to the violin, while Giannicola storms about because neither the music nor the instrument is congenial to his taranta. So Valerio announces the infallible experiment, the exploration with the violin, drum, and cowbell; but to culminate the insult towards a historicist perspective, Valerio places the instruments in the doctors' hands and forces them to perform the musical cure. In the meantime, as Valerio has announced, Giannicola begins to dance, first slowly and then faster, at first alone and then singing in a couple with one or another of those present, while the spiders secompany the dance "and they all drop dead one after another." Finally, Giannicola falls to the ground, cured, and full of gratitude, he grants Valerio the hand of his daughter.

"The farce's scene of the doctors forced to play music for a tarantato recalls the Bishop of Polignano drawn in spite of himself to dance like a tarantato. But if Epifanio Ferdinando, in the first decades of the seventeenth century, reports this episode in all seriousness in the grave context of a medical observation, the authors of the eighteenth-century farce are nothing if not innocent creations to amuse the audience, which shows how, with changing times, the whole question of tarantism was becoming a stimulus for satire for theater people and an opportunity for entertaining audiences. Let us leave aside the audiences (whose attitudes do, however, form a document for the historian of cultural life) and turn to the scholars. The Neapolitan school of medicine, especially due to the work of Francesco Serao, had come very close to the correct research approach when it had stated that tarantism was an institution: but at the same time, it claimed that tarantism was an illness, and specifically a psychic disorder. What might have been the relationship between an institution and an illness remained an obscure point, destined to remain so for a long time, and in any case neither the Enlightenment education nor the prevalently medical perspective of Serao, his masters and his disciples was in any condition to clarify it. Moreover, the thesis that spiders had nothing at all to do with the question remained, as we have said, unproved. Serao had said that in the question of tarantism, animals and diseases entered in obliquio and the Apulians in recto, but he did not say — and he could not say it due to lack of data — how things really stood. His was a working hypothesis, but it had to be tested in the field. It happened, though, that when the question of tarantism was taken back up around 1830, in the new positivistic climate that was developing and the progressive specialization of medical science, precisely that broader perspective on tarantism as a cultural institution necessarily fell by the wayside— the perspective which had blossomed in the Lezioni of the physician, humanist, and philosopher Francesco Serao.

If we follow the medical literature on tarantism throughout the nineteenth century and subsequently — from De Renzi to Vergari, from Carusi to Panceri, from De Masi to De Raho — the evaluation became more and more professional and specialized, the reduction of the phenomenon to a disease became increasingly exclusive, and the cultural aspects of the phenomenon, with the decline of the figure of the physician-humanist, are by then left aside as superfluous from the chosen perspective, or at most mentioned in some superficial and imprecise annotation. The two fundamental medical solutions — that is, tarantism as a form of arachnidism or a psychic disorder — continued to battle each other, with the second solution prevailing, but without either of the two managing to definitively subdue the other with decisive observations and experiments. In short, the entire controversy gradually lost vigor and risked dragging on without a solution until the day when the phenomenon had disappeared and the ven, subject of the dispute had been lost.

The truth was that the medical perspective revealed its interpretive limit with regard to tarantism: the doctors, in fact, were induced to look for the characteristic of the phenomenon in the unity of a certain disease, when instead it was sought in the autonomy of a culturally conditioned mythical-ritual paradigm. In the meantime, outside of the strictly medical literature, the means of evaluating tarantism throughout the entire nineteenth century continued to reflect — as it already had in the period of natural maternal the birth of the new science — the mindsets and moods of its cheerers and critics. This once happened in an extremely frank way, when a certain Ginse, Chiaia, an Apulian native of Rutigliano, a man of the Risorgimento brigade with anticlerical feelings, treated the subject in a piece that was somewhat between serious and facetious, punctuated by malicious allusions; in it, however, tarantism simply became a pretext to express his easily identifiable literary passions, inclinations, and humors with sprightliness. The documentary data were purposefully and openly not respected by Chiaia, but liberally arranged in such a way as to serve some of his precise polemical intentions. Epifanio Ferdinando gave a brief report of the episode of the Bishop of Polignano, Milanese Giovan Battista Quinzato, and aside from that rapid mention of a few lines, nothing else was known of it. But here is how the episode is transformed in the fantasy of the malicious, anticlerical writer:

The seventeenth-century writer Epifanio Ferdinando, the most ardent keeper of the tarantula, narrates in his stories to have personally met a reverend Dominican monk. Giovan Batti: Quinzato, Milanese, Bishop of our Polignano. The latter was from a sub-Alpine province and immune to these mysterious diseases, but once he was down among us, he no longer felt at ease in the midst of a hubbub of Milanese. He came to the conclusion that in the long run, sooner or later, he would have to become involved in the affair of the frene and licentious dances and provocative music, since inside a species of arachnid, a greatel beast - Satan! - had insinuated itself. Having emptied his sac of Prayers and exorcisms, exhausted his vein of homilies and pastorals, one fine July day he thought to attempt a conclusive, solemn, episcopal trial, good for cutting this Apulian vice short and putting an end to it. He called a country-dweller, had a basket of eight-legged spiders brought, mulberry-colored and articulated, hairless on one side and hairy on the other, of those reputed to be wickedest. Certain of his safety, in the presence of his capitulars and the town notables, he had his barber place them on him as if it were a great bloodletting, on his back, on his arms, on his chest, everywhere.

The onlookers were astounded, and he held forth with the forbearance of a martyr, the likes of which are no longer seen today; he, calm and smiling like Daniel in the den! But as our common people say, the angel passed and said amen: after a few moments a red blotch with a dark edge appeared, I believe, under a roll of flesh, with an excruciating burning. Monsignor, quite upset, asked for liniments and laid down in bed. The curia was thrown into confusion, doctors were called in for consultation, but there was no balm, no bandage, or antidote that could do the job. Then spasms wracked him, and for the rest of the day and the following night, rather than diminish, the pains became more atrocious. He suddenly started choking, passing out, raging, and tearing the sheet to shreds. Alas! The Reverend gave in to the spider, tarantolato like the simplest boor in Apulia, wholly in spite of his Ambrosian austerity. Sneering and murmuring in the workshops and in the squares, the imps, the old tarantolate, the girls more or less aspiring to some future tarantism of their own, the peasant rabble and the loafers, shouted out every so often: if he doesn't dance, he'll die! Was it in celebration or in wrath? I do not know, but the citizenry was permanently assembled as if it were the eve of a revolt. And there was no way around it: Monsignor was at death's door, when as dawn broke on the third day, motu proprio, having gathered what little vital force he had left, he rose from his bed in nightshirt and knickers and said: "play for me!" Here an altar-boy with a pipe, there a conventual monk from San Vito a Mare with a mandola, having formed a very plain band, found sympathetic agreement. The curtains were lowered on the balconies, and then the Bishop stood erect as a pine tree, twirling on his toes, toe and heel, leaping like a young fawn, up and down the length of the great hall of the Bishopric, arms stuck straight up and fingers snapping. The more the instruments were blown and plucked, the faster the harmonic notes followed, the more he pirouetted, crisscrossing his pair of hocks in mid-air... two piperno-stone columns of the Cathedral! A summertime sweat of a truly equatorial sort: he was dripping like someone who had come out from the sea onto the shore, puffing like a young whale. 

If Don Albertario and Don Margotti had seen him, rest their souls! The witnesses of the bloodletting were also witnesses of the round-dance at the sound of the piper, so the miracle took place in front of eyewitnesses: immediately after the sweat, the Reverend came to. From that unfortunate day on, he held this Apulian vice in the highest consideration. When he came across those wounded by the eight-legged creature, he repeated several of the psalmist's hemistiches fused into one and said, smiling: oves pasquae meae, senes cum junioribus, psallite in tympano et citara, psallite in cymbalis benesonantibus!* Does one think that | am exaggerating? Here, then, is what Ferdinando writes: testor Deum, nisi musica, aliisque antidotis ei satisfactum fuisset, jam vitam cum morte commutasset.*'* Here the episode of the Bishop of Polignano clearly serves as a pretext for sketching the tale of the austere Milanese bishop compelled to dance “like the simplest boor in Apulia,” and humiliate his haughty sureness as a reformer coming from the North in the face of the “Apulian vice.” With this, Chiaia carries out in his own way the literary vendetta of a liberal against the Church and of an Apulian against the Northern “conquerors” of the Mezzogiorno. With the same deliberately polemical intent, Chiaia refashions Kircher’s note on a certain Capuchin friar who, just like the Bishop of Polignano, had mocked tarantism and then remained its miserable victim: Attanasio Kircher, of the Company of Jesus, famous for his immense erudition, tells of a Capuchin friar, seven cubits tall and with two wrists which could dwarf those of the colossal of Barletta. This friar, seeking alms in our countryside, would mock all of the tarantolate he encountered with an affected air, and in roguish slang would say to them: “That’s some spider! But crossing the length and breadth of the countryside, visiting threshing-floors and feasts, he would end up with a leafy tree; in the end, someone who has bare feet discovers his heel’s vulnerability. So, there you have the friar complaining about a burning on his ankle, due to restlessness: he confessed that at night he dreamed of the shapely calli by a re yas ae ji oe no longer had any beneficial effect. In a burst of anger, he choked, like a forge’s bellows, his eyes flaring like a furious bull. He yelled, and the superior of the Capuchin friars, in a cell, would say through the keyhole: “Father guard, I understand Pam be eh tarantula has tricked me!” And for three years, with an old shepherd and a rustic reed flute, he galloped in the midst of the colossal heat.

In the same light and amiable tone, Chiaia also debates the various interpretations of tarantism, leaving the discussion to a doctor “in Bourbonism,” in the odor of one who in the literary fiction gets introduced to favor “a nervous exaltation produced by a Pugliese vice with an appeal to new, decisive experiences, otherwise all of us, both educated and uneducated, will remain in the dark for many other centuries.” The truth was that the medical perspective had led the interpretation of tarantism to a dead end, which could much in the direction of new observations and cautious experiments, as in the direction of verifying the perspective adopted itself, that is, that of the reduction of tarantism to a disease. The medical oct from the 1600s until the period in which Baron Francesco De Raho WTO helmonograph ~ which bears the resounding positivistic title I/rarantolismo nel superstizione e nella scienza [Tarantism in Superstition and Science] — had the great merit of putting popular belief into question, interrupting that idolatrous participation in tarantism in themes of natural magic which had had cunretil joe. Le oy of Father Kircher. But now this began to show its interpretive : i ap € experiments and observations risked becoming inconclusive. Recently, Sigerist and Katner recognized a historical-cultural aspect of the phenomenon alongside the medical aspect. But what was really seated was a radical change in perspective, the explicit assumption of fe reeminence — of the historical-cultural evaluation and the subsidiary werden, df the other sciences of man ~ this within a neo-historicist and neo-humanist framework no longer lacking in means, open to interdisciplinary collaborations imposed by the research object itself.

Back in the 1600s, Giorgio Baglivi had inaugurated the * The famous statue of Venus Callipige. + Giacomo Favretto (1849-1887), depicting customs and traditions, A play on the expression “in the odor of sanctity.” Italian painter known for his prolific production of works py chance the totality, ‘he tarantism as a culturally conditioned institution, consequently orienting the TOWARDS A HISTORICIST PERSPECTIVE 243 medical perspective by choosing the hypothesis of a true tarantism as disease, ificing the “rest” in false tarantism of the little carnivals of women and ‘ous popular beliefs and superstitions. But once a dead end was reached in s research perspective, it became legitimate for us to ask if the rest was not and our choice of hypothesis to test should not actually th avestigation and necessary collaborations in this direction. This need was even more justified in that there was a risk that the inconclusiveness — or, we may say, e crisis — of the traditional medical perspective would indirectly help make ntism combine with irrationalistic themes of contemporary culture, and rticular with the various forms of neo-Kircherism which are nowadays so illing to celebrate the occult correspondences of the universe and the ineffable mystery of symbols. Nor was this risk merely hypothetical, because in fact in {948 the musicologist Marius Schneider had proposed an interpretation of jarantism that represented in a certain sense the modernized continuation of the Kircherian tradition. Schneider — who, it must be said as an aside, never had the chance to observe tarantism “in the field” — placed the phenomenon in question within the typological framework of the so-called “medicinal rites,” ich involve three distinct phases: the first, connected with transitory death and infirmity, from October to January; the second, centered on the struggle between forces of good and evil, from February to June-July; the third, linked to the convalescence and prosperity, from June-July to August. In relation to the three phases of the medicinal rite, the instruments would vary, as would the type of melody and intonation of the voice, in such a way that at the first phase belong the pandero,* the seashell, the funerary dance and the vibrating voice; to the second, instruments like the vihuela,' the zampogna,™ the drum; 3 Throughout his works, De Martino repeatedly returned to the problem of irrationalism, both in terms of scholarship and social trends in our society. The point arises most forcefully in his discussions of the experience of the sacred and spirituality, especially the phenomenological approaches with which he had a fruitful, if critical, engagement. From the phenomenologists whose work inspired De Martino (Rudolf Otto, Mircea Eliade and Jung, among others), the notion of the symbol offered “a means for countering the naturalistic reductions of mainstream ethnology” (Fabio Dei: personal communication). On the other hand, De Martino critiqued the phenomenological stance on sacred experience, arguing that the sacred was not a radically diverse reality or an “irreducible irrational nucleus” resistant to rational understanding (Furore, Simbolo, Valore: 86), but that the experience of the sacred had a profound rationality as “a cultural fact” with its own “human genesis” (ibid.: 109; Sroria e metastoria: 53). Our task, then, is to analyze the sacred rationally, and not to theorize its irrationality nor immerse ourselves in the religious experience in the hope of empathetically understanding it. De Martino made this point by quipping that the researcher must be subject to the same prohibition as concert-goers in Germany, where a sign in the concert halls warns: “Mitsingen ist verboten” (Storia e metastoria: 77). As for wider social trends, we might consider the various beliefs and practices which nowadays come under the heading of “New Age”: in this regard, De Martino was critical of what he termed a “cultural relativism without perspective,” and he was concerned about the “risk of abdicating the relos of Western civilization” (Furore, Simbolo, Valore: 145, 152).

In a period in which everything risks being ut into question and in which the limits of our civilization are themselves at e, this experience was greatly facilitated by the sensation of a “border” or st Thule which the Salento impresses on the visitor’s soul with its memories: js the farthest tip of Italy, extending to the ruggedness of the Cape of Santa Maria di Leuca, towards the Sanctuary where the Crusaders gathered in prayer where the throngs took shelter upon the Saracens’ landing. For nearly nine nturies, a sea-borne nightmare weighed on people’s souls, and it left a trace in the “mutate di cielo” [changes in the sky] - that is, a recurrent mirage in which she coastal inhabitants between Otranto and Mount Gargano saw the approach of the Turkish fleet mirrored in the clouds. But the feeling of a border and a limit crops back up in another sense, too, with the approach each summer of the feast of Saints Peter and Paul, when an obscure temptation of disorder ‘and chaos winds through the peninsula, and people resort to a mythical-ritual order that belongs to a world which is culturally extraneous to Christian order and resistant to it.'® This is how the present study came to be: the history of a culturally conditioned symbol operating in a circumscribed geographic area and in particular chronological terms — the history of tarantism from the Middle Ages to the 1700s and beyond.

Tarantism was first of all observed in a provisional ethnographic abstraction, and in this phase of the study we tested the chosen hermeneutic perspective of tarantism as an “institution” rather than a “disease.” Through the fieldwork, we were able to establish that there is a casual connection with particular forms of arachnidism — especially latrodectism — and that tarantism is irreducible to a psychic disorder. At the same time, there was evidence that the phenomenon featured a well-defined, culturally conditioned symbolic autonomy, a mythical-ritual horizon of recovery and reintegration for critical moments of existence, with a marked preference for the crisis of puberty, the theme of frustrated eros, and the conflicts of adolescent girls — all within the scope of a peasant regime of existence.

After this first test of the chosen historical-cultural and historical-religious perspective, complementary material and further checks were introduced in order to remove the phenomenon from the isolation of ethnographic observation. The first set of complementary material led in a historical direction, through the documentary traces of various writings on the subject from the Middle Ages to Schneider's research. On the contrary, a sort of mythopoetic race with historical productivity and integrating it with a sense from the unquestionable depths of hi comprehension is that of discovering apparently irrational behaviors of i true irrati i - ae es apparently irrational behaviors which characterize tarantism, remaining an irrationality in the immediate way, certainly not rendered more comprehensible by a hypothetical widening of the mystical landscape to which it belongs.

On this path, in exchange, we obtain a return to the mindset which predominated in the period, further justified by this last incident in the vicissitude of the journey with the hegemonic forms of cultural life in the West. In the unconscious, are not at it seems that the author one rical tarantism, continuing its oval trajectory, is related to the soul. The task of historiography is to reconstruct the culturally conditioned coherences in the individuals and groups: this is especially true for the so-called “choreutic” phenomena, which, despite being likely forms of other critical episodes, did not reach the stimulus of the choreutic epidemics in Northern Europe. They were, however, comparable to the tarantism phenomenon, spread through the feast-days of Saints Peter and Paul, mostly in the Mediterranean culture, where it was incorporated into various rituals and practices.

He is much an heir to Enlightenment thinkers and historicism, though he diverges from the posi turn in post-Enlightenment thought and holds to historicism and idealism (his main infl in this regard being Hegel and Croce, tempered with Marx and Gramsci). It should be too, that De Martino emphatically attacked irrationalism precisely because his interes magic and religious experience raised suspicions of his own irrationalism among ortho ‘ Crocians, on the one hand, and members of the Italian Communist Party (PCI), on the ol hand (Cesare Cases, “Introduction” to the 1973 edition of De Martino’s /] Mondo Ma op. cit., p. XXXVI; Carla Pasquinelli [1997], “Solitudine e inattualita di Ernesto De Marti Ernesto De Martino nella Cultura Europea, op cit., Pp. 291). Moreover, we should also note what Marcello Massenzio has termed De Martino’s “widened” historicism, applied to n® problems of modern civilization (Storia e metastoria: 28; we see this application most clea some of the essays in Furore, Simbolo, Valore and in the posthumous volume La fine del mon@ [De Martino 1977]). o * This warning is echoed in a commentary by De Martino to Jung’s article “Archaic Man Magia e civilta (1962).

On Iberian tarantism, Laguna, in his commentary to Dioscuride (1570, Materia medicinal, Salamanca, book II, ch. 56) mentions tarantism as a phenomenon which is widespread in Apulia and in the Kingdom of Naples, without making explicit references to Spain. If we leave Laguna aside, we find the first account in Tesoro de la Lengua castellana by Sebastian Covarrubias (1611), where at the entries for tarantela and atarantado, we read that the bite of the tarantela — that is, of the little saranta — is treated "al son de instrumentos, parquet el Paciente, moviéndose al compas del son, disimula su mal" [with the sound of instruments, so that the patient, moving to the tempo of the music, conceals his pain], and that the atarantado is he who, having been bitten by the sarantela, enters into a state of agitation which is cured with music and dance.

On the earliest Iberian tarantism, see F. Xavier Cid (1787), Tarantismo observado en Espana, Madrid, which was followed throughout the nineteenth century by a number of strictly medical monographs. More recently, Marius Schneider in La danza de espadas y la tarantela (1948, Barcelona), relates some examples which date from the end of the nineteenth century and the first decades of the present one. Among these, there is a case observed in Aragona in July 1944, in which a tarantato attended, without Participating in the dance, choreutic performances of a corps of dancers who "matan la arana" [kill the spider] by dancing and singing (Schneider, op. cit., pp. II ff. and 23).

In Spain as in Apulia, the gradual opening of tarantato to the rhythm of the dance took place (F. Xavier Cid, op. cit., case XXIV), and we find the tradition of the taranta who is sensitive to music, compelled to dance with the dancers until her death (Schneider, op. cit., p. 21). In Spain, too, as in Apulia, the interruption of the music, its poor performance or the use of an inappropriate melody meant the accentuation of the crisis in the tarantato (Schneider, op. cit., p. 14). In general, the documentation on Iberian and Sardinian tarantism which can be found in the sources cited is not even remotely comparable to what we______ The following text has been corrected and cleaned up:

What he does requires extreme sensitivity, a continual effort of adjustment. And he must 'discover' himself even as he studies the results of his research. As in his scientific work, he can succeed in such an attempt only if he pursues it in all its ramifications, and somehow reveals what goes On behind the scenes" (Georges Balandier [1966] Ambiguous Africa: Cultures in Collision, trans Helen Weaver.

In citing this passage by Balandier, Giorgio Gusdorf recently highlighted this recurrent theme of the modern ethnographic journey: "Many of the recent ethnological works are in effect written in the first person: aside from Afrique ambigué by Balandier, We have had Afrique fantéme by Michel Leiris and Tristes Tropiques by Claude Lévi-Strauss} one might also include the quite remarkable Do Kamo by Maurice Leenhardt, and Griaule's Dieu d'Eau, which bear the same inspiration.

On the contrary, this attitude opens up a new dimension in the research of faithfulness to the real, as has already______ This historical-cultural perspective bears a humanistic principle of the entirely human origin and destiny of all cultural heritage, which must be proved and reconfirmed continuously: without this hegemony of historical science and the historicist choice, all of the human sciences of 160.

7i The sense of the extreme character of this land is evident in the novel Finibusterre by Luigi Corvaglia (1936, Florence), written "in times in which it was necessary to be in the pack with someone, against someone," that is in the period of Fascist dictatorship. The novel, which, among other things, gives ample space to tarantism in its plot, reflects precisely the rebel spirit which, in the emptiness carved into souls by oppression, turns to its own land and its own memories, in the desperate attempt to reach the threatened toots of human living: "sense of existence, hunger, thirst, mine, yours, always, death... that is, life taken to the limits that make it tragic."

Appendix 1
Jeuropsychiatric Considerations on Tarantism
Giovanni Jervis
Psychiatry is not new to the problem of measuring its own clinical and psychopathological approaches with the study of the physical and cultural environment in which mental disturbances evolve and are treated. However, it is important to note that although the studies conducted on this theme have a long-standing tradition — and in particular on the role of socio-cultural variables in the genesis and characterization of mental derangement and behavioral alteration — they have never been developed in a truly systematic and unitary fashion, but have remained divided into a number of branches, for the most part independent.

For example, one may recall the studies of mental illness in colonial countries, the vast field of mental health and preventative psychiatry, the statistical and sociological research on mental illness, the study of environment and upbringing as factors in relation to psychiatry, and also all of the fundamental contributions made by disciplines like social psychology, cultural anthropology, ethnology, and us sciences, each of which has moved according to its own methods to discuss questions that were also of undoubted interest to psychiatry.

Today, someone who wishes to take up this topic will often encounter declarations that the modern study of psychiatry has more and more rapidly become social, moving closer to the study of environment and situations, but at the same time he will realize how confused and uncertain this vast subject remains from a methodological point of view; it features the contributions of specialists from quite distant cultural backgrounds, who often do not collaborate. Aside from the lack of a real interdisciplinary collaboration and the ever-present danger for psychiatry of altering into fields which are not its own, perhaps the main difficulty lies in the contrast which exists between the clinical tradition and those of psychology and sociology: the former is tied to taxonomic study of lesions and dysfunctions, while the latter are less empirical and at times more attentive to methodological factors, but avoid treating abnormalities and illnesses as disorders and processes in large part autonomous and bearing their own laws. The notion of the relativity of the norm concept was introduced mainly through the work of ‘Ruth Benedict,' based on the discovery of primitive cultures firmly established on behaviors that in the Western world or in other civilizations are classified as typically pathological. “In a certain sense,” writes Alexander, “mental illness is defined by the culture in which the person lives, whether or not the reactions of the individual are recognized as abnormal deviations from the members of the group on the basis of their standards of behavior, and often also whether or not the reactions are recognized as abnormal by the individual himself.”

In this relativistic perspective, the man considered schizophrenic by a people and by a period is elsewhere hailed a wise man or a prophet, and even today, a given behavior can be classified according to a society’s judgment as delirium and hallucination rather than inspiration or vision.

On the other hand, as Mayer-Gross* aptly warns us, this sort of relativism with its apparent 800d sense runs the risk of undermining the biological bases of psychiatry, making us forget that, probably, the hallucinations of the schizophrenic are due to an objectively existing morbid process, even if it is not always recognized as such. The fact that among certain populations, symptoms considered to be typical of schizophrenia are successfully reproduced for ritual ends does not alter the problem, which is one of method: for psychiatry, the definition and the study of what is illness remains based on biology and medicine.

Very often, however, the question remains open, inasmuch as we are faced with abnormal behaviors which do not seem determined by true morbid processes — that is, illnesses — but appear instead largely conditioned by environmental stimuli and necessities. We should note that such a distinction, corresponding to the one between psychosis (mental illness in a proper sense) is not always clear nor incontrovertible. Nonetheless, it maintains an indicative value as part of Jaspers' contribution; moreover, Carstairs has recently insisted with renewed emphasis on the distinction between psychoses like schizophrenia and melancholy, which have a greater or lesser frequency in all civilizations and social groups, and neuroses, for which a real transcultural resemblance does not exist.

Thus, it is with regard to behavioral disturbances with a more clearly dynamic origin that the importance of studying the environment is more evident. Freud's contribution, whose importance in the definition of relations between individual and society, is undoubtedly rendered an enormous service to psychology, in that it broke up the old sociological system, which was closed in a static structure of individual and social facts, from which the individual and his psychological problems could not be separated.

On the other hand, the Freudian idea of a social structure determined by psychological mechanisms (oral, anal, genital and aggressive impulses, in Oedipal complex) was seriously criticized not only for methodological reasons, but also on the basis of ethnographic studies, among primitive communities. As we know, the famous works of B.R. Benedict and M. Mead, with the discovery of kinship and group ete ee certain fundamental motivations, such as the filial tie, the Oedipus compl ee - Fei could be lacking and substituted by dynamics which were prevaail a " Ee or in tac way, on the one hand, to deepening the study of how behavioral within a certain social formation, and on the o' iti s i t i ther hand, to cri Stine of dynamic psychiatry as elaborated in the Western world," In the ems a eat of certain currents of thought and the progress of experimental psychology in 1 0 create, especially in the United States, a bra: i i a the ——_- experience, rich in new results. s ae % rE eco “mig et ee — Freudian investigation of the need to study history and 's of life as well as the true basis for standard: i i ‘ in fe: ards of human behavior; '" in Es ee : Fromm decisively reaffirmed the need to consider man asa social being, defnatil to = a group, a class, and not as an abstract individual obliged only secondarily pi ae ‘ions with others to satisfy his instinctive necessities, Although he criticized the ns na and autonomous human nature, ina way Fromm nonetheless upheld the latter # bin ‘ its on fired and dynamics, while the development and critical examination of Pap are aes ity allowed numerous other authors to criticize with greater decisiveness ee nt “ ween (individual) Personality and (group) culture."

For Horney, the neurotic is a person who has been exposed in a particular way to ironmental difficulties, and who has interiorized the contradictions of his culture, mainly ain envil through childhood experiences, without later managing to resolve them.'* In her conclusion to clinical documents collected in the United States, Horney describes the negative consequences of exacerbated individual competition which is “not only assertive but aggressive” within human groups and families themselves, and the contradiction created within individuals between this inciple and the Christian norm of fraternal love. She thus locates the underlying cause of the solitude and insecurity which ground neuroses in the mechanism of a civilization which subjects man to continuous inducements, to which he cannot respond in a coherent way. As examples of his profound difficulties, not always consciously recognized, Horney cites the contradiction between the continuous commercial stimulus for consuming certain products and the frustration of the majority of individuals, for whom the satisfaction of their needs is strictly limited, and, moreover, the incompatibility between the individual's alleged freedom and independence "in the great game of life" and the actual reality in which "[w]hat has been said facetiously of the impossibility of choosing one's parents can well be extended to life in general — choosing and succeeding in an occupation, choosing ways of recreation, choosing a mate. The result for the individual is a wavering feeling of boundless power in determining his own fate and a feeling of entire helplessness. These contradictions embedded in our culture are precisely the conflicts which the neurotic struggles to reconcile,..."

Neurosis, then, is the consequence of the set-back which some individuals suffer in their attempt to respond adequately to the requests and taboos of social orders which concede individuals the illusory freedom of individual rights, but not the more substantial freedom of a different future.'* This method of interpreting neurosis has been rendered difficult enough in our civilization by the impossibility of objectively judging a social mechanism whose contradictions affect the psychiatrist himself, but it is still more arduous when we consider cultures which are quite different from those of the Central European and American bourgeoisie, in which the Western theory of neurosis has had its most interesting developments.

On the whole, it is fair to recognize that the revision of Freudian doctrine has placed a limitation on one sector of psychiatry: that of the necessity of utilizing studies in the fields of economics, cultural anthropology and social psychology in order to establish the standards of normality and individual motivations, and thus to be able to thoroughly study and treat certain cases of conflict-based illness.

"We note that the problem does not solely concern "exotic" societies based on "different" norms: A.B. Hollingshead and F.C. Redlich" have shown that differences in values and language among social classes are of great importance for the study of mental illnesses, and Carstairs of London has observed that "both diagnoses and psychotherapy can be seriously compromised by the barriers of communication existing between a middle-class psychiatrist and a working-class patient." Psychiatric practice itself, then, can be faced with a serious obstacle, and at a certain point the psychiatrist is forced to suspend judgment of an individual's motivations if he is not well enough acquainted with the latter's socio-cultural background.

With regard to these approaches, there is a danger which must be kept in mind. This danger arises in the tendency to face certain problems of social structure by relativizing and subjectivizing them within individuals, in order to then attempt to resolve them in a psychological vein with help from modern group techniques or clinical psychology. Clearly, the psychiatric problems considered up to this point maintain their legitimacy notwithstanding an error of this sort. Various forms of society devise means of defense against the manifestation of abnormal behaviors, but this fact constitutes a particular problem. 

These means lie within our field of investigation, in that they are indivisible from the conditionings which provoke the emergence of neurotic conflicts, but they also escape the bounds of psychiatry and touch other disciplines, especially inasmuch as they concern the study of magical-religious motivations. In dealing with present-day tarantism in the Salentine region in a team study and from a neuropsychiatric point of view, it is first of all necessary to exclude the possibility that behind its manifestations lies a real toxic syndrome from a spider bite. The Latrodectus tredecim guttatus (Rossi), the only arachnid in Italy which is truly dangerous for man, is more common than believed. 262 THE LAND OF REMORSE Because of its habits, it is difficult to observe and it may happen that its bite — very rare co, with the frequency of the animal — passes momentarily unnoticed or feels like a simple bit important local consequences, Fairly often, indeed, the sy! | other causes,"! The Poison acts primarily on the nervous system. The symptoms may be summarized as toxic state with mental confusion and a complex set of neurological disturbances,2? Sho: the bite, paroxysmal pains appear which tend to be localized on the torso and the lower Ij and they become more acute until reaching an unbearable intensity; these pains are ac aa ( by an increasingly serious compromise of the general condition: the subject can hard} i breathes shallowly and with difficulty, displays a set of characteristic symptoms, among wa ae abundant perspiration, a diffuse muscular rigidity with spasms, an irregular tremor pre a be the lower limbs (sometimes taking on a convulsive appearance), a marked abdominal pa uel ou face 1s congested and edematous, and the conjunctiva rims are highly reddened, nase ; ee re = and there are often urinary disturbances.

Initially, the patient briefly displays a mood very marked depression, with anguish and a sense of death; then with the full outbreak - ie symptomatology, he becomes confused, agitated, extremely anxious, and sometimes halluci a On the second day, the pains attenuate and the symptoms diminish; at this point, a charactae al sense of burning or tingling on the soles of the feet often appears. As the days pass the sym: ‘om Progressively disappear, but the convalescence can last for weeks. Cases of death are ol no Without prior data on latrodectism in the region, the investigation conducted in the wl of 1959 in the Salento extended in three directions: research in the hospitals, research ame the Peasants in order to discover the existence and notoriety of the animal, iad clinical stu of the tarantati." Contrary to my expectations, research carried out in the various hos ital of Lecce, Galatina, Maglie and Nard6, and with municipal doctors showed me that even led healthcare workers with vast experience among peasants had never seen a case which presented the symptomatology of latrodectism, The study was not extended systematically to the majority of doctors and to all of the hospitals of the Salento, but it was sufficient to justify the assertion that lactrodectism in these places is a very rare disease, and in any case rarer than in other regions of Italy Only in Nardo did I find a vivid memory of a case, to which I will return below is possible that some Cases are treated with the dance, thereby escaping the doctors’ attention. buts would be difficult for these cases to be numerous, due to the gravity and conspicuousness/ah the hoe syndrome, as well as the familiarity many doctors have with the peasants in whose midst Ive. The investigation among peasants showed that the spider exists in the Salento, I showed many people in various zones some Latrodectus and Lycosae brought from Rome in two jars, at the same time learning the popular names of the spiders, In general, however, the answers obtained were not very informative, especially since it seemed that the word “taranta” was used without taking into account the striking morphological distinctions between the different spiders. With regard to the Latrodectus, the response was either, “Never seen it,” or else, “Sure, there are lots of them, even with green and blue spots, or with every color.” I then taught some of the peasants to look for spiders similar to the ones I showed them: after a few days, two of them gave me some — Latrodectus in a Jar, reporting that the first day they only found a couple, but then ae brie vo for them in the right places, and on the third day they easily collected about.

The behavior of the rarantati who gathered in the chapel of Galatina for the annual festival dedicated to St. Paul does not display elements which would suggest the clinical description of latrodectism. We may at most wonder if some of the tarantati of the chapel were, independently of their behavior, under some sort of toxic influence; actually, in none of the cases was it possible to note the presence of organic compromise. Two women said that they still had the mark of the taranta bite on their legs: on one, nothing was seen on the spot indicated, while on the other only a banal venous ectasis was noted.

Among the tarantati I approached, I did not find a single case of latrodectism in progress, not even in the form of symptoms of moderate or light seriousness. The problem is even more difficult with regards to the case histories, since it was not possible to exclude with certainty that the first episode of tarantism — which in some cases had taken place even forty or fifty years earlier — had actually been caused by Latrodectus poisoning. Out of twenty case histories collected, only two or three subjects related elements which could somehow appear compatible with the toxic hypothesis.

One woman (Filomena of Cerfignano) said that she had been bitten by the spider while gathering chick peas, and that she was then struck with violent cramps and precordial heaviness: on the other hand, it seems that she did not sweat at all, and that she did not display any compromise of her general state, so a doctor simply prescribed her some pain-killers. A youth (Cosimo of Nardo) was stung by a “spotted scorpion” and later had violent pains in his head and stomach: a doctor diagnosed sunstroke. Another woman (Caterina of Taviano) was bitten on her wrist by a spider while she pruned grapevines, and she suddenly fell to the ground with no particular symptoms.

The only confirmed case of latrodectism was referred to me by healthcare workers at the hospital in Nardo. This was the case of a man (Pietro of Nardo) who, bitten when he was harvesting, immediately suffered from atrocious pains throughout his body and began to sweat profusely; taken to the hospital, he also displayed a state of psychomotor agitation with clouding of his senses and a marked, painful rigidity of his muscle masses; the doctors noted conjunctive hyperemia. For two days he had urinary retention: treated with suprarenal extracts and sedatives, he rapidly improved and was released after a week. But it is important that even in this sole confirmed case of latrodectism, the initial toxic syndrome was grafted onto the cultural framework of tarantism, complicating itself with a periodic crisis and a culturally conditioned musical-choreutic therapy: in other words, after the toxic syndrome as such had run its course, the tarantism remained. It is legitimate to assume that in other cases, in which the beginning of the crisis of tarantism was by no means caused by a real poisoning from a spider bite, the toxic syndrome of latrodectism had in any case offered a model for the neurosis-based crisis: even if the syndrome of the Latrodectus bite was not directly experienced by the subject, it may have taken on particular meanings and special affective significance in the subject's cultural world, contributing to shape his behavior in certain moments of his life. Moreover, the scarcity of cases of latrodectism in the present-day Salentine Peninsula does not prevent us from supposing that latrodectism may have constituted an important condition in the formation of tarantism as a cultural phenomenon in past centuries, in a period in which the spider may have been more widespread in relation to a very different vegetation and coinciding with annual meteorological factors.

The disorders displayed by the tarantati varied within rather wide limits, from typical symptoms of hepatic colic or purulent otitis media (attributed in two cases to the bite of the taranta) through a wide range of neurotic cenesthopathies, to clearly psychotic situations. A woman with whom I spoke in the chapel displayed the behavior and case history of the most classic depressive psychosis (she accused herself of having accidentally killed a taranta, and for this she went to the chapel, where she attended the performances of the other women); | visited a youth (Giorgio of Galatone) whose behavior raised the suspicion of schizophrenia. It is evident that in considering the various illnesses which the magical-religious ideology includes among the consequences of the spider's bite, medical and neuropsychiatric interest for tarantism remain completely marginal. This is not so, however, if we consider the behavior of the rarantati as such — if a psychiatric point of view studies those peculiar behaviors (and they are nearly the entirety) which do not appear related to a poisoning, a hepatic colic or a depressive psychosis, but which on the contrary appear modeled and conditioned by tarantism as a means of reacting and as an ideology. For the psychiatrist, this necessity of relating the behavior of the tarantati to tarantism arises from a negative motive: the impossibility of resolving present-day tarantism according to the nosological schema of known illnesses.

Once we have dispelled the ambiguity regarding the possible identification of tarantism with latrodectism in present times, it then remains for us to understand why, and with what mechanisms, apparently healthy and normal peasants can manifest behaviors which an outside observer can judge as completely out of the ordinary. The psychiatrist might give a relatively simple answer: tarantism chooses its victims among the suggestible people and hysterics present in every population, and acts in such a way that a person, who is predisposed among other things by his low cultural and intellective level, remains prisoner of certain false beliefs and ends up by releasing the anxieties and conflicts that he could not resolve on the level of real iti and primitive behaviors, now institutionalized. In fact, when we wish to test the validity of this sort of interpretation and when we wish to understand what is hidden behind a too-nebulous term "instinctual and Primitive" mean for psychiatry?), and delve more deeply into the origins and manifestations of tarantism, it becomes necessary to open the sick's case-history, renouncing at least temporarily a rigid clinical approach.

In other cases, the participation was more sporadic, as the lack of a true state of psychomotor involvement was highlighted by the music. There were two cases: a thirteen-year-old girl, Rosaria of Nardo, who calmly walked in a circle to the sound of the tarantella, maintaining perfect control of the environment at every moment, and Maria of Nardo, who appeared to have a tarantata.

There was no observed real hysterical contagion among the men (who were the majority) or outside the group. It cannot be said that there was a real crescendo of the displays. The sense of fatigue and suffering noted in the gestures and individual attitudes of the chapel tarantate was accompanied by the occasional repetition of particular behaviors, such as crawling on the ground, the rhythmic beating of feet, dance steps of Bi, and other behaviors more or less inspired by ritual moments of tarantism. This established a certain difference with respect to the more disorderly and freer displays of certain hysterics observed in other circumstances.

The chapel displays, marked by an atmosphere of disorder and suffering, contrasted with the dances performed in the presence of musicians and subordinated to the ordering drive of ¢ home dances. There were noticeable differences in individual behavior. One protagonist was capable of engaging in an exhausting dance in a profound manner.

The case of Maria lends itself to a "comprehensible" interpretation, as can be intuited from the brief notes that follow. Maria was a twenty-nine-year-old illiterate farmhand, married and without children. Her behavior outside of the crisis was moderate and well-balanced. She lost her father early in life and lived through a miserable and difficult childhood and adolescence without ever displaying abnormal behavior.

At the age of twenty, she fell in love with a youth of slightly superior economic condition, whom she had to renounce. Not long after, she was stung by a "raranta" and then danced. During the first dance, she heard the voice of St. Paul, who told her not to get married. Subsequently engaged with a man she did not love, she was induced to go and live with him in a farmhouse in the countryside, with the aim of being able to marry without a dowry.

After a few days of living with her fiancé, the woman disappeared, turning up at her mother's house three days later, without remembering a thing about the time that had passed. The only thing she remembered was that she had left the house after a fight with her fiancé and had encountered Saints Peter and Paul, who asked her to follow them.

In the year prior to her marriage, she danced nearly every month "because the Saint was unhappy with her behavior." After she married, she danced at regular intervals several times a year, for one to three days each time, preferably in the hot season, and often coinciding with religious festivities or with menstrual periods.

Her husband rebuked her for the dances which cost too much, and "he feared her because she was a tarantata." From an examination of the family context, it was possible to infer the presence of disputes, mostly involving the husband, an invalid from a cavitary tuberculosis.

Observed at length during the home dance, the woman displayed a perpetually immobile and closed facial expression, with her eyes almost always closed. No environmental stimulus (apart from the musical rhythm) generally influenced her behavior. During a pause between one choreutic cycle and another, she displayed no bodily reactions, not even for slightly painful or bothersome stimuli like a fly on her eyelid. 

(It is superfluous to add that the woman never fell to the ground in such a way as to harm herself; moreover, in the intervals between choreutic cycles, she sometimes took water from a glass brought to her mouth.) With the dance prolonging for hours and even days, the hypothesis that the woman could have had hallucinations seems less incongruous. After the end of the dance, she related that despite the fact that she remembered nothing of what had taken place (she appeared torpid, sluggish, and maintained that only a day had passed since the beginning of the dance), the signal for the end had been given to her by St. Paul, who in dialect and with a well-known voice had murmured near her ears: “I’m doing the grace for you.” Moreover, her relatives asserted that she had at times had dialogues with the Saint, in which obviously no one heard the supernatural voice.

The original text reads “who had asked to follow her” (che le avevano chiesto di seguirla), but this contrasts with the version in Chapter 3, which makes more sense. It is likely that a typographical error changed seguirli into seguirla, thus altering the meaning.

266 THE LAND OF REMORSE

As long as — wi - a statistical confirmation, the hypothesis that the tarantati are preferably subjects 'g In Intelligence and culture compared with the Population’s average is of little value; the high number of illiterates among them is not necessarily important, given that the cases studied are few in a region where illiteracy is high. For the same reasons, the data collected up to now are not sufficient to prove the hypothesis that tarantism involves individuals who are predisposed for it through constitutional psychopathologies or nervous illnesses. The conclusion of this commentary can only be one which invites caution. Tarantism is a phenomenon of multiform aspects, not resolvable in exclusively psychiatric terms; its future study will probably be able to be continued only on the basis of an interdisciplinary convergence. The data of psychiatric interest emerging from the twenty-day study in the Salento are relatively numerous but fragmentary: the need to integrate and interpret them in a correct manner is an invitation for further research.

These approaches undoubtedly bear an influence from Marxist thought, but it should not be overestimated. Although it is probable that, especially in the United States, Marxist influences were silenced at a certain point, one has the distinct impression that these approaches were also in part the inevitable consequence of the pure and simple advancement and probing of statistical and experimental studies. It is interesting to note that latrodectism may be the basis of historical tarantism, as suggested by W. Katner's work, "Das Ratsel des Tenia" (The Enigma of the Tenia), which suggests that the poisonings attributed to the 'Lycosa' were not caused by the spider, making it clear that the Lycosa could not in any way cause such poisonings. The most recent annual increase in Italy (relatively moderate) was in 1947. For additional details, see S. Bettini, op. cit.

Some scholars emphasize the psychological aspects of tarantism, such as F. De Raho's "Tarantolismo nella superstizione e nella scienza" (Tarantism in Superstition and Science) and E. Giordano's "Una particolare forma di psicosi collettiva: il tarantismo" (A Particular Form of Collective Psychosis: Tarantism).

M.A. Arch. of General Appendix 2 Problems of Psychology in the Study of Tarantism Letizia Jervis-Comba With his study of thirty-six Rorschach protocols collected among the Alorese, Oberholzer clearly established a form of collaboration between the psychologist and the ethnologist.' Cora du Bois, following her stay in Alor, described the salient characteristics of the culture and personality of this pulation, basing her analysis on the free conversations and observations she made throughout her fieldwork. She then gave Rorschach’s great disciple the test protocols of a group of Alorese and asked him to draw up his own description of the typical personality of the group. By comparing these responses with the ones of the average Swiss which were so familiar to him, the psychologist reached conclusions regarding the character of the Alorese which were extraordinarily similar to those of the anthropologist. This incorporation of more specialized psychological techniques in an anthropological study came on the heels of attempts by Bleuler,? Henry and other scholars,‘ designed to investigate the possibility of using the Rorschach and other projective tests in the study of different cultures: within the milieu created by Kardiner’s studies and his conception of base personality, this appeared extremely productive and was destined to be followed up in subsequent years in the work of other imminent cultural anthropologists and psychologists.’ The danger in this approach is revealed, on the one hand, by a methodological examination, and on the other hand, by the type of interdisciplinary collaboration created in these studies: the comparison of traits of a population in which the test was originally conceived and studied with those of a culturally diverse population is not justified, because we do not know what norms it is based on.® Moreover, the convergence of conclusions that has somehow been reached between psychologists and anthropologists in their research with this method has induced in the champions of these two sciences even greater certainty and faith in their own methods’ without leading them to a more attentive examination of the reasons for the divergences — which in any case are always present — or of the possibility that they supplement the material collected on both sides, rather than limiting themselves to seeking teciprocal confirmation. The Cora du Bois-Oberholzer method is one of the ways to utilize the Rorschach test in studying primitive cultural settings. Hallowell earlier examined the problem and later continued to explore it. His most interesting methodological aspect concerns the possibility of studying a population's acculturation through projective techniques, particularly Rorschach. The analysis focuses on different stages of the same culture, where initially equal groups developed differently due to environmental conditions.

However, the Rorschach test itself was born in a particular cultural milieu, and we don't know if its theory can allow unconditional use in any type of setting or culture. A study by the Australian psychologist Cook in Samoa aimed at clarifying this problem, reaching a negative conclusion. Jules Henry and Melford Spiro stated that anthropologists turned to psychology in a "search for instruments which might reduce the impressionistic element" of their studies.

The psychologist preparing to use a test must be cautious not to reduce the accurate interpretation of a projective test to a brilliant exposition of personal impressions. The inventor of the test has the advantage of knowing his subjects, but the disadvantage of not being able to compare his experimental verification method with other methods used for the test.

In the initial phase of the encounter between the psychologist and the as-yet unknown population, collaboration with scholars of other disciplines is precious and indispensable. The collection of raw data is delicate and complex, with each scholar contributing to the task by bringing personal impressions acquired through diligence with particular problems. 

A point of the study, qualitative evaluation follows by rigorous examinations, leading to the production of a new instrument. Dialog with research group members will undergo a hiatus, then resume when the instrument is ready. Data from the latter will be supplemented in a broader perspective. It is necessary to adapt instruments to the circumstances or create new ones.

In the collaboration with other disciplines, Psychology offers culturally conditioned instruments and the Scientific method for correctly producing and utilizing them.

Projective tests and associated measures of intelligence were used to clarify the diagnostic problem of tarantism. The psychologist's task had a dual aspect: collaborating with the Psychiatrist and furnishing a background for the heterogeneous group.

Twenty days were not enough for an in-depth study, but a contribution could be made to clarifying the value or limits to the use of personality tests in the South. Bringing various Personality tests to the field allowed for choices and enriching theoretical considerations.

Please note that the text above is a cleaned-up version of the original text provided. It is not an exact translation or transcription, but rather a rephrased version to convey the original meaning. For an evaluation of the subjects’ intellectual level, we discarded those personality tests which were too bound to “paper and pencil.” Nonetheless, we hoped that some result could be obtained with the Revised Beta Examination" (despite its clear unsuitability in some parts: for example, the vignette about the field of snow). Kohs blocks seemed promising, though probably not appropriate for stimulating adequate motivation in an illiterate adult. Some indication was hoped to be gained with the Bender Motor Visual Gestalt Test, the Wartegg Picture Completion Test and the Rosenzweig Picture Frustration Test.'* Additionally, we decided to use, whenever possible, human figure drawing and free drawing. Naturally, the Rorschach and the T.A.T. were chosen among projective tests.'® A list of “stimulus words,” drawn in part from Rapaport’s list and in part chosen by us from among those which would have been relevant for the problem being studied, would allow us to gather the most common associations in the group, with the aim, too, of clarifying basic cultural themes.

Results and Evaluation of the Possibility of Using Personality Tests

Some personality tests were never employed, nor did they appear usable in the field: this happened for the “beta,” due to the more cultured parts of the test and to the lack of the subjects’ ability with paper and pencil, and for the Rosenzweig P. F.T., because it was culturally distant from the Salentine context. It is not possible to evaluate the use of the Bender M.V.G. and the Wartegg P. C., which for other reasons were never employed: in these subjects, “taking a pencil in hand” to do something resembling “homework” often provokes strong defensive reactions — which, however, could have been considered and even studied if time had permitted. But the rapid loss of attention in the subjects, together with the material impossibility of keeping them at home for more than a certain amount of time, led us to choose Kohs blocks or the human figure drawing in every case in which it was possible to administer a test in addition to the Rorschach. Again, due to time limitations, no use was made of the T.A.T.

Besides fifteen Rorschach protocols, which will be discussed separately, seven drawings, five block tests and three word-association lists were collected. The request to draw a human figure was accepted without difficulty in nearly every case, though it is not known whether this was due to the relatively young age (from about 15 to 30 years) of those being asked, or because the relationship between the examiner and the subject had already been well established through a conversation and the Rorschach test. It is difficult to evaluate these drawings as “projective” tests in the same way one would had the population been one with a higher level of education; on the other hand, it is obvious that a precise evaluation of mental age cannot be gathered from them. Considering the characteristics of the group, we suggest that they can be used as a precious guide to the comprehension of the intellectual maturity of each individual, aside from some striking anomalies of bodily representation: in these subjects, in fact, self-criticism is manifested as an initial, generic resistance, and once overcome, the relationship with the examiner (and therefore also, in this case, the attitude toward the task requested) suddenly became quite simple and spontaneous.'* It happened by chance that the Kohs blocks test was administered to precisely the four subjects who were the worst in drawing: the results were still very poor (as well as in the fifth case, for which we have no drawing), despite the fairly good participation and interest shown by the examinees. We do not think that these results, perhaps entirely casual, can rule out the possibility of utilizing Personality tests in future studies, even to clarify which frustrations take place in an illiterate adult who realizes that he cannot manage to do something that seems like child’s play. Indications of perhaps greater interest came from the word associations, due to the type of Associative process as well as the contents of the responses. It must be said first of all that the Subjects understood what was being asked of them only with difficulty. In one case, in the beginning Several stimulus-words were repeated back to me; in another case, [ was answered with some words that were themselves associated, but lacking in any apparent relation to the stimulus-word (father—flower; festa-fruit; or: sad-sun; daughter-moon). However, this behavior stopped shortly thereafter, even if it reappeared briefly during the test. 272 THE LAND OF REMORSE APPENDIX 2 273

The most frequent types of associations are the well-known oppositions (father—mother, and instrumental descriptions (water-drink). These are often alternated with pure and i indications as to the concrete meaning of the stimulus word in the nearest geographic .

Here, too, the test conditions were far from Riso? what are you laughing about barley to : vente) the ideal standard required in every manual. Despite this, the attempt was made to limit variations Bite remorse that makes you cry tobacco ini on all of the most important points, In all cases but one, testing took place in the home of the City Nardo town Nardé tarantato. The arrival or one or two outsiders was noticed right away in the towns, and the welcome Darkness what gets dark light evenin on the part of the tarantati (and especially their families) was not always warm, due in part toa Sad are you sad sun pois generic mistrust but especially to the vivid memory of some unscrupulous pieces of journalism. The Daughter I didn't have one moon joy of the family was almost always possible to reassure everyone in a short time, explaining that we were "doctors" and "cats" mourning faithful 'ta from Rome," and that we wished to understand their illness in order to help them later on. Once the initial barrier had been removed, it was difficult for obstacles, silences, or reticence to resurface. On the contrary, relationships of great cordiality and even of devoted attachment were often established.

We may thus speak generally of a positive attitude and good collaboration on the part of our faithful subjects. Participation was in some cases so lively as to be displayed in a set of intense, worried, and even frightened expressions (Anna of Nard, Immacolata of Taviano, Fernanda of Nardo). Other times, a certain reticence was expressed in self-criticism and in declarations of incompetence (Pietro of Nardé, Giorgio of Galatone). Finally, mention must be made of the case of Peppina of Nardo, who feared that she would "lose her soul" in responding and sought reassurances from her husband and mother-in-law as to the lawfulness of taking the test.

Often, relatives or neighbors attended the examination, and it would have been impossible to make them leave without creating a state of tension or suspicion in the subject or even provoking a refusal. The strangeness and novelty of the procedure, on the contrary, aroused curiosity and interest: everyone wanted to see and comment, but we managed to pose the condition that this would be done only at the end of the test. Only in one case did the setting's conditions seriously influence the subject (a test conducted in the office of the town mayor): the analysis does not use the protocol, which was collected only for contingent reasons.

In cases where the tarantati lived in different towns of the Salentine Peninsula, there was no opportunity for them to exchange information in the interval of time between two of our visits. In cases where this might have been able to occur, we took the precaution of doing everything in one day. It was not always possible to make precise note of the times, in particular of latencies: at any rate, in all of the cases in which it was possible to note them, we have reported the total time of the test, the start time, the presentation time of Card VI (half-way) and the finish time, and "latency" wherever this was obvious even without chronometric verification. Italian was always used, not dialect. The test was sometimes given by the psychologist and sometimes by the psychiatrist: this was done not only for banal practical necessities, such as the presence of one or the other in the most favorable circumstances, but also because the first contacts established with the tarantati suggested which of the two was more appropriate. In particular, for obvious reasons, the (male) Psychiatrist always collected the responses of the men. The instructions were always the same (“now I will show you some cards, tell me what they look like to you, what they resemble”), and we abstained from explanations of how the blots were At this point, it appears that the most interesting aspect of the responses obtained with word associations lies in the indications that can be drawn for a greater understanding of the subject and the economic and cultural horizon in which she lives, The word “house” obtained responses of “that you live in,” but also “and who has one?” and “if I had it!”; “harvest” gets “wheat” 4 L “sickle,” but also “hard work”; and “car” yields “motor” as well as “you going for a ride” an@ * Depending on the context, festa may be translated in several ways, most commonly as “party holiday”, “festival” or “birthday.” ae 5 , Riso can have two very different meanings as “rice” or “laughter.” 274 THE LAND OF REMORSE obtained.

However, it 80 coe a es i in these parameters is determined by the educational level of the Renzi et al. * After ae comme oe on iaaldhenes ere ae z E and careful statistical elaborati i ae that nat only “is the influence of sex and age oi cone vith ee _ i. - also at like no other factor, the level of education influenced the quantity pra aaa sponses,” In their study of the importance of education, they compared the of three hundred normal adult Italians, of whom one hundred with university education, one hund APPENDIX 2 281 red with secondary education and one hundred with elementary education, all selected jn the North. Joining our results with theirs (again, with the caution imposed on us by the limits of our statistics and by the consideration that our subjects were from the South), we must recall that our up seems even less favored by education than their “elementary” group, because almost all of our subjects are illiterate or semi-illiterate, and because their peasant lifestyle, far from the city, ses them less to stimuli brought by posters and newspapers, or by radio and cinema. The data we obtained with the Rorschach test would therefore be located on a descending extension of the jdeal line connecting “university” to “secondary” and “secondary” to “elementary,” and to a large degree this is the case. In particular, we confirm a low number of responses in the subjects with little education, a high number of rejections, a dearth of responses determined by movement or by color (much more evident in our group than in the “elementary” one of De Renzi et al.), a high percentage of perceptions determined by form (here, again, much more evident in our group). Vice versa, we must note that the percentage of appropriately-perceived forms in our group falls to very low levels when compared with more highly educated subjects: this is in agreement with Rizzo’s data, but it is not confirmed by De Renzi et al. These indications are very rough, also because of the lack of a suitable calibration of the test. Despite this, they allow us to confirm the great influence exercised by the subject’s level of education on his responses to the Rorschach cards.

At this point, we might be tempted to make a general theoretical conclusion: that is, we might say that intelligence is obviously improved by instruction, which “expands and increases interior life by activating its affectivity: whence a greater richness of sentiments and a greater sociality in more educated persons.” These inferences are equivalent to recognizing the Rorschach test’s universal validity, inasmuch as they connect the operational definitions of intelligence and affectivity to those originally wanted by the author (except that they contradict him on the “innate” or “acquired” character of these aspects of personality). We argue instead that attention must be given to the complexity of the test situation and to the variables which can most evidently influence it, modifying its essential features.

In her analysis of the studies done with the Rorschach in various cultures, Theodora Abel cites the choice of an adequate motivation as a crucial problem: the subject can be induced to accept the test with the promise of a reward (as Henry did with tobacco and chocolate), or use his respect for the “white” or “educated” person (as Bleuler did), but we must keep in mind that the choice itself is important. Numerous experimental studies have shown that even within a single culture, within a single society, situations exist or may be created which lead to ways of approaching the test that are so different, that they are also reflected in the results. Some situational variables introduced experimentally hold little interest from a pragmatic point of view; others are, on the contrary, quite interesting and unfortunately not yet sufficiently studied. The examiner, the site of the test, the social condition of the subject, and the subjective definition of the test situation have all been the object of study, and even if the analytical conclusions on all of the aspects of the summary indices and ratios touched by the different motivation are not always identical, it is necessary to admit that the convergences are so significant that they persuade us to accept as proven the hypothesis that the test situation has a precise influence on the subject’s performance.

One observation of particular interest for us emerges from Riessman’s study: the framework of responses given to the Rorschach by lower-class subjects greatly resembles that of people who, despite having a more privileged social condition, take the test in conditions of stress. This does not derive from a particular coarctation of the personality inherent in low social standing, since other research methods reveal a rich and differentiated personality in these subjects: rather, it has to do with reactions to a situation which does not have the same meaning for someone who lives in an existential context different from the one in which the test has been studied. The specific way that this diversity of situations gets articulated is still an open question: it has been suggested that it might depend on the fact that the requested task does not appear important or that the unstructured stimulus evokes different behaviors. At any rate, we must conclude that pure and simple instruction and the influence it exercises on personality are not the only factors which differentiate the protocols of groups belonging to different socio-economic levels.

Moreover, any declaration made with the auxiliary of the Rorschach technique on a population which has not been well studied, both in terms of the number of cases and 282 THE LAND OF REMORSE APPENDIX 2 283 —-* oF yaa ty a Les 3s - —— of situational motivations, is today Subjegy 4, For a review of the literature on the subject up to 1948, see T.

The most impressive ta in our view, is the significance of the response contents:* at times they appear directly con a to the subject's traumatic experience (Michele of Nardé, response to Card X); comet al their insistence on macabre, aggressive or violent themes, they reflect serious conflicts with a environment (Maria of Nardo, response to Cards II, V, VII and TX); on other occasions, thro: Ee an excessive emphasis on bodily images linked to sexual references, they suggest the pee o j complex-related attitudes (Carmela of San Pietro: her human figure drawing with visible inte organs also supports the Rorschach content results).

18. For purely indicative purposes, let us say that if the criteria elaborated by Goodenough for children could have been used, our drawings would have given the following mental ages: 4 subjects for four years, 2 for seven years, one unclassifiable. These data appear suggestive precisely for their irregular distribution and for the lack of correlation with schooling. The possibility of placing the profiles of the single cases studied and the group within a wider framework is beyond our capacity and exceeds the limits of a study in which time was the only true obstacle to reaching a better interdisciplinary collaboration. But from the reflection on our limits, we can draw a number of indications for future work. On the one hand, it is necessary to minimize the fickle, uncontrolled aspect in the administration of many personality tests, in connection with not only the most external aspects of psychometric technique (that can and should easily be controlled: place and time of the test, instructions, etc.) but also with the most profound variables which touch the "test situation." On the other hand, a greater amount of information is required, and this may in large part be achieved by increasing the number of guided conversations and interviews that the psychologist and other members of the group (the cultural anthropologist, the social worker, and in a case like our own, the historian of religion) construct together, in the phase of preliminary study and testing and in the subsequent elaborations in the field. Only then will it be possible to obtain, from a method in one's own field and from a lively collaboration with others, a set of indications which will enable each psychologist to assess the value of his instruments and through them, finally, to offer an original and valid contribution to the study of complex cultural phenomena.

Our W% (31) appears extraordinarily high: this is linked to the low number of responses of our subjects, since the average of W per subject remains steady at 4. We do not think it fitting to deal with the average response contents, as with more detailed aspects of the type of location sequencing or determinants (shading, Erlebnistypus, etc.), due to the lack of reliability of our scanty data. For the same reason, we did not calculate the percentage of banal or original responses. If we follow the nine banal answers accepted by Oberholzer (see E. Bohm, op. cit., pp. 120 ff), we obtain an extraordinarily low percentage: 7%. But even to superficial observation it appears that the blue of Card X, which gets seen as “saranta”, might be a banality for this group, while Card V has “bat” or “butterfly” in only one case (this leads us to support the thesis of F. Basaglia and G.

Appendix 3
The Choreutic-Musical Exorcism of Tarantism
Diego Carpitella

In an interdisciplinary study of tarantism with a historical-cultural perspective, the contribution in its phases of therapy and resolution, tarantism, which is seen as a myth, acts as a horizon. In this research, the ethnomusicological contribution is defined by the analysis of tarantism's choreutic-musical patterns and musical therapy, requiring the specific competence of an ethnomusicologist.

"Choreutics" means a protective technique within a magical-religious framework; it allows the crisis to be managed through traditionalized patterns of gesture, sound, figures, and rhythms. This cultural faithfulness to such patterns functions as social ritual, evoking and controlling the crisis.

The Choreutic Patterns of Tarantism

When we speak of the choreutic, we refer solely to the dance, and in the earliest literature on tarantism, there are sparse accounts of the choreutic patterns. We devoted particular attention to non-durable data, and in this way, we identified a bipartite choreutic cycle, one centered on the ritual, up to the moment of the "recovery." This cycle consists of two phases: the first one on the floor, horizontal, mainly oriented toward mimicking the mythical animal (the taranta), and the second one standing, vertical, related to time (the seasonal calendar, the time for the cure or the chapel), chromatics (the symbolic colors) used during the cure.

These patterns, which escaped ethnographic focus, form the "liturgical" tarantella of tarantism, and the well-known tarantella in all probability represents a "profane" derivation. Carpitella is clearly referring here to de Martino's notion of "mythical-ritual dehistorification." Tarantism in fact appears as a choreutic-musical ritual drama with regard to both the ethnographic exploration and the musical exorcism.

The establishment of the bipartite choreutic cycle in the "liturgical" tarantella is based on the following: the observation notes for the two live musical exorcisms witnessed (Maria and Rosaria of Nard); the reconstruction of the tarantella used in the musical exorcism (a reconstruction formed by a female informant at the ethnomusicologist's request); the observation notes for the displays in the chapel of Galatina, where the on-the-floor phase prevailed due to the disarticulation of the ritual order caused by the lack of music, but where from time to time individual attempts to get a rhythm immediately produced some fragments of the standing phase; and finally, the corresponding photographic documents. The following text is from a book:

It must be observed that Salentine tarantism's current conditions of strain and disarticulation have impoverished the liturgical tarantella as compared with its practice in the past. For example, the sword dance has disappeared entirely, and we did not directly observe the rope dance, despite the fact that it was still in existence in De Raho's time (1908), and that we gathered information on it from the case of Carmela of San Pietro Vernotico. Even so, from the material collected, we were able to establish with certainty that the tarantella used in the musical exorcism features the following phases and figures:

On-the-Floor Phase:
Starting from a resting position—supine, legs together or slightly apart, arms relaxed at the hips or in an open oblique position, at the first burst of sound, the tarantata begins to move, undulating and shaking her body, with an inclination and rhythmic rotation of her head and a corresponding rhythmic inclination of her legs in the same and the opposite direction. This is followed by a crawling movement on her back along the ceremonial perimeter, with legs bent in, rhythmically planting her heels and continuing the movement of her head. The crawling on the ground may be interrupted by sudden gyrations of the body planting the head, or by a rapid succession of supinations and pronations (that is, a rolling of the body). The tarantata then passes to the prone position, with her legs slightly apart, arms relaxed along her body or oblique, or bent under her chest or under her face, always maintaining the head's inclination and rhythmic rotation, as in the supine position, and imparting her legs with a rhythmic inclination in the same and in the opposite direction, planting her toes (photos a-c).

Standing Phase:
The tarantata suddenly gets up (photo d), marking the beginning of the standing phase, which is based on three types of jumping steps: a simple hopping jump, a double jump and dash jump. The standing figures are performed in these three fixed types, but the choreutic sequence—that is, the choreography—varies. The standing phase is articulated in standstill (or near standstill) figures and moving figures. The standstill figures, performed with a simple hop, simple side-step and simple front-back steps, or the double jump, yield the following particular figures:

a) arms relaxed at the sides of the body, head bent forward, head thrown back;
b) arms relaxed at the hips, holding a colored cloth at both ends;
c) one arm relaxed at the side of the body, while the other arm, raised, twirls the cloth;
d) arms forward, bent slightly inward, holding the cloth at both ends at the height of the waist or the head;
e) bent arms with hands on the hips;
f) one arm relaxed at the side of the body, while the other is bent at a hip;
g) one arm bent at the hip while the other bent slightly forward waves the colored cloth sideways;
h) arms up high, bent slightly outward, thrashing the colored cloth;
i) arms bent forward holding the colored cloth stretched out across the chest;
j) bent arms, one raised in front, the other lowered to the back, holding the cloth at both ends stretched behind the back;
k) arms bent at the height of the head, holding the colored cloth at both ends stretched behind the neck;
{) a jump on one foot acting as a pivot, while the other planted on the ground follows;
m) a jump on one foot while the other foot crosses it, drawing near and moving away;
n) a jump across the colored cloth with arms outstretched obliquely;
0) a jump across the colored cloth with arms outstretched in front, hands together, or even clapping them. The figures in motion, performed with a simple jump, double jump or dash step, basically repeat the standstill figures. The dash step can be in long steps or short steps, in the later case becoming a rhythmic step. In general, the choreutic itinerary is circular, following the ceremonial perimeter. The conclusion of the entire choreutic cycle takes place in the standing phase: the tarantata begins to perform a series of concentric circles with increasingly short radii, with simple or double jumping steps, which quickly becomes an unstable pirouette and a concluding caracole: the tarantata then returns to the resting, supine position (photos d-i).

Particular Observations. When Maria of Nardé reawakened on the morning of June 26, a hysterical arch was observed, corresponding to the choreutic figure called “the bridge”; the arch marked the beginning of a series of regular choreutic cycles. In the case of Rosaria of Nardé, the standip figures featured a variation with a pillow, interpreted by the audience present as an imitation (“mythical”) sort of taranta. During the reconstruction by the female informant of Muro Le the following variants were performed: a) running around a chair with bent arms at the height of th. head, holding the colored cloth by both ends; b) seated Position: the entire body thrown back and sideways, rhythmic oscillation of the colored cloth held at both ends (photo jo).

Dex. 1c: In the on-the-floor phase of tarantism’s liturgical tarantella, the moment of the rene zooanthropic identification is symbolically manifested by drawing in the legs, rotating the bog ty using the head as a pivot, crawling on the back, moving on the knees or all fours, a mimicry of squeezing into tight spaces or climbing acrobatically, and in short, anything that imitates q incapable of standing erect, stuck close to the ground, which acts more or less like a “taranta.” The standing phase, a more agonistic movement, at one time characterized by the sword dane, is now displayed with the rhythmic thrashing of the colored cloth, which symbolically reflects “colors” of the poisoning taranta.

During the event that takes place in the chapel on June 28 and 29, the lack of music ~ q therefore the regulating function of rhythm — provokes a clear disarticulation of the bipartite choreutic cycle dominant in the home ritual: the dance patterns appear fragmentary and chaotic and as part of the behavior taken as a whole, closer to morbid psychic states than to the ritual which brings resolution (see photos 16-18 of the choreutic cycle of Maria of Nardé).

From the observation notes in the chapel, we see that the aranrati and their families attempt to reconstruct the conditions of the home cure as best they can, helping themselves by singing pizzica-tarantata passages and clapping their hands rhythmically to substitute the accompaniment of the tambourine.

Ex. 1d: Primus modus Tarantella Repeated several times ee 16: Secundus modus The disarticulation of the choreutic patterns in the chapel due to the lack of musical instrument demonstrates the organic connection between choreutic patterns and musical patterns in the mythical-ritual symbol of tarantism.

This musical structure displays many features in common with some types of “primitive” music (West Africa) and with jazz. Indeed, there is a clear division between the beat of the rhythmic section (organetto, tambourine and guitar) and the offbeat of the violin, shown above all in the syncopation and repeated notes.' 'The isometric character of the beat is not monotonous, since it is variously accented; as for the offbeat, the emphasis is not given by the type of melody used, but by the performance mode, from which we get the r______ The iatromusical keys we recorded both during the home cure and through reconstruction are A major, D major, B minor, and A minor. According to the musicians, the single tarantati are stimulated to dance only by one of these keys, while they remain indifferent to others. This fact would fit in with the phenomenon, widely documented in the historical literature on tarantism, of the preference of individual rarantati for a particular music within a traditionalized repertory of patterns available to the community. Nonetheless, from our direct experience in the home cures we witnessed, a preference of this sort did not emerge in a clear way: on the contrary, we had the impression that this aspect of tarantism had by now dropped out of common awareness.

In the instrumental combination we observed during the cure, the violin and the tambourine were the leading instruments: the former represented the melodic section and the latter the rhythmic one, together with the organetto® and the guitar. In the earliest literature on tarantism, we find a much greater variety of instruments used:* rebecs (Bruni), drums, tambourines, zampogne, panpipes, horns, guitars, lyres, zithers, harpsichords, bombardons (Kircher); guitar, violin, tambourine with white and yellow tin bells, French musette, Sicilian ciaramelli (Boccone); harps, lutes (Valletta).* The instruments currently used in the musical therapy of tarantism fit in with this tradition, since the violin is connected to the tradition of string instruments and in particular that of the rebec; the tambourine is linked to the percussion instruments; while the organetto can be considered the substitute for the zampogna due to its analogous structure as a wind instrument (a frequent substitution in Italian folk music).

In relation to the fact that the rhythm is the determining element of tarantism’s iatromusic, the question arises as to whether the original rhythm of the tarantella is double or triple time. The examples of Kircher's iatromusic are certainly in 4/4 time, as are the examples collected by us in the summer of 1959 (or at least they are basically so, since from the accentual point of view it is an oscillating 4/4). The only example in 12/8 is the one which Storace collected in Torre Annunziata at the end of the 1700s: we may therefore presume the likelihood of the hypothesis that the passage from 4/4 to 12/8 was due to a process of stylization from folk to high or semi-high culture: confirmation of this seems given by the singular circumstances in which Storace's document was collected (cf. pp. 93 ff). In effect, in folk music, rhythms in eighths and quarters are sometimes quite distinct, while in other cases it is difficult to decide if it is a triplet or dotted note: this depends on the expressionistic character of this type of music. Additionally, the examples of iatromusic we recorded are very close to the most archaic examples of Italian folk music.
