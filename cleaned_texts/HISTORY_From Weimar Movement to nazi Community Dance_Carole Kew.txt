From Weimar Movement Choir to Nazi Community Dance: The Rise and Fall of Rudolf Laban's Festkultur

Carole Kew

Rudolf Laban is known as the catalyst of the diverse German Ausdruckstanz (expressive dance) scene, which contributed to the cultural vibrancy of the Weimar Republic. His career initially continued its upward path after the Nazi regime took power in 1933, culminating in 1934 with responsibility for all German dance as head of the Deutsche Tanzbühne. However, Laban's status was short-lived. In 1936, his dance production Vom Tauwind und der Neuen Freude (Of the Spring Wind and the New Joy) was banned by Josef Goebbels, the Minister for Enlightenment and Propaganda, following his attendance at the dress rehearsal.

Factors in Laban's dance history that may shed light on this continuity and abrupt censure remain only partially explored. Elucidating this continuity and censure became the central concern in an enquiry initiated through the question: Could an argument be developed that amongst Laban's eclectic philosophical influences, an ideological thread could be traced that allowed a continuity between the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich?

Published accounts of Laban and the Nazi period suggested possible threads. In particular, two points that appeared on the periphery of Martin Green's discussion of Asconan culture were moved center-stage in this enquiry. Firstly, Laban's similarities to völkisch thought became a lens through which to view both his continuity and censure, and secondly, Laban's 'unpolitical' position could be explored in greater depth.

Using Gadamer's hermeneutics, an interpretation was created based on contemporaneous writings together with an analysis of Of the Spring Wind and the New Joy. This choice of methodology was selected as many Third Reich source materials are missing, destroyed, or simply absent. A hermeneutic approach, allowing an imaginative enquiry of extant materials, provided an alternative perspective from which to view events of this period. This enquiry is seen as a point of departure for further research, rather than a definitive point of closure on the subject.

The argument that I develop is that a völkisch ideology both facilitated the transition of Laban's movement choirs into the Third Reich and also contributed to Laban's ultimate demise. In developing this argument, I share Susan Manning's opinion that socio-political contexting is crucial to an understanding of Ausdruckstanz and the Nazi period.

In examining Laban's Of the Spring Wind and the New Joy, I follow Helen Thomas' sociology of dance and discuss the extent to which this dance was 'a reflexive bodily activity' that spoke both to and of the society in which it was created and performed. In this way, intrinsic analysis and extrinsic contexting combine with my own perception to create an interpretation of the past.

The entry-point into the hermeneutic enquiry was via the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who became a major influence on early twentieth-century German culture, including völkisch thought. From 1890, Nietzsche was called upon as ideological support for a variety of societal and cultural groupings. In his perceived critique of contemporary civilization and 'quest for personal, political and cultural recovery,' Nietzsche became the touchstone for exploring concerns of individual and collective identity. "Above all, Nietzsche's dynamic celebration of creativity and 'the creation of new values and norms' appealed to the young: 'To be something new, to signify something new, to represent new values.' In the poetic, ecstatic and emancipatory style of his writing, Nietzsche pre-figured life as an experience lived beyond conventional boundaries. The prime reason why Nietzsche would have influenced dancers in particular was his celebration of dance. Nietzsche's Zarathustra said: 'And we should consider every day lost on which we have not danced at least once', words which Laban used to accompany Of the Spring Wind and the New Joy. For Laban, Zarathustra was 'the complete embodiment of human culture.' However, Nietzsche's first work, The Birth of Tragedy, was also a key influence on dancers. In this work, Nietzsche outlined his concept of the Apolline and Dionysiac opposites which became a descriptive shorthand used by dancers in 1920's Germany. The Apolline usually represented the reasoned, consciously ordered form of the physical world. But for Nietzsche, this outer form was only a world of appearance. Opposing this world was the Dionysiac inner reality – a metaphysical world of 'blissful ecstasy' which 'pays no heed to the individual, but even seeks to destroy individuality and redeem it with a mystical sense of unity.' Here, singing and dancing, man expresses himself as a member of a higher community; he has forgotten how to walk and talk, and is about to fly dancing into the heavens. His gestures express enchantment. In this world, 'man is no longer an artist, he has become a work of art.' In Germany, dance, as an embodied work of art, became more associated with the Dionysiac 'inner reality' of unconscious ecstatic movement than the Apolline outer appearance of consciously-shaped form. Writing in 1919, the year which saw the birth of the Weimar Republic, Laban's friend, the dance critic Hans Brandenburg, praised The Birth of Tragedy as privileging this Dionysiac tragic culture over that of the Alexandrian-Apolline. Nietzsche was a classics scholar, and his interpretation of the Dionysiac and Apolline can be traced back to Ancient Greece. In pre-Socratic Greece, the gods Apollo and Dionysus were worshiped on different occasions. Apollo represented the martial activity of war dances while the god Dionysus was celebrated in cultic/theatrical Spring festivals representing rebirth and renewal. Originally performed by amateurs, this Dionysiac dance of ecstatic abandon eventually became the choric dance of Greek tragedy with the dancers mediating between actors and audience in a festive/artistic community celebration. In The Birth of Tragedy, Nietzsche advocated the regeneration of German culture through a reawakening of this Dionysiac spirit. Here, German culture would find 'a blissful self-rediscovery.' This combination of Dionysiac festivity linked to cultural renewal became a potent force in German vélkisch thought. The term Volk signified more than a 'people' or nation. Through a process of mystical fusion, the individual was seen to access a higher reality beyond the material world of superficial reason and Enlightenment thought. This fusion was seen as the source of individual creativity through union with the creative process of a higher life force, a process that would simultaneously invigorate the wider Volk culture. Vélkisch thought, as it developed from Romanticism, argued that individual union with this higher reality was to be achieved through a space/time connection: space – through a pantheistic fusion with nature and the cosmos, where the individual functioned as a microcosm within the macrocosm; and time – through the historical continuity with a Volk tradition." Being rooted in the cosmic rhythms of nature and in the ‘roots’ of a Volk cultural heritage were to become the regenerative sources that would transform the individual into a creative being. Nietzsche's celebration of the Dionysiac contributed to an erosion of belief in the Christian religion and led, in some vélkisch circles, to an engagement with neo-pagan practices, including festivities celebrating the life-force of the sun. It was within this cultural context that The Birth of Tragedy became one of the formative influences on Laban's dance theory and practice. Nietzsche's vision of Dionysiac collective ecstasy proved the catalyst with the choric dance of Greek tragedy becoming the apotheosis of artistic activity. In Nietzsche's words: "The chorus in Greek tragedy [is] the symbol of the crowd in a Dionysiac state... The stage, and the action, were fundamentally and originally conceived only as a vision, that the sole 'reality' is the chorus, which generates the vision from within itself, and speaks of it with all the symbolism of dance, sound, and words." For Laban, the combination of these three principles of dance, sound, and words formed the foundational basis for his dance practice. Together, they would create a rounded education of the whole person and lead to a re-birth, not just of dance, but also of the festive culture advocated by Nietzsche. In 1913, Laban started to put these principles into practice at his summer dance school in Ascona. The school brochure reads: "Our thinking apparatus, our feeling apparatus, and our muscular system can be fully developed and controlled in the most supreme and sensible way through DANCE-SOUND-WoRD." These principles are repeated and extended in Laban's autobiography A Life for Dance, where he talks of "the clearly delineated trinity of dance — sound — word" and Die Welt des Tainzers (The World of the Dancer), where Laban talks of "rites as symbolic actions" and continues: "The context of ritual is the festival... Every ritual arises out of dance, sound, and word."

Laban's ideas on a festive culture, or Festkultur, developed during his youth in Munich. From 1912-1913, Laban was commissioned to work for the Munich carnival celebrations. After two seasons, he was keen to develop his own work beyond what he saw as the "trivial cabaret atmosphere of carnival." His escape was to Ascona in the foothills of the Swiss Alps, where he established his summer school. Planned as more than a dance school, its conception was for festive celebrations "of the spiritual life." Dancers performed semi-nude in the open air and celebrated the cosmic rhythms of nature. Laban's major Asconan dance, performed in 1917, was Sang an die Sonne (Song to the Sun), a festive celebration that started at dusk and, lit by bonfires, was performed at intervals during the night until the sun rose at dawn. Later, Laban wrote down his thoughts on Festkultur. In a 1922 article, he conceived of Festkultur as the "dawning of a new flowering of mankind," which would overcome the loneliness and desperation of individuals and their "nausea caused by the social facade and religious hypocrisy." For Laban, festivals had become shams (Scheinfesten) showing simply their "outer appearance." Festivals had been "misused, misconstrued, and corroded" by the state, the church, and families, with celebrations of a political nature being particularly criticized: "Politics blossoms where the will to life is farthest from the will to festivals. In this way, the symbolic nature of festivals had been lost and could only be recovered through dance as the basis for a reawakened Festkultur. This reclamation of festive celebration is discussed by Walter Jacob in the 1926 issue of Die Schönheit devoted to Laban. Jacob denounces carnivals as a pseudo-culture"' (Scheinkultur) and calls for a restoration of the lost Festkultur of Ancient Greece. Here, for Jacob, is the highest development of Festkultur. In their affirmation of the body in cultic dance, the Greeks showed a ‘cultic ecstasy’ (Rultrausch) which had been destroyed by Christianity. Laban saw the amateur “movement choir” as a means of re-awakening this earlier Festkultur.

Movement choirs were promoted as a way of bringing ritual-symbolic festivals back into everyday life - special occasions where people could take pleasure in a mystical merging with a mass in a cultic celebration. The precise religious content remained undefined, stemming from Laban’s own eclectic philosophical influences. His aim appears to have been the achievement of an uplifting, ecstatic state suffused with mysticism. As he wrote in 1926, he was seeking a ‘higher reality’ beyond a world which was ‘simply appearance’.

Amateur movement choirs became larger and more diverse in content during the 1920s. Mass choreographies also grew in popularity, being performed as much for political purposes through co-ordinators such as the Socialist Martin Glöhsner as for cultic celebration. Laban was sceptical about some of these applications of his movement choir concept. In 1930 he warned against using amateur dance for propaganda purposes or in a political or ideological way. For Laban, a choric dance festival was where the individual merged with the supra-personal, the content not annexed to any specific ideology.

However, whilst holding choric dance free of ideology, Laban also promoted it in this same article as a ‘new folk dance movement of the white race’ which he differentiated from ‘fashionable social dances which show an invasion of foreign racial movements’. By locating choric dance within a völkisch movement heritage, yet simultaneously distancing it from a political or ideological agenda, Laban left the way open for the continuity of this dance form within the Nazi racial state.

Under the Nazis, the movement choir concept was renamed ‘community dance’ (Gemeinschaftstanz) and formalised under the Ministry for Enlightenment and Propaganda. Community dance was promoted as a modern version of the country folk dance but linked to cities, the theory being that those who were removed from the natural rhythms of nature could get in touch with the ‘cosmic flow of life embodied in everything mortal’.

It was advocated as a new folk art (Volkskunst) which would ‘take people out of their everyday experiences and — perhaps unconsciously — feel themselves merging with the cosmos’ in festivals. However, by promoting community dance as a folk dance, primarily a social dance activity, the extent to which the dance was audience-focused was unclear. A further complication was introduced — the new homage to an external agency, Hitler, as the community leader. The 1936 community dance booklet Wir tanzen (We Dance) says: "We have outgrown the ‘T’ and the ‘You’ times and become the ‘We’ time — not that we are simply a mass but a racial community (Volksgemeinschaft), led by the Führer and our amateur dance means to lead and to be led." Unlike the Greek choric dance in honour of Dionysus, the object of worship is now unclear. A 1936 article in Der Tanz discusses Rudolf Laban's Festkultur and raises the question: "What is being worshipped?" The article speculates that the object of worship may be the creative work itself or the Volk community. This theme is taken up again in July 1936, after Laban's dance was banned. Beda Prilipp writes that he heard the taboo word 'cultic' and asks who is the cult worshipping. He questions whether the dance is an escape from everyday life to honor their gods in a consecrated circle or holy grove. The dance is a 'return home,' but Prilipp concludes that the meaning is lost on the majority of the audience.

The article raises the second problem: with no shared cultural bond of dance as a cultic activity, how much were amateur movement choirs geared towards performance? Laban himself seems unclear on this point. At the beginning of a 1930 article, his view is that amateur dance focuses on the intrinsic pleasure of the dancer in performance rather than any consideration of the audience. Later in the same article, Laban modifies his view to one where the 'primitive surrendering' of the dancers becomes a communal uplifting experience for the spectators. This ambiguity in the inner/outer focus of the dance proved a further barrier to shared meaning in a culture where a shared communal experience was paramount.

The desire for a communal uplifting experience is reflected in the content of Laban's Of the Spring Wind and the New Joy, subtitled 'a festive dance-piece.' The dance was scheduled to be performed on 31 July 1936, the day before the opening of the Olympic Games, to inaugurate the Dietrich-Eckart open-air theatre on the Olympic complex. Created in over 30 cities simultaneously by 1,000 young people (using Laban's dance notation) and rehearsed during the eight days of the pre-Olympic community dance festival, the dress rehearsal took place before an invited audience on 20 June 1936. From the few photographs, the programme, and a description in the commemorative booklet Wir Tanzen, it is possible to enquire into the content, if not the precise movement, of Laban's choreography. The original 1935 proposal submitted to the Ministry for Enlightenment and Propaganda for approval provides further insight into the content. Although this proposal may not reflect the final content entirely, the dance structure remains the same, and the content reflects the accompanying spoken text from Also Sprach Zarathustra: "O my soul, I taught you how to say 'Today' as I taught you 'Once' and 'In earlier times' and above all the here and there to dance away with your circles (Reigen)! Is it only in dance that I find a way of talking about the highest things? Since there have been people, man has not rejoiced enough."

This above all is our inheritance from the earth, my brothers! If we can learn to have more pleasure, then we will unlearn best how to do others harm and to imagine how to strive. It is not where you come from that gives you honour but: where you are going with your will and your feet, which want to rise above you. And so I want man and woman: one fit for war and the other fit for birth, but both fit for dance in their head and legs! Lost is every day on which we have not danced. And every truth is false which does not include laughter!"

The Dietrich-Eckart stage was modelled on a Greek amphi- theatre against the backdrop of a forest. The dancers were dressed in identical neo-classical costumes. The few extant photographs show dancers performing simple movements in unison. The dance is described as a solemn festival designed to create ‘unforgettable images and impressions for the audience’. The dance structure is in four parts:

1) Struggle (Kampf), stimulated by Zarathustra’s ‘fighting nature’ (Kampflust). Herc, light and dark costumed figures show the sym- bolic struggle in earlier times for Lebensraum (living space).”” The dance shows ‘Yesterday’: the ‘horror of war and the suffering of the post-war period’.” Choirs of defeated warriors and mourning 80 THE RISE AND FALL OF RUDOLF LABAN’S FESTKULTUR women depict a time when the German pcople had no faith in themselves. Morale and discipline had been lost.”
2) Reflection (Besinnung): a slow section denoting ‘inward contem- plation on the origins of life in order to gain strength in readiness for a new form to emerge’.™ Reflection ends with bells, fanfarcs and Dietrich Eckart’s ‘storm song’ (Sturmlied) Germany Awake! (Deutsch- land Erwache!).” People gradually unite in the racial community (Volksgemeinschaft).
3) Joy (Freude): a fast section denoting a time of activity and progress. Joy shows “Today”: a ‘work symphony’ with a choir of workers and a choir of mothers and wives, all working with joy to create the new state. Morale and discipline are restored.
4) Consecration (Weihe) shows German men and women in prayer after work, joined together in the Germanic sunwhceel (Sonnenrad), ‘the symbol of our ancestors and our Volksgemeinschaft, the eternal light, towards which we all strive’."" The sunwheel transforms into large, swinging, celebratory circles. The final circle linked the stage space with the audience in a ‘rapturous unity’."

Goebbels wrote in his diary on the banning of this dance: Dance rehearsal: freely based on Nietzsche, a bad, contrived and affected piece. I forbid much of it. It is all so intellectual. I do not like that. It goes around dressed in our clothes and has nothing whatever to do with us."* Community dance was intended to be the ‘expressive embodi- ment’ (Ausdrucksgestaltung) of the ideas of the time, but Gocbbels’ banning suggests a problematic embodiment. If dance is, as Helen Thomas suggests, ‘a reflexive bodily activity which inheres sets of emergent meanings’ with dance speaking not only of but also to the society in which it is created and performed,” what was the problem with Laban's dance? The dance imagery apparently showed the outer appearance (the ‘clothes’) of the Nazi regime but not its inner reality. The ‘clothes’ appear to have been the sun- wheel (rather than the hooked cross Hakenkreuz of the swastika); the gender stereotyping shown in Zarathustra’s words ‘men ready for war and women ready for birth’; Dietrich Eckart’s rallying Nazi song Germany Awake! and the ‘joy’ of a communal, festive present portrayed in Nazi propaganda. However, the Nazi regime also invoked a mythical future where sacrificial death in war was a desirable attribute. This attribute was encoded in the dance pageant Olympic Youth performed on the opening night of the Olympic Games. Laban’s view differed. 81 DANCE RESEARCH

Reflecting on the 1914-1918 war in his autobiography, Laban does remark favorably on the soldiers’ ‘readiness to make sacrifices’ and on the ‘comradeship shown’. However, for Laban these were simply factors that made sense of the ‘madness’ and ‘horrifying events’. This attitude is reflected in his banned dance where war was shown as a past negative experience with the present as a joyous end-state.

Dancing imagery showing the horror of war with defeated warriors rather than an invocation to a future heroic death could therefore have brought Goebbels’ censure. Although Laban’s dance bore the outer appearance of conforming to Nazi ideology, the inner reality did not sufficiently encode Nazi martial values. Laban’s dance may have been speaking of the society in which it was created and performed, but not sufficiently to it.

The dance content may not have been the only factor to trigger Goebbels’ censure. While the dance apparently celebrated the ‘new joy’ of social and cultural renewal in the Nazi state, the rehearsal programme does not describe the content but simply states that ‘despite introductory quotations from Zarathustra, the dance sequences are not illustrations of any particular train of thought or events’. This leaves the decoding of the dance open to each individual audience member.

Laban’s dance was ‘intellectual’ in that it could be read in different ways and therefore could encourage independent thought which was negated by the Nazi state. Instead, the ideological message needed to be read unmistakably. Working paralinguistically, as in Of the Spring Wind and the New Joy, may have assisted a collective interpretation but the text was ‘freely based on Nietzsche’. The dance may have left too many opportunities for personal interpretations for it to be presented on the night before the opening of the Olympic Games.

Ultimately, Laban’s dance proved unsuitable both as a communal bonding mechanism supporting Nazi values and as a sufficiently unambiguous communication tool. The banning of Laban’s dance signaled both his own fall in status and that of community dance. By the end of 1937, the term ‘community dance’ had been officially dropped, and Laban had left Germany.

Laban’s Festkultur project took shape within the myriad völkisch circles seeking a Nietzschean cultural and personal renewal in fin-de-siécle Germany. Laban’s emphasis on mysticism, his nco-Romantic celebration of nature and cosmic rhythms, his appeal to a Volk heritage of Ancient Greece all combined to create his radical mission of cultural and individual regencration through a communal Dionysiac Festkultur. Laban’s promotion of völkisch cultural renewal facilitated the initial transition of choric dance from the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich.

Hitler took what he saw as the core ideas of völkisch thought and formed a political creed aimed at turning the diffuse, idealistic aspirations of the diverse volkisch groups into a political movement with a practical goal. Aryan racial supremacy and anti-Semitism were the foundations of this movement with an expansionist policy geared to achieving Lebensraum for the racial community as the goal, with war the means to this end. Laban's Festkultur originated within a broad volkisch context. Laban's project was essentially cultural rather than political, and he rejected the use of movement choirs as political vehicles. Laban's separation of politics and culture can be interpreted through exploring the specifically German juxtaposition of Zivilisation and Kultur.

Laban's Festkultur can be identified with the concept of Kultur. For Laban, it was important that the dancer relinquished the enticements of contemporary civilisation as exemplified in city life. He denigrated the city as inhabited by the 'robot' and controlled by the stock exchange, a divisive site of class struggle where people visited cabarets and danced 'movements foreign to our race'. From Laban's vélkisch perspective, the enforced passivity of the body in the office environment, the mechanisation of the body in industrial processes, the separation of management from workers, and the competitive nature of the market economy merged with the fashionable articulated movements and syncopated rhythms of jazz in a rejection of Western liberal modernity.

City life for Laban showed clamour and confusion, dissonance and discord, replacing the mystical harmony and unity of the eternal cosmic cycles of nature. Through his Festkultur, Laban brought a new form of communal dance to the cities, where the dancer's role was to perceive behind the external events of the material world into 'the land of silence, the realm of the soul'. Like the Whirling Dervishes whom Laban admired in his youth, Laban thought that contacting this 'hidden, forgotten landscape' could 'tell us about important realities.'" Laban's detachment from the contemporary events of Zivilisation and his movement choir mission to bring a regenerative, mystical Festkultur to the cities led him to reject movement choirs being used for political purposes.

Laban also saw war as part of the pseudo-culture (Scheinkultur) of Zivilisation and opposed to the enduring, honourable strengths of human nature (Urkraft) found in Kultur. Perhaps for this reason, Laban's ethical view of combat, as described in his autobiography, seems remote from the realities of warfare as practised in the early twentieth century. Instead, his view of combat seems to be based on a pre-modern concept such as Ancient Greece. Laban's praise for dances of combat, such as sword dances, as teaching 'good conduct in battle' bear little relation to the artillery mass slaughter in the 1914-1918 trenches. Neither does the emerging strategy of aerial bombing conform to Laban's notion of 'fair fighting' which excluded 'bombing houses and burying healthy soldiers, women, children, the old and the crippled beneath the ruins'.

This disengagement from contemporary events and rejection of Zivilisation is again shown in Laban's reaction to the outbreak of the 1914-1918 war. Remote in his Swiss summer school, Laban describes in his autobiography how he was taken by surprise at the outbreak of war. His prime concern was the danger to his emerging dance project. But Laban then describes the war as a transformational point in what was to become his Festkultur project. Through reflecting on the war, Laban's dance mission changed from concern with dances based on his own experience to a concern with, firstly the young dancers in his care as his 'instrument', but secondly to a wider 'obligation and responsibility towards the larger community of all those whom my art could be expected to serve'. Dance itself became the transformational instrument of a cultural mission located outside the material world of Zivilisation, the world of the market economy of 'customers', 'buyers' and 'producers'. Instead, what was at stake for Laban was the hidden world of the 'universal soul out of which and for which we have to create' where 'we are all one'.

This völkisch idea of transformation of both the individual and society through contacting a 'universal soul' foreshadowed Laban's later mission of Festkultur. Like the title of Laban's 1929 choric dance Everyday and Festival (Alltag und Fest), dance was seen as separate from the ephemeral, 'everyday' world of Civilisation. Instead, dance connected the individual through the festival in a mystical way to the inner reality of an enduring Kultur. This separation of Kultur and Zivilisation may begin to explain Laban's engagement with Nazism through the separation of culture and politics, but an important point remains unresolved. How could Laban have denigrated using movement choirs for ideological purposes yet not seen that he himself was operating within an idcological völkisch framework? As late as 1935, Laban still proposed that the value of dance lay solely in the dance movement experience, unconnected with the communication of 'ideological (weltanschaulich), political and scientific ideas'. Where dance consciously represented ideology, Laban still viewed this as an "abuse" of movement choirs because "the movement experience retreated into the background." Yet whilst Laban stressed the importance of the non-ideological and universal movement experience of his choirs, he also saw dance as racially determined. This creates an apparent contradiction: How could Laban not have seen that his dance was operating within a "world view" (a Weltanschauung), one based on the ideology of the Volk?

Perhaps this contradiction can be resolved by contexting within the late nineteenth century emergence of the Aryan myth of racial superiority. A fascination with the Indo-Europeans (or Aryans as they were then called) and their origins formed part of the intellectual climate of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. This obsession with Aryans was not created by the Nazis but formed part of a widespread belief in the innate superiority of the Aryan race, a belief which became prevalent in European academic and intellectual thought.

Although not limited to Germany, such views reached their extreme in Hitler's virulent anti-Semitism with the Aryans described in Mein Kampf as the "founders of culture." As early as 1920, Laban was familiar with the term "Aryan-European" and referred to dance "of the white race." With his view of dance as racially determined, Laban can be seen as operating within the ideological framework of a Volk heritage based on the widespread belief in racial superiority, an imagined racial heritage which included Ancient Greece.

Operating within such a widely accepted racist belief system could have precluded Laban from seeing the contradictions in his statements which are evident today. Perhaps, as Edward T. Hall suggests, "culture hides more than it reveals, and ... what it hides, it hides most effectively from its participants."

This discussion of the völkisch connection may begin to explain Laban's continuity from the Weimar Republic to the Nazi regime but Laban's subsequent censure requires further enquiry. Although Of the Spring Wind and the New Joy failed as a cultural communication tool for Nazi values, were there also extrinsic political factors leading to Laban's demise and the demotion of cultic choric dance?

Although Nazism took core ideas from the völkisch tradition, in Mein Kampf Hitler ridiculed the term völkisch as vague and able to accommodate a multiplicity of opinions. Such a loose term left open the possibility of permitting individual interpretation of the concept in contrast to the "strict fighting solidarity" required in a political struggle.

The single-minded goal set out in Mein Kampf precluded any competition to Nazism, including broader völkisch thought. If the first three years of the Nazi regime marked the period of co-ordination within the cultural sphere, 1936 marked the turning point from a concern with achieving an internally co-ordinated state to preparations for territorial expansion through war.

The four-year plan announced on 9 September 1936 set in motion war preparations with a corresponding hardening in cultural policy. This shift in cultural policy can be traced back to Goebbels' speech of 16 September 1935 where he denounced the use of the words "cult" (Kult) and "mysticism" (Mystik). This may explain Beda Prilipp's 1936 comment on Laban's banned dance: "Don't I hear that taboo word cultic surfacing again?" Cultic and völkisch theatri-cal productions were gradually being replaced with strictly Nazi festivals. Unlike Of the Spring Wind and the New Joy, where ‘the object of worship was unclear’, explicit Nazi ritual promoting the Führer cult with Hitler as a messianic leader was favored. It is interesting to compare the fate of the Nazi's own attempt at völkisch choric drama, the Thingspiel, with the fate of community dance (as Susan Manning has suggested). The Thingspiel was a didactic choric performance using speech choirs as well as mass movement. Thingspiel sites were built on a Greek amphitheater model with forty sites being constructed across Germany in the first years of Nazi rule. It was a Frankenburger Würfel-Spiel (Frankenburg Game of Dice) which replaced Laban's dance as the opening performance of the Dietrich-Eckart amphitheater. Here, the text draws an analogy with Hitler in promoting the ideal of a redemptive 'good leader'. Through the re-enactment of an historical event, the betrayed dead are raised and the 'bad leader' punished with the words: 'A Kaiser who crucifies his people shall be damned for all eternity.” Compared to Laban's dance, the imagery and text are explicit: revenge for an injustice with a redemptive leader saving the Volk community. The extent to which these attributes were encoded in Laban's dance requires some conjecture due to the ambiguity present. With no 'redemptive leader' imagery encoded in the dance, the 'object of worship' remained ambiguous.

A similar ambiguity may appear in the question of the avenged dead. The cult of the fallen soldier was a familiar myth from nineteenth-century Germany. This myth was taken up in the Weimar Republic where the dead of the 1914-1918 war were seen to work symbolically with the living for the restoration of Germany. The Nazis annexed this cult and used it in their propaganda. Dietrich Eckart's text Germany Awake!, which was scheduled to accompany Laban's dance, does refer to calling the dead from their graves and to revenge. In addition, there may be an allusion in the title word Tauwind. In Biblical symbolism, Tau was 'dew' falling from heaven, which revived dead souls. This allusion, if intended, still leaves the dance open to individual interpretation: Tauwind, the Spring wind, could also symbolize a Dionysiac Spring festival celebration along Ancient Greek lines.

Even if the text contains this oblique reference, what still seems crucially missing from the choreography is revenge. There is no projection into a glorious heroic future, and no vengeful salvation for the fallen dead of the 1914-1918 war through another war. Despite the more explicit promotion of Nazi values in the Thingspiel, the word 'Thing' was also denounced in Goebbels' 1935 speech and by 1937 the Thingspiel had been dropped completely from the Nazi propaganda programme. Nazism was now operating increasingly like a secular religion, an analogy which Goebbels himself acknowledged in this same speech with his comparison of the promotion of Nazism to the operation of the Catholic faith.

Replacing both cultic choric dance and the Thingspiel, Nazi festivities and ceremonial days supported by the new media of radio and film proved more suitable as promoters of propaganda. The modern mass media were also more cost-effective and suitable for wartime transmission. Mass outdoor theatrical productions not only reached fewer people, they were also impractical in war-time. By 1938, the cultic significance of dance and its Ancient Greek völkisch heritage had disappeared. Writing in Der Tanz, Godlewski says that whilst dance could arise from cultic or other religious origins, "West Europeans are not (or better put: are no longer) attuned to cultic dance." As the Nazi regime prepared for war and their cultural policy hardened and shifted away from mass theatrical vékisch productions towards the use of Nazi ritual and modern mass media, Laban's Festkultur project ended.

Intrinsically, Laban's banned dance did not sufficiently encode Nazi martial values or promote the Führer cult. Dance also proved problematic as a communication tool. Extrinsically, Goebbels' ban coincided with a changing socio-political climate. As preparations for war were stepped up, Laban's Festkultur was replaced with a strictly Nazi idca of festive culture.

So what replaced Laban's Festkultur and the amateur movement choir? In a 1937 book reviewing the current state of dance, Edith von Lélhoffel starts her article with a dismissive discussion of amateur movement choirs, which are spoken of in the past tense. The subject was 'brought up endlessly' but remained in 'clever discussions' with the 'living community' missing: 'If it was difficult enough to reawaken the folk dance in small village communities, it must have been even more difficult to bring together a whole city or massed millions of Volk.' Lölhoffel then suggests that the appropriate 'community dance' for the Third Reich can be found in the march which she calls 'the descendant of war dances' and continues:

"The warlike strict discipline of the national socialist movement has found its natural expression in the festive march ... The march belongs to every community festival. It gives strength and direction and a wonderful feeling of being high ... It accompanies the Führer and followers, pulls the masses together and forces millions together in the same step. It is the true national expression of our feeling for life and community."

Reflecting the drive towards rearmament and the mobilisation of the population for war, dance is no longer seen as playing a significant role in Nazi festivals but is relegated to a position of 'harmless pleasure' as light relief from marching.

In this way, the synchronised rhythm of the uniform Apolline march replaced the cultic Dionysiac amateur movement choir as the 'community dance' to be performed at Nazi festivals. Laban's movement choirs, which celebrated, in his words, both a 'sense of mutuality and the appreciation of the identity of each individual," had been replaced by the conformity and anonymity of the march supporting an expansionist policy geared to war.

In Gadamer's hermeneutics, understanding is not simply relating the text to the context but crucially includes application, that is, 'the mediation ... of past meaning into the present situation.' Perhaps the warning from this enquiry is that dancers need to be aware of the political context in which they are performing. Immersion in a Dionysiac 'inner reality' does not encourage a reflexive engagement with the activity nor with the Apolline political world of 'outer appearance.' What Laban valued in the dancer was the ability to experience directly (erleben), not solely to understand (verstehen), values based on active participation in events rather than reasoned reflection, values which the Nazi regime exploited in their propaganda. In the end, perhaps Laban failed to note Nietzsche's comment in "The Birth of Tragedy" on immersion in the Dionysiac: "Whenever Dionysiac excitements have reached a significant level, we may always sense how the Dionysiac release from the fetters of individuation is made tangible in a diminution, to the point of indifference or even hostility, of political feelings."
