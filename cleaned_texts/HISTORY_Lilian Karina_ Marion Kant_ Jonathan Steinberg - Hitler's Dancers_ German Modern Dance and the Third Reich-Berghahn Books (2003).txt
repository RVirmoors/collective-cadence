Subject entries Dance provides another one of the inner connections between the grandiose rallies and the spectacles of fascist politics, politics as aesthetics or theater, as Walter Benjamin famously put it. My ignorance is not unique to me. Ask any group of well-read Europeans or Americans if they have heard of Arnold Schenberg or Vasily Kandinsky, and they will look at you with astonishment. Of course, they know those names. Try Rudolf von Laban on them and you will find that they have never heard of the Kandinsky or Schonberg of the dance world, and that they do not realize their ignorance.

Why one of the greatest Western art forms—think of the popularity of Swan Lake or The Fire-Bird—should not be regarded as worthy of study in our principal academies continues to puzzle me. Consider whether a university would be complete without the history of literature, the history of art or the history of music, then ask how many of them teach the history of dance. Think about the importance of dance in every ancient, medieval, tribal, aristocratic or bourgeois culture, and then reflect on how little the educated person seems to know about it.

This book attempts to fill a small but important gap in our understanding of the twentieth century and does so through the medium of dance: the role of dance in the emergence and consolidation of National Socialism in Germany. It has three parts, very different in tone but not in purpose.

Part I is an autobiographical essay by the dancer Lilian Karina, who worked in Germany in the 1920s and early 1930s, went into exile first in Hungary and then in Sweden. Her essay looks at the way dance became mixed up with racism, anti-Semitism, and then Nazism itself. She asks fundamental questions about why dance of all the main modern arts was so congenial to the Nazi leadership and why the dance community accepted censorship, the exclusion of the Jews from orchestras, ballet, and dance companies, and the ultimate horrors of Nazism without a murmur of protest. Above all, she asks whether art, however great, can justify lack of morals and integrity.

Part II is a monograph by the dance historian, Marion Kant. Dr. Kant, who danced professionally while studying at the Humboldt University in Berlin and working as an academic, writes the inner history of the relationship between the dance community and the Nazi leadership as it worked itself out in the Nazi corporate state. Her focus is on the middle bureaucracy in Dr. Joseph Goebbels' Ministry for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda, which gained absolute control of dance, opera, and theater in the 1930s, and she shows how Nazism actually worked in the arts.

Part III is a case study in Nazi culture politics and explores the ambivalence of the regime towards jazz and swing dance. There is a Documentary Appendix that will allow English-speaking readers to look at, consider, and possibly use the primary sources that underpin the other parts of this work.

The original version of the book appeared in 1996 under the title Tanz unterm Hakenkreuz. It sold out its first edition and was reprinted in an enlarged edition in 1999. The book created considerable debate and was discussed across Europe in nearly seventy reviews. The opinions expressed by the authors are controversial, and question the established accounts and tarnish the accepted images of some very great figures in the history of dance. I have tried where possible to catch the peculiar combination of ideology, bureaucratic pedantry, intrigue, inflated egoism, and sheer craziness that made Nazi dance politics in its chaos and authoritarianism so deeply characteristic of the Third Reich as a whole. In the 1920s and 1930s, German dancers rejected ballet as "foreign" (a code for Jewish) and embraced anti-modern, reactionary ideas. This continued in the 1950s and 1960s, and in exile in England, France, or the United States. While some individuals eliminated Nazi terminology and rewrote their biographies, their underlying agreement with the basic premises of the Third Reich remained.

In the 1990s, Lilian Karina, a professional dancer, and Jonathan Steinberg, a historian, collaborated to reveal the continuities in the history of German dance. Their book stirred controversy, receiving over seventy reviews in many continental European countries. However, their work was often met with hostility and dismissal, with some critics claiming that the authors were small-minded and jealous, seeking revenge.

The question arises: why has dance been treated with a conspiracy of silence? The authors argue that art always has an intimate relationship with the society that bears it, and it carries the signs and symbols of that birth into succeeding epochs. The behavior of the great creators of German modern dance shows how quickly art can be corrupted by proximity to power or wealth and how fictitious the art for art's sake actually is in practice. The paymaster calls the tune, whether it is Goebbels's Ministry of Propaganda with its dance programs or today's multinational conglomerate that will pay huge advances for works that promise not to offend the prevailing order.

Dance has a relatively marginal place in the world of serious study. We believe that this is wrong. The art of the body reveals a great deal about how physical presence, movement, and gender are understood by a given society, in a given period, and by certain artists. By the 1920s, German modern dance, as one version of the art of the body, had adopted movement concepts and formal properties that expressed values very close to the radical racism embodied in national-conservative political movements in Germany. The German Ausdruckstanz or "expressive dance" fitted the Nazi ideology very well, as it emerged from the same reactionary, cultish, racist, mystical circles that spawned many Nazis and Nazi ideas.

Why was modern dance the only "modern" genre that the Nazis welcomed? Why was it not "degenerate" as was considered most of German expressionism in the graphic arts, atonalism in music, or abstract formalism in architecture? This book tries to find some of the answers and does so across three genres: autobiographical essay, historical critique, close analysis of a case study, and a selection of documentary evidence.

The first part is Lilian Karina's memoir. She lived through the period and here shares her experiences. She remembers her colleagues and their ruined careers, when they—and she—were forced out of their profession and then out of the country. She recalls the atmosphere in Germany in the 1930s and tries to make sense of the Nazi offers and excited and passionate responses of choreographers and dancers. She constructs a personal history of modern dance and recalls what an intelligent anti-Nazi dancer saw and experienced during those terrible years and afterwards in the long decades of exile.

Part II and III are historical, analytical narratives of the politicization of German modern dance under the Nazi regime. The steps in that politicization are followed through one particular, yet immensely influential institution of the Nazi hierarchy, the Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda. Part II traces the way German modern dance cooperated with and was coopted by the regime. Part III provides a case study of the Nazi attempt to suppress jazz and swing. The history of that attempt illuminates the crazy yet murderous bureaucratic machinery that went into motion when the Nazi system dealt with the problem of the popular "swing dance."

The fourth part contains a selection of over 100 documents in which the reader can see firsthand the enthusiasm with which the dance community joined the Nazi crusade, expelled its Jewish pupils, composers, managers, and colleagues, and clambered over competitors to curry favor with its new masters. This part has been provided to introduce our readers to the source material directly and thus enable them to follow and analyze for themselves the process and consequences of Nazification in dance.

Lilian Karina was the initial force behind the German edition. She wanted to understand what happened and share her experiences in Nazi Germany, as well as learn about her findings. After she was forced to leave Germany, she first emigrated to Hungary and then to Sweden. Lilian Karina asked me to provide a section that presented and analyzed the documents in the various archives. Though we worked with the same sources and frequently discussed our research, we do not agree on all matters; the chapters are by no means identical in their evaluation of the events in Nazi Germany. They focus on different aspects of the relationship between dance and the political regime. Even if they do touch on some of the same problems, which is obvious, they place them in different contexts, provide different explanations, and lead to different conclusions. What can very clearly be seen throughout the book, though, is how seriously the Nazis took art. The collaboration between art and politics functioned to everyone’s advantage: the Nazis took over a section of society, the dance world accepted their ideology, and integrated it into their activities. The artists received a small, very small, portion of power in exchange for the favor they so warmly sought. In one of his table talks, on 25 March 1942, Hitler declared “that dance, together with music, is the primary cultural expression of a Volk”. He said, in effect, that it was through dance and music and not “through the stammering jokes of clowns and fools” that the “Volk” articulates its inner feelings, longings, hopes, and fears. This sentence alone outlines the basic Nazi policy toward dance: as the key expression of “folkish” ideology, dance was a serious matter, it was no joke, and it had to be assigned a place in the regime which would reflect its importance. If it was the medium that made visible the philosophy of the national soul, if it was the equivalent cultural and artistic expression of a political movement, then serious attention was going to have to be paid to its development. Under such circumstances it was only logical that dance be completely integrated into the regime. First, it was moved under the administrative control system of the Third Reich. Hitler entrusted dance to Goebbels, and he took good care of it. Both assumed that the art of movement provided the way to implant social and moral values into the individual; it was the means to incorporate ideological concepts. That was not new; dance has always played a unique part in society, whether it flourished or was rejected. For the Nazis dance was not only a specific reflection of the social order; it had the power to influence the invention of the new man, and become the representation of the master race. The Hitler salute—the out-stretched arm—has often been recognized as the most characteristic gesture that symbolizes Nazism. It was this physical movement that visibly converted an anonymous mass into the people’s community. This simple raising of the arm could turn a normal citizen into a follower of Nazism, for moments only or for ever after. Many modern dance artists used bodily movement to forge a similar utopian community long before the Nazi people’s community was created. Several dance communities or gymnastic groups that preceded the people’s community functioned as experimental grounds in which the actual conditioning for and subordinating to a group was practiced and tested by experience. Such groups provided the corresponding movement norms that transformed nationalism into a secular religion. Only too often did they resemble miniature versions of the later Nazi example. This book does not discuss the process by which dance communities emerged in the early twentieth century nor the attraction of these circles to "folkish" ideas. It looks at the result of this process, at the ideological fascination that led to a political system and its organizational form. The book deliberately limits itself to this side of dance's relation to Nazism.

The majority of sources used in the studies were taken from the Bundesarchiv (the Federal German Archives), at the time housed in Potsdam near Berlin, in the Berlin Document Center, just before and during the time the U.S. military force handed the material over to the German Federal Government, also files from the Geheime Staatsarchiv and microfilms from the Bundesarchiv Koblenz (the Federal German Archive in Coblenz). It contains a large collection of papers from the Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda. The files from the theater and dance departments are not complete, but substantive enough to reconstruct the history of dance turning political. In addition, many documents from theaters, opera houses, and dance archives were consulted, particularly the National Resource Centre for Dance in Guildford/England, as well as archives in Cologne, Leipzig, and Stockholm.

Twill not hear it said,

How this Work Came About
As I began to write my memoirs in 1986, I felt an urge to find out what happened to the dancers, ballet masters, and choreographers who stayed in Germany under the Nazi regime. Much of what had happened then was hard to understand. It puzzled me still, and I felt I had to search for answers. My own memories were naturally the starting point. As I tried to write down my thoughts, the outlines of those years began to emerge more precisely. They took on sharper contours.

I talked to many colleagues. Most belonged to my generation and could recall the years between 1933 and 1945 from their own experiences. I kept notes of the conversations. I wanted to test the correctness of my memories against theirs. Later I widened the circle of interviewees and talked to younger people, the generation of disciples that followed on from my colleagues.

In 1987, I learned from Jutta Wardetzky's book on theater politics in Nazi Germany that many documents that dealt with the relationship between the dance community and the Propaganda Ministry of Joseph Goebbels were housed in the State Archives in Potsdam. After what seemed an endless series of telephone calls, letters, and applications, I finally got permission in October 1987 to travel from Berlin to Potsdam. The Wall was still standing. A short rail journey seemed too much an adventure, so I took a taxi instead.

The archive was in the Soviet Military Administration building and was especially strongly guarded. The presentation of my reader's ticket soon turned into the first act of an elaborate administrative routine of military precision, which at once amused, astonished, and angered me. In any case, it took a lot of time. Finally, a woman from the archive came to collect me and accompanied me to the reading room. The material came covered in dust and tied with string. The thick folders and dusty, disorderly packets had clearly not been seen by anyone and may well have been sitting there since the Nazi period. I noticed how all the letters with marginal notes, the requests, the complaints, the accusations, the denunciations, the reviews, and the newspaper cuttings, brought the epoch to life and began to inspire me. My shadowy memories became clear and full of light; all of this because I had not taken "no" as an answer from the East-German authorities to my request to read the documents from a half-century earlier. I read about how the idols of German dance, exemplary paragons like Mary Wigman, Rudolf von Laban, and Gret Palucca, had written to the new potentates and saw the kinds of answers they received, and occasionally short marginal notes let me in on what the despotic, intriguing bureaucrats thought of them. The famous dancers were not moved by fear for their lives when they wrote. They wrote full of hope that in the new Third Reich they would have the chance at last to achieve their artistic visions. The price that they paid for this betrayal of friends, people from their circles, of their own artistic credo was clear to them. They were prepared, even eager to pay it. I could read about it in their notes, letters, memoranda, which I sought and found elsewhere. Yes, they were ready to pay a high price, and once again I call it betrayal of, treason to those humanistic values to which artists ought to feel themselves committed.

For some time I had been collecting literature from and about the period: books, articles, reviews. Time and again I was struck by the way the events after 1933 were falsely portrayed, how much was made pretty or simply omitted. In biographies and writing intended for training or education, the authors took only that part of the past that corresponded to the prevailing, acceptable view of things. Often the authors went beyond the necessary in order to adapt and submit to the desires of social order, which helped to secure the ideology of the rulers. In manuals, facts were omitted which had substantially influenced the art of dance and might have attracted attention towards certain causal connections and behavior patterns; sometimes people and their fates were simply not mentioned at all. The reasons for certain developments were obscured or falsified or recited without further investigation. In the end, I had to conclude that historiography, especially the history of dance, had in all too many cases not freed itself from the ideology of Nazism. Granted, there has been a process of democratization after the Second World War. At the same time, however, I had to concede that following those conversations the threat that arose and still arises from Nazism and racism was in no way fully recognized in its entire dreadful scope.

I am well aware of the scope of my project and have as a result limited my writing here to the activities of a few personalities in the years 1933 to 1945. I have attempted to present the general ideological principles that were on the whole accepted in the dance community, and in addition mention the prehistories of certain artistic or personal developments and explain the results of these developments. In the course of the work and the documentation, it happened that certain individuals moved to center stage: Rudolf von Laban, his protector Ministerialrat von Keudell, their critic, desk officer Cunz, his advisor Gustav Joachim Fischer-Klamt (formerly Yo Vis-cher-Klamt) and his wife Jutta Klamt, in addition to Mary Wigman and Gret Palucca, each with their followers, disciples, admirers, and denouncers. I collected copies of the documents from the archives of the GDR. Later, as I examined their content and began to work out my commentary for them, I found myself forced to write a much lengthier introduction than I had intended. I had to illuminate certain artistic developments and illustrate the links between ideological and artistic processes as well as to explain the behavior and reactions of the artists themselves.

Have Artists an Interest in Political and Social Circumstances? Many artists, dancers, choreographers and dance pedagogues deny the connection between their personal creative activity and social conditions or politics. Awareness and understanding of how their artistic activity may be profoundly affected by the society in which they live and work is not very widely spoken of. Contemporary art forms, which construct their own ideologies and publish them in manifestos, frequently declare that their work represents a closed system. Students and followers are made to accept these closed systems, as if they embodied religious truths. Political interest of artists often confines itself to the possibilities of economic support, which state or political party can afford. I have no doubt that similar attitudes prevailed in the period I am trying to describe, and that these attitudes profoundly affected the acts of the prominent creators of dance. For most of them, I think that the only thing that mattered was the pursuit of their own careers, and to that end they tailored their own numinous vision of life and their art to the ideas of the Nazis. They were in the end prepared to support the dreadful policies of fascism with their work.

I knew then and know today what happened and what it was all about. Fifty years after the event, I cannot help thinking about those who did not collaborate or were not permitted to collaborate. What happened to the victims? What happened to the dancers and choreographers who were dismissed, who had to leave Germany, their homeland, who lost work, families, and often enough their lives? Dance history says nothing about them. They have been excluded from the traditional framework of historical writing. They have simply fallen out of the categories according to which existence, and success and failure in work are measured. The way the Nazis wanted it was the way it happened. The Nazis wanted to eradicate these lives, and silence and suppression of memory did just that. What do we know about those who simply disappeared silently, who died in Auschwitz or other concentration camps, who emigrated, who somewhere somehow tried to go on living? Who asks about them today? Who remembers Sascha Leontieff, ballet master at the Vienna Opera, who was murdered in Mauthausen? Today, for the first time, I know what happened to him. Even the most famous dancers, once they left Germany, have been largely forgotten.

Lilian Karina

The history of dance has not concerned itself enough with questions about the interaction of morality and ethical responsibility. However the question may be posed, it must first be faced fully and consciously: Can artistic productivity abolish moral responsibility? Anybody who says "yes" and thinks that art has nothing to do with morality should at least not try to justify as moral the flagrant violations of human rights as Mary Wigman tried to do when she argued that it was done to save the quin-tessential "German" character of art. Equally false is the attempt to make the work of Rudolf von Laban great by turning him into a hero. The following text is OCRed from a book. Please clean it up, removing extraneous characters and separating wrongly appended words. Whenever you encounter a number, verify if it is part of a header or footer, showing a page number. These must be removed. Important: do not continue unfinished sentences. Reply ONLY with the corrected text:

It contributes nothing to the understanding of that complex, unsteady, passionate human being, who was utterly convinced of his genius. The object of this work is, therefore, to give a first view of, a very preliminary glimpse at, the development of dance as an art form in the Nazi period in Germany and to look at the actions of the artists named above. The impact of these creative dancers will not be reduced. On the contrary, the complexity of their decisions should make plain how much energy and insight is needed to arrive at an adequate assessment of their personalities and the strength of their artistic impulses. A second object of this work is to add a new subject matter to the continuous thinking about Nazi Germany. I hope to prevent the process by which misunderstanding, falsification, and legend-building take the place of exact description and analysis of documents.

The Faces of my Past

My personal experiences, the life I lived, and my contacts with teachers and friends formed my point of view and my relationship to people and events of the period. It seems important to me to name the names of those with whom I lived and worked and whose influences left an imprint on me. They are mainly people who lived through the Nazi era—as profiteers, collaborators, resistors, and as victims. At times when dictatorship limited or suppressed free expression of opinion and exchange of information in word or print, news passed from lip to lip, whispered rumors became more and more important. Like a brush fire news flitted from one person to another along well worn paths.

Evgenia Eduardova was my ballet teacher during my childhood in the 1920s in Berlin. She lived with Josef Lewitan, the founder of the magazine Der Tanz. He was a Russian Jew. Lewitan and Eduardova had to leave Germany. I was able to reconstruct their adventurous flight through the archives of the Dance Collection of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. I last saw them in 1936.

Victor Gsovsky was not only my teacher but a close friend. I owe him the unfolding of my teaching capacity. He too had to leave Germany in 1936.

Tatyana Gsovsky was very close to me. She was less as a teacher and more an artist and representative figure for the Russian avant-garde of the early years in Soviet Russia. She stayed in Germany and made a distinguished career as a choreographer.

Sascha Leontieff was ballet master of the Vienna State Opera and in 1930 my partner. Through him I got to know the main transcendental currents in modern and spiritual alternative dance forms. He was murdered in the concentration camp Mauthausen in 1942.

Egon Wiist was one of the star dancers of the El Dorado in Berlin. Like me he trained in Victor Gsovsky’s ballet in 1933. It was through him that in 1934 I got my first shocking experience of the physical brutality of Nazi concentration camps. I saw the signs of mistreatment which he got as homosexual in Dachau.

Liselotte Késter was one of Gsovsky’s best pupils. Victor saw in her the ideal embodiment of his dance style. According to her own account, confirmed by her colleagues, she was, as the prima ballerina of the Deutsche Oper Berlin, the favorite dancer of Adolf Hitler. I was close to her and visited her in the 1980s. Her views on dance and politics resembled those of many other dancers. They were marked by an absence of political awareness or insight into the situation, a preoccupation with her own success and utter indifference to the fates of other human beings—in spite of a certain curiosity about the lives of a few colleagues and friends she met. Michael Piehl was my colleague during my engagement as a soloist in Wuppertal, where I also choreographed and gave ballet instruction at the time. We became close friends and saw each other as often as circumstances permitted until his death in 1987. We wrote to each other frequently. He visited me in Stockholm several times when he was a ballet teacher at the State Ballet School in East Berlin. During the theater season 1935-36 in Wuppertal, we got to know what working in a theater under the Nazis was like. It was during that year that I made the acquaintance of Mary Wigman, who made a guest appearance with her own program, and Laban, who acted as a sort of regulator general of theatrical ballet. As a homosexual, Michael was very much in danger. In spite of that, he performed as a soloist right through the war and after 1945 became Tatyana Gsovsky's partner at the State Opera in Berlin. From 1970 on, he worked in Tatyana Gsovsky's Academy of Dance in West Berlin as a pedagogue for classical dance.

Günther Hess was ballet master during my engagement at Wuppertal. He too was threatened twice over as a homosexual and a Christian Scientist. In spite of this, he was a devoted member of the National-Socialist Party and sincerely convinced of the correctness of the Nazi ideology. At the same time, he was absolutely loyal to his dancers. I kept up my contact with him until his death in 1979 and arranged among other things guest performances for him in Stockholm at the Dramatic Theater (Dramaten), where he conducted seminars in movement pedagogy for actors and directors. He refused right up until his death to talk about the years under Hitler.

Aurél von Milloss. For three years, 1936 to 1938, we worked together in the opera in Budapest and in the Nemzéti Szinhaz, the National Theater, at different times and for different reasons. We performed in dance evenings together and with our group. I taught classical ballet and directed rehearsals for Mil-loss' choreography. We had both fled Germany. I was living at the time with a Hungarian from a Jewish background, Laszlé Vasarhelyi, whom I later married.

Gertrude Engelhart was an instructress in the Wigman school and in 1938 fled to Sweden. She told me that in Berlin she had had about ninety Swedish dancers, pedagogues, and choreographers studying dance with her, but was persecuted in Sweden in spite of that by fellow dancers, including these former students, and prevented from getting work. The excuse in those days was that one was merely protecting the job prospects of the local talent; in reality, there was a lot of support for the Nazi movement and much anti-Semitism, to which many well-known artists in Sweden had lent their support. A growing anti-Semitism had taken root in spite of the long traditions of humanist, socialist, and liberal efforts in Sweden.

Later, Trude became the first teacher of the Culberg-Cramér group, the predecessor of the Cullberg Baletten. Trude taught lay people the elements of modern dance in my dance studio, which I founded in 1944.

Birgit Cullberg was from 1939 on and during the war both my moral support and my confidante in Sweden. For fifteen years, she was one of the most devoted pupils in my ballet studio. One of her dance evenings awakened new hope in me, for in it, I saw a dancer who recognized the danger of National Socialism and gave that danger expression in dance. An antifascist and pacifist, Birgit Cullberg brilliantly embodied Swedish humanism. She knew how to give her dance drama an inner greatness. She followed the precepts of her teacher Kurt Jooss and created, in the almost naive simplicity of her expressive dancing, possibly the most powerful dance dramas of the modern era. In so doing, she defied the risks that the German occupation of Denmark and Norway represented for neutral Sweden throughout the war.

Birgit was a member of the Clarté, the association of artists and intellectuals founded by Henri Barbusse in 1919, which called for a struggle against war and fascism. Extinguished in France, the group of Clarté lived on in Sweden. She belonged among the most prominent personalities who opposed the expulsion of German refugees by the Swedish authorities.

Edgar Frank was a famous soloist at the Deutsche Oper, the German Opera, in Berlin. He too was Jewish and left Germany, but only after being urged to do so by Kurt Jooss. For a while, he taught in my dance studio in Stockholm. With Edgar, as with Trude, I had only a limited acquaintance, but their fates interested me.

In 1987, I began to look in the Riksarchiv in Stockholm for documents about them.

* Introduction 9

Bea Zoltana was initially a dancer, and later on a pedagogue, and was well known under the name Bea Lajtai. In 1940, she fled from Denmark to Sweden with her husband, the operetta composer Lajos Lajtai. Both were Jewish. Albert Gaubier was also a Jewish refugee. He tried to work in Stockholm as a dancer and choreographer. Gaubier and Bea Lajtai became close friends. They were active politically and drawn by the events of those years ever more deeply into the dance of death of the Nazi period.

After the war, I was able to be in contact with the following people: Gerda Renon, my colleague from the Eduardova school. She was a friend from my youth. After her ballet education, she danced in several groups and became a soloist at the Munich Opera. She married the Jewish pharmacist Manfred Aberle. In 1935, she divorced him in order not to lose her work. She left her daughter Viola, born in 1935, who, according to the Nuremberg Laws, was a "Mischling" [a half-Jew - JS], in the care of her fragile old mother. As a "Rassenschander" [a racial polluter - JS] Aberle was sent to the concentration camp Dachau. Swedish relatives bought him out and got him to Stockholm in 1936. In 1948, Gerda Renon came to Stockholm with her daughter. She had passed the previous years in great hardship and had only managed to feed her family by indulging in nightly black market deals. She told me a great deal about the dark years under the Nazis. Her daughter Viola became my pupil and later a highly regarded member of the opera ballet company in Stockholm. Today she is a well-known film director.

Herta Wegeleben also arrived in Stockholm in 1948, together with her four-year-old son, through the intervention of some relatives. She had begun her training in the Klamt school and continued it with the two Gsovskys. After that, she was a solo dancer at the Volksoper Berlin, the Theater des Westens, and had gone through the war there. After the war, she fell ill with a bad case of tuberculosis and after a lengthy cure in Davos, she tried very hard to regain her ability to work in her profession. She was first a student in my school and later a recognized teacher, especially for children's dance and the training of young people and amateur dancers. Herta knew Palucca and Fischer-Klamt well since she had been a soloist in the Klamt Group. I owe a great deal of knowledge to her about the conditions in opera houses and ballet companies under the Nazis. She described the bombing attacks and the state of the theaters, including their closure in the last weeks of the war, the forced labor in industry, etc. She also shared her acquaintance with Gret Palucca, with whom she shared a great friendship for many years. Although they talked for hours in great intimacy about personal and artistic things, Palucca maintained absolute silence about her career in the Third Reich. The only exception was her moving account of the bombing of Dresden in 1945, which she narrowly survived.

Lilian Karina Hilde Buchwald, Herta Wegeleben's sister, was also a Klamt pupil and a pianist. She had contact with many dance schools in Berlin and observed their work, teaching methods, and behavior towards the holders of power. She was utterly opposed to National Socialism and was briefly arrested for harboring a deserter. She owed her life to the chaotic conditions in the last months of the war. After the war, she made a name for herself through her movement techniques, which she taught to actors and described in a book. She had great success with her courses on movement technique for actors in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Switzerland.

Ingeborg Klamt, the daughter of Jutta Klamt and Gustav-Joachim Fischer-Klamt, could tell about her father's working relationship to Cunz. She was ten years old in 1936 when the Dance Yearbook 1937 was written in the family's Berlin apartment. After the war, she moved to Aarau in Switzerland and has lived there for many years. She carried on the school for artistic dance founded by her mother with great success.

Sonja Sundberg was one of the Swedish stage artists who worked on the German stage right through the entire war until 1944. She danced as a soloist in Gera and Essen. She was a trained Dorothee Giinther pupil. Carl Orff, who was the musical director at the Giinther school, strongly influenced her style. Despite her lack of political awareness and responsibility, she could tell many interesting things about how Orff, Giinther, Maja Lex, and above all the family of the Vice President and later President of the Reich Theater Chamber, Ludwig Korner, had behaved in the Nazi era. Sundberg knew Laban as well, whom she had met in Manchester.

Bengt Hager worked with Rolf de Maré in his Archives de la Danse in Paris. He was the founder of the Dansemuseet in Stockholm, the Carina Ani Library, and Rec- tor of the Choreographic Institute in Stockholm, later the University School of Dance. As a friend of Kurt Jooss, he administered a great portion of the Jooss archive and the Jooss collection. He is one of my dearest and closest friends and has had a profound influence on my attitude toward the problems of our time and the way that I evaluate my experiences. In many conversations, he has deepened my insights and supported my research work in every way, including economic support through bursaries from the Carina Ari Foundation.

CHAPTER | A Historical Overview of the Labanist Period
Pre-Labanism: the Rise of the Culture of the Body (1900s-1920s)
A short historical overview will help to understand the situation of dance before the Nazi seizure of power in 1933 and following 1945, the end of the Second World War. A division along the lines of Rudolf von Laban's career seems to me to be justified, for through it, we can discern, on the one hand, the various developmental phases of the so-called Ausdruchstanz [expressive dance — JS], which were fundamentally influenced by him and, on the other hand, the inter-relationship between modern dance and one of its iconic figures with respect to the power structures and Nazi ideology. The relationship between Laban and the newly founded Propaganda Ministry of Joseph Goebbels is of particular interest, as it led to the appeal for modern dance to be elevated in rank among the performing arts. This resulted in the claim for dance to have its own theater and its own higher school of dance.

The period before Laban's arrival on the scene, from the beginning of the twentieth century to the 1920s, was marked by various efforts to renew dance and the art of movement, music education, gymnastics, and pedagogy in the broadest sense. These efforts included the eurhythmic movement, developed by Rudolf Steiner through anthroposophy, and the growing interest in promoting the body and body culture, which had evolved during the nineteenth century.

Delsartism®, which originated in the U.S.A., was transmitted to Europe by Delsarte's pupil McKaye and then by Geneviéve Stebbins, who wrote the method down and preserved it for posterity. Ted Shawn later led the movement. Isadora Duncan and her sister Elizabeth followed in their footsteps. Isadora went on to become the absolute symbol for renewal of the art of dance. They founded dance schools to propagate their worldview and understanding of body culture and the art of movement.

Bess Mensendieck came from the U.S.A. and influenced the doctrine of body culture, particularly for women, and tried to develop a therapy based on consciously controlled and trained dancelike movements. One of her successors was Hedwig Kallmayer. Many of Mensendieck and Kallmayer's pupils turned to artistic dance. The Swiss Emile Jaques-Dalcroze tried to achieve a translation of music into movement. Many of those who later became Laban's disciples, including Mary Wigman, came from his school in Hellerau near Dresden. He created one of the earliest groups that performed at their own expense.

Rudolf Steiner, the founder of a spiritual movement called anthroposophy, influenced avant-garde painting and sculpture with his doctrines on color and form. The eurhythmics he created had primarily therapeutic purposes. Steiner's group appeared in their own dance concerts in the 1920s, staking their claim to be included in the modern dance scene. Even today, Waldorf schools carrying on Steiner's anthroposophical ideas work out their own dances, which they also perform.

Rudolf von Laban, Rudolf Bode, and Medau started from these premises and sought new ways to develop bodily awareness and to renew the art of dance. Trance dancing, another phenomenon of the new century, was taken seriously, even by critics. Alfred Kerr and his writings on the trance dancer Madeleine come to mind. Sascha Leontieff, the ballet master of the Vienna Opera, appeared before invited audiences and demonstrated his astonishing clairvoyant powers after his dance performances. In 1930, the author danced as his partner at such events.

Nudism, the culture of the naked body, a consequence of the new feeling for the body, played a smaller role on the stage. However, for years there were recitals of art dances performed entirely naked. Also in those years, there existed a pseudo-exoticism, as Asian and African traditions were converted into stylized dances to meet the European taste and were turned into magical artistic forms of expression. A certain parallelism could be found in the way romanticism took up and misunderstood Hellenism or other cultures like the Assyrian or Egyptian ones. Such pseudo-exotic dances with their yearning for India, Greece, or Egypt and their overlay of occultism drawn from a variety of sources found a counterpart in the so-called national dances with their folkloric ambitions.

A very different impact on the development of modern dance came from Serge Diaghileff, the brilliant impresario and founder of the Ballets Russes de Diaghileff. He was able to achieve a significant renewal in ballet by engaging a series of artists who arrived at an entirely new conception of music, choreography, thematic shaping, and scene setting. The great abilities of the Russian dancers blossomed in works by Mikhail Fokine and later Vaclav Nijinsky and Bronislava Nijinska. These artists could not only dazzle audiences with complicated variations and pas de deux's but at the same time managed to burst the bounds of the art form in all sorts of ways. Their expressive power grew out of their effort to bring the peculiar magic of Russian symbols and forms of expression, deeply rooted in folk traditions with all their inexplicable strength, to a high artistic form and to translate them for the public of the European stage.

The impulse to renew Russian stage dance came in the highest degree from music. Alexander P. Borodin, Modest Mussorgsky, Nikolai A. Rimsky-Korsakov, and Igor Stravinsky opened with their compositions the possibility of rev-olutionizing dance forms, dance movements, choreography, costumes, and scenery, attracting visual artists like Bakst, Benois, Gontcharova, and later Picasso and other modern visual artists. The period was also marked by efforts to find a way back to the original roots of peasant life, their culture, and art. Béla Bart6k and Zoltan Kodaly initiated this attempt to renew and reform the expressiveness of music.

Finally, jazz, coming from the U.S.A., influenced social dancing as well as stage dance and the avant-garde in painting and sculpture. Progressive young people, above all from bourgeois backgrounds, found in the Afro-American rhythms of jazz a way to express their ecstatic yearnings, which traditional culture denied them and which seemed to be disappearing in modern society.

The Era of Labanism at its Peak: the Development of "New Dance," Modern and Stage Dance (1920s-1937)

The great representatives of the new directions of dance, Rudolf von Laban and also Mary Wigman and their pupils and disciples, who later went along their own paths developed modern dance as an art and style in the 1920s. Changes took place in every branch of dance: dance pedagogy, children's dance, dance therapy, the so-called artistic lay dance, concert or podium dance, chamber dance, and, it must not be forgotten, in the field of ballet in the great opera houses. Russia's influence on the dance culture of central Europe and on Labanism is not to be underestimated. It came with the wave of Russian refugees who gradually fled from the Russian Revolution of 1917. The level expected in the Russian schools was higher than the standard in the German schools, and so parallel to the growth of schools of expressive dance, in Germany the Russians brought new impulses to the techniques of traditional ballet schools. This double process began immediately after the end of the First World War in 1918. The "new dance" in all its variations and with all its weaknesses—from lay dancing to dance as a method of healing—thus engendered a revolution in stage dance. Its breadth and depth were not at first perceivable: gymnastics was completely renewed; attention was directed to the creative forces in children of both dance and the art of movement; the dogmatic training of ballet dancers was loosened; the composition of traditional ballet works broke free. Mikhail Fokine had already criticized and condemned the sterility of traditional ballet. Traditional compositional models had customarily to accept the role of musical structure as framework. It had become distant from the logic of its own thematic movement connection and presented nothing more than opportunities for virtuoso technical performances such as variations, pas de deux, and groupings.

Lilian Karina Laban's students and successors had a tremendous influence on opera ballet across the many opera houses, which had been court, city or provincial theaters before 1914. Even smallish cities like Gera, Miinster, Hameln, etc. had theaters that combined drama, opera, and ballet under one roof and one administration. Sometimes the ballet groups had no more than six or seven dancers, and the ballet master was often forced to act as soloist, training master, and choreographer at the same time. Sometimes ordinary dancers had to carry out these tasks. Before the emergence of "new dance," this limited the development of ballet on the traditions of classical ballet: dance episodes in opera, management of crowds of extras, and in rare cases a few opportunities for soloists.

The representatives of the new wave, Labanists like Kurt Jooss, Aurél von Milloss, Julian Algo, broke radically with these traditions. Many difficulties arose in the early stages, and those not willing to adapt were dismissed as we shall see. Nevertheless, the Labanists carried out the decisive step. They created a dance art form that wanted to be recognized as independent, even within the theater.

A number of schools from other currents in the "new artistic dance" can also be mentioned here again: Jaques-Delcroze's school of Hellerau-Laxenburg, the Lohe-land school, Steiner's eurhythmia, Bess Mensendieck's and Hedwig Kallmayer's schools, the Klamt school, the Orff-Giinther school, the schools of the Duncan sisters, the Gertrud Bodenwieser school, not to mention Rosalie Chladek's in Vienna, and Suzanne Perrottet's in Switzerland, among others. All were significant institutions with many pupils and all gained interested audiences. But the most significant individual in the process of revolutionizing dance was Laban.

Laban's appointment as director of ballet at the Staatsoper in Berlin aroused great expectations and was widely welcomed in the press and on the radio. The critic Josef Lewitan wrote in the May 1930 issue of Der Tanz an article entitled: "Habe-mus Papam" [We have a Pope — JS]. Yet in spite of a few great successes, such as the new choreography for the Polovtsian dances from Borodin's opera Knight Igor and the Venusberg in Richard Wagner's Tannhduser, Laban's years of work at the State Opera from 1931 to 1934 were a disappointment for him and for the dancers. Laban knew that he had failed and blamed his bad relationship with the director of the opera, Tietjen, for his lack of success. Laban described this in a letter to Frau Lieschke dated 3 September 1937, when he stated "that dwarf Tietjen was in my opinion ... never a fully paid up human being." In addition, there were conflicts between Laban and the ballet ensemble, which I shall illuminate below. The conflict that obstructed Laban's work and the realization of his radical reforms consisted of the following elements: First, Laban decided to dismiss Victor Gsovsky as ballet master, who was very highly valued by the ballerinas Dorotea Albu and Genia Nikolayeva who had recommended him, and by Max Terpis who admired him. Laban's decision to fire Gsovsky in December 1929, with effect at the end of the season in 1930, was simply based on the fact that he was a "ballet" person and hence a rival. But Laban and the press underestimated the effect the dismissal would have. Nobody could have foreseen that Victor and Tatyana Gsovsky would become the core of a group hostile to both Laban and Wigman. Second, Laban dismissed the soloists, the ballerinas Dorotea Albu, Daisy Spiess, and Genia Nikolayeva and the male dancers Rudolf Kélling, Walter Junk, and Jens Keith for the same reason – they belonged to the ballet camp and not his own modern dance camp. This release was confirmed by Laban on 9 April 1930 and made final on 18 June 1931.

The dismissed dancers, "the State Opera Six," managed to generate much publicity in a scandal-loving press. They had the advantage of a very popular and well-established repertoire and enjoyed much affection. Third, the ballet direction decided to abolish the contractual status of soloists. Fourth, there was the question of dancing bare-foot: it was quickly clear that many barefoot dances, which Laban favored, were simply incompatible with point technique. Lizzie Maudrick, ballet mistress and choreographer, had given traditional point dancing a new modern actuality at the State Opera. She stayed at the State Opera.

Gsovsky left the State Opera without a murmur. His position as instructor there had never been entirely satisfactory, but it had made him famous well beyond the professional dance circles in Berlin. He had every opportunity to open a private ballet school and secure his standard of living. The best dancers in the State Opera, later the Deutsche Oper, still continued to study with him, such as Daisy Spiess, Dorotea Albu, Genia Nikolayeva, Jens Keith, Rudolf Kélling and, as the youngest, Liselotte Késter. Many of them were later to have great influence on dance in Berlin and all of Germany. Although some were in fact Laban pupils, they all contributed to his fall – with the support of higher authorities. In 1943 Kélling became the director of the Berlin dance school, which Laban had founded.

Some additional elements in Laban's failure at the State Opera should be mentioned. He was, in the end, not capable of reconciling tradition and innovation in a way that could work within the framework of a state theater. There was a gulf between his and Wigman's revolution in the art of dance and the justly condemned old-fashioned habits of the ballet company at the State Opera with its choreographic stereotypes. He never found the entrée into that culture and created no way to mediate between them. I want to be careful not to fall into the clichés of a conflict between "classical" and "modern" dance. However, Laban did in fact revolutionize the State Opera in 1930 by overthrowing the traditional ballet ensemble of a prima ballerina, ballerinas, coryphées and their male counter-parts plus a corps de ballet. The Prussian ballet tradition had been broken. The work of Max Terpis as ballet master had already undermined the remnants of that tradition even before Laban's arrival on the scene. The explosion of the new dance had already reached the great theaters. Ballet master Kréller had introduced innovations, which Terpis had continued. Most of the soloists were either Laban pupils or products of other modern schools. The older bal- 16 Lilian Karina let soloists like, for example, Margarete Altmann, who came from the Zorn-Freising school and represented Krdller’s style, were about to retire. Hence when Laban took over the ballet company, it was certainly not exclusively classical in its training. At the same time, the private ballet schools of the most varied techniques and types were flourishing in Berlin. They represented the full variety of classical styles and ballet teaching methods, notably Margarete Altmann's school in the Schénhauser Allee, Eduardova's St. Petersburg school, or the Moscow studio of Catherine Devillier. These two latter represented the Russian styles as practiced in the former case at the Maryinsky Theater and the latter at the Bolshoi. Finally, there was the much more modern Russian school of Victor Gsovsky, which was a kind of Russian avant-garde ballet approach.

In 1933, the Nazis came to power and in the great book-burning events showed their true barbaric approach to culture. Laban ignored all that and took steps to realize his grand plans. He made an application to the office of the Intendant for Prussian theaters to have an archive created to be attached to the State Opera. The archive was dedicated to the introduction of Laban's system of dance notation, which was then still in its early stages. In addition, he demanded the establishment of an archive for film. In the dance archive in Leipzig, I found Laban's handwritten sketches for a radical transformation of dance instruction at the State Opera, which actually amounted to a final liquidation and eradication of the traditional ballet schools.

Apparently, Laban wanted to show his loyalty to the Third Reich and its ideals in a letter, which now has such an incriminating content. The handwritten note on the copy reads: "removed from a folder where it had been misfiled." The letter from Laban as ballet director to the General Intendant of the State Theaters in Berlin, dated 7 July 1933 reads: "The B.D. [ballet director — JS] has removed all non-Aryan pupils from the children's course effective the end of the season. End of season: 7 July 1934. Attached please find the new pupil register." "Removed" means, of course, dismissed. Laban was over-eager, as it was not until 1938 that non-Aryan, Jewish children were required to be removed from school instruction. The fact that the document has survived by an error is significant. My experience has been that such damaging evidence has been frequently removed from personal files. They are, we are told, no longer available, although archive registers and indices continue to list them. Laban's readiness, and that of many other important dance artists, to accept the anti-Semitism of the new regime as fast as they could makes later excuses of ignorance impossible. The bits of evidence that survive speak a very different language. As far as Laban is concerned, his letter to the General Intendant of the Prussian State Theaters about the removal of non-Aryans from the children's courses is an undeniable sign of his eagerness to join the Nazi regime. Six months later, he ordered the Aryanization of the entire ballet school. Wigman behaved in exactly the same way. Years later, Jewish friends and acquaintances of Laban and Wigman would continue to assert that they had not behaved like anti-Semites. Why did they, the victims, also show such devotion? A Historical Overview of the Labanist Period Goebbels. It was not long before he had become the leading personality in artistic dance in the Third Reich. Fritz Béhme described this situation: "If Laban is in contact with you, then everything will be just fine, because, as I see it, he seems to have become the responsible man for the entire creative programming for German dance in general." The 1934 dance festival programs represented Laban's work. They took place at the Theater am Horst-Wessel-Platz, the new Nazi name for the Volkstheater, the Folk Theater of Erwin Piscator. Laban wrote the first section of the program notes and gave a very clear indication of his plans related to and his attitude toward the Nazi regime. In the following years, he declared his closeness to Nazi ideology again and again. He emphasized the "German" in dance; on every occasion, he displayed his anti-democratic attitudes. He advocated the Führer principle [absolute obedience to the person of the leader — JS], which he saw embodied in Adolf Hitler: "We want to place our means of expression and the language of our art at its most intense in the service of the great tasks, which our people [Volk in the original — JS] must accomplish and to which our Führer has pointed the way with implacable clarity of vision." Through the Reich Culture Chamber, he believed, there was now the possibility of founding a German Dance Theater, as the home base of German artistic dance, the fulfillment of the dream he had cherished for a decade or more. The time of congresses and blather was over, as was the era of chaotic and contrasting performances without criteria. There would be no more dance parliaments but festivals of German dance art.

A letter from Kurt Jooss to his teacher Laban, dated 17 October 1928, illustrates Laban's plans, above all his relationship to his colleagues and the constant bitter rivalry between him and Wigman. The "interesting things" from Berlin refer to the position at the State Opera: "In the meantime, four weeks have passed, and we are in the midst of our work. One rejection follows another. From colleagues, I hear all sorts of interesting things from Berlin and would be glad to hear from you what is really going on and what is just gossip. We have had a big clash with Kestenberg, when he told us that the state was now supporting Wigman, that by underwriting her group they are moving towards the long-cherished idea of a state dance theater. Schulz-Dübg and I spoke rather sharply to him and said that there could be no question of supporting Wigman and leaving you out in the cold once again. To all that he replied 'what do you want from me? Laban comes up with one suggestion after another. No ministry can deal with that.'" The excerpt shows how embattled the dance scene of that era was and how the dancers worked against each other. Laban and Wigman were the two big personalities of Weimar German Dance, and it is understandable that in the following years they should continue to try to consolidate their positions under the Nazis. A training camp for dancers was set up in Rangsdorf in the summer of 1935 by the Reich Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda, and Laban was made its director. There he attempted to convince the dance community of the importance of the ideology of National Socialism and to place them firmly under the direct control of the Propaganda Ministry. The dancers in the State Opera who enjoyed the protection of Reich Marshall Hermann Goring felt safer there than in Laban's scheme. They dared to refuse to attend the course. Not only that, they let it be known in a newspaper report. According to a handwritten note on the text Lizzie Maudrick, ballet mistress, composed the statement and the General Intendant approved it. It was printed in the daily Berlin newspaper Jageblatt on 28 August 1935: "The General Intendant of the Prussian State Theater asks us to communicate that members of his ballet group have not taken part in the training camp at Rangsdorf. Further training of the ballet group rests according to a general and comprehensive new set of regulations exclusively in the hands of the senior choreographic direction of the Prussian State Theaters."

Laban's last choral work, "Of the Warm Wind and New Joy," was supposed to introduce the Olympic games. After the dress rehearsal, Goebbels ordered that it be canceled. According to numerous reports from witnesses and some later historiography, Goebbels' decision to cancel the work proves that Laban was an anti-Nazi. It was supposed, it is claimed, that he was a "pacifist" or a "socialist." The Laban devotee Lisa Ullmann claimed that Rudolf von Laban went to England and France after he had fallen out of favor with the Nazi regime in 1936. According to her, Laban worked as a free lance artist in Berlin and other cities. Although that is today the general understanding, it is simply factually false. All these accounts, which claim to demonstrate by evidence, do not tell the truth. Laban received a proper contract from the Propaganda Ministry and was their employee until 1937.

Laban's correspondence with desk officer Cunz shows how and why he was relieved of the direction of the Master Workshops. Laban fell ill and begged Cunz to be allowed, in spite of his illness, to plan the next stages of the Master Workshops. He wanted to keep his post at all costs. The letter from Rudolf von Laban to Rolf Cunz, written from the Sanatorium Schloss Horneck in Gundelsheim a.N. (Württemberg) dated 23 September 1936 demonstrates his utter devotion to the Nazi State and his eagerness to continue to work for the Goebbels administration.

"You can easily imagine how hard I find it to stand aside or more accurately to lie in bed during the beginning of the realization of one of the most important tasks for German dance. ... So I have decided to submit to the Ministry the medical certificate together with a request to prolong my leave of absence. I do not want to neglect to thank you for your recent friendly lines and to tell you how pleased I am that you have committed yourself—with or without me—to the work of schooling for master and other dance pupils more or less competently begun by me. We have to carry on and it must become a great and exemplary affair. A Historical Overview of the Labanist Period 19

In what way, how or how much I can help in that endeavor is today difficult to assess. At any rate I hope to be in Berlin soon in some sort of consultative capacity. Until then, as has been planned from the first moment, I have ordered the completion of the previous well-tried planned hourly program of study. One will have first to know the type and number of pupils before new dispositions can be considered. Please forgive me for writing with a pencil as I lie here, but sitting is difficult for long periods. With every good wishes and best greetings to your wife and to you, Heil Hitler! Always yours (signed) Laban

Laban was passionately involved in the establishment of the Master Workshops. Laban's dream of establishing a Higher Institute of Dance seemed feasible, given the fusion of tradition and revolution in dance. Laban's incapacity was proven with medical certificates, and he was offered a contract as a consultant. Laban was satisfied with the remuneration and thanked the authorities for their approval. On August 14, 1936, Laban submitted a proposal to grant the newly founded Master Workshops the status and function of a Hochschule. However, the idea was deemed premature.

Laban's plans were ambitious, but he faced opposition from bureaucrats and dance artists. The Dance Section of the Reich Theater Chamber needed Laban as a consultant, but accusations against him and his closest collaborators began to accumulate. Laban was deemed unreliable in the administration of state funds, and his incapability in managing a substantial budget was evident. His downfall was attributed to his dependence on devoted women who lacked management skills. In fact, Laban despised every form of bureaucracy. He considered himself above petty considerations and procedures. He dwelt in higher regions of the world of thought. He was the genius who was lifted beyond normal constraints. None of this prevented him from grasping that there were failings in his organizational work. In the 1930s, he often wrote to Suzanne Perrottet. In such letters, Laban swung back and forth between his contempt for bureaucracy and his awareness that bureaucracy was the only means to fulfill his dreams. He saw the dilemma clearly. As early as 1928, he had written: “There has to be a Higher Institute of Dance in Germany and all these German organizations ... I have to accept all these silly organizations, because they will bring me money.” And in 1929, he wrote: “... Now I am feeling miserable. My dance theater has scattered to the four corners of the world and I am all alone in Hamburg ... I am famous like few others are but somehow too dumb and gypsy-ish to raise money.”²

A variety of unexpected difficulties began to plague Laban’s “freelance” work. It was not only the threatening bureaucracy. Now there were complaints about his work and his behavior. Modern dance had developed freely, without committees, minutes and resolutions. Its dynamism arose from this freedom, and to the suggestive charisma, which he radiated. It seems to me that neither Laban, nor Wigman, nor even Palucca knew about the threatening letters, nor the denunciations. Laban was certainly unaware of the duplicity of the ministerial civil servants with whom he dealt, who covered up such threats and denunciations with ironic marginalia. He may have had a suspicion, evidence of which can be seen in his “farewell letter” [my name — LK] to Marie-Luise Lieschke.²

Opposition to Labanism: Realistic Dance Theater

In the years following the First World War, other new currents, which came from futurist, surrealist or dadaist impulses as well as political cabaret, found their way into the material that was giving dance a new substance. Valeska Gert and Anita Berber represented the extreme poles of dadaist dance. Valeska Gert’s style was all about satires and the revolutionary social criticism, which the dada artists advocated. She was an immensely political dancer and strictly opposed to Mary Wigman’s and Laban’s theories, as can be seen in her articles and books.² Anita Berber, photo model and movie star, was originally a dancer. She achieved recognition and respect in the radical art scene through her performances in the most daring of sex education films.³ Going as far as sadomasochism, Anita Berber personified in her art and life a protest against the existing society, a protest which dada carried out through satire.²

Although these tendencies gradually turned into perversions in the later 1920s, their basis in social protest was never lost for me and for other attentive observers. During the second half of the 1920s, many creative artists turned towards a new realism, generally known as Die neue Sachlichkeit [the new matter-of-factness — JS]. It is within this new realism that I see both the development of the lay-dance movement and the creation of realistic dance theater. Representatives of this course were dancers like Jean Weidt, who later became famous as the “red dancer.”² Weidt had been influenced by Laban indirectly through his teacher Sigurd Leeder, but where Laban created mass movement choirs, Weidt and others turned them into “red groups” of the workers’ movement.

Laban's idea was thus put to a purpose very far from the original. Kurt Jooss became famous in 1932 when his Green Table, an anti-war dance drama, won the first prize in the International Choreographic Competition in Paris. His work generated great excitement by the burning actuality of its theme and the limitation of choreographic devices, which gave the piece its shattering impact. Those were years in which the threat of war lay like distant thunder in the air.

CHAPTER 2 Art and Culture under National Socialism
The New Legislation
There was never any secret about the aims and intentions of the National Socialists, their ideas on art and culture, the directives that they sought to promulgate or the means they intended to use to get their way. One can assume that leading personalities in the dance world like Rudolf von Laban would have read Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf, in which Hitler makes no secret of his dreadful ambitions. Before 1933 one could hardly avoid having knowledge of the proclamations of hate, which the Nazi press shamelessly spread.

Once the Nazis seized power, the intentions were realized one by one. They were ordered by Hitler, carried out in the realm of culture and art by Joseph Goebbels, and hastened along by the constant struggle for power among competing great and middling satraps of the regime from Herman Goring through Alfred Rosenberg and Robert Ley to Julius Streicher. They each added a special twist to the general Nazi declaration of faith.

Part of the development of dance was directly and immediately affected by the new legislation, which covered all theaters, training places for dance, and all "free" groups. There are many documents lying in the archives that shed light on certain events. The newly promulgated laws were well known to all the leaders and prominent artists in the dance world because copies were systematically distributed to each of them. It was up to them to carry these directives out and to arrange for the corresponding measures.

Weeks after the first Nazi pogrom, "spontaneously" staged by the S.A., against the Jews in April 1933, the "Law for the Re-establishment of the Professional Civil Service" was promulgated. This decree institutionalized and sanctioned state brutality against Jews. It was the first of a series of laws that systematically excluded Jews from the "Aryan community" and was ultimately meant to destroy all persons who thought, felt or acted differently, looked different, belonged to the wrong religions, were politically undesirable, and so on.

Art and Culture under National Socialism
23
On 22 September 1933, the Reich Culture Chamber of the Reich Ministry for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda was set up.² The Reich Theater Chamber (RTC) was one of its sections. The Reich Dramaturge, Eugen Klépfer, was appointed president. The dance community was divided into those professional dancers who worked on the stage, that is in theaters (Fachschaft Bühne), and those free creative dancers, dance pedagogues, directors of movement choirs and the like (Fachschaft Tanz). The German Dance Yearbook, published in 1937 by Cunz and Fischer-Klamt through the Dorn-Verlag, Berlin, describes the new system as follows:

VI. Dance within the Reich Theater Chamber: The Reich Theater Chamber administers with exclusive competence all dancers and dance affairs including lay dance and physical dance training. It cares for the training of the young and regulates admission to the professions of dancer and dance teacher. The following text is OCRed from a book.

It supervises all institutions of dance instruction, administers examinations and tests, determines the methods of examination and establishes the regulations governing school and teaching. The exercise of instructional and any other professional activity in the field of artistic dance, movement choirs and all other artistic enterprise in dance requires membership in the Reich Theater Chamber by joining “The German Choral Singer and Dance League, e.V. [registered society — JS] (now Fachschaft Tanz, Professional Group 1) as the competent and relevant professional association. Everybody working in dance received these directives. The 1937 German Dance Yearbook 1937 is of particular interest since it lays out some of the principles applied to art and culture under the Goebbels ministry. The intention of the Goebbels ministry was without any doubt to tailor every aspect of cultural expression to the views of the Third Reich. The presidents of the different sections, the Minis-terial senior civil servants, and the desk officers had all been members of the party for a long time or had early on showed that they were sympathizers. They protected and promoted those prominent in the arts who suited their tastes and ideology. The patron-client relationship between von Keudell and Laban is a perfect example of mutual support. In the majority of cases the protected and favored artists showed an almost athletic flexibility in adapting their ideas to those desired by the Nazis, even if before 1933 they had shown little or no interest. A comfortable and extremely com-mon way of securing their careers without manifesting the degree of compromise was to say, “oh well, it’s not really that bad anyway.” This feeble excuse and a vague hope for change enabled many artists to accept the most appalling atrocities, some of which happened on the streets before their very eyes. In a nutshell, the various cultural fields looked as such: Literature and Press: Goebbels controlled the press and every other form of literature right from the start. Censorship was harsh. Many writers, journalists and editors ended in concentration camps or in exile. Book burning was common in 1933 to demonstrate both symbolically and literally that literary and scientific writing that failed to fit the National-Socialist worldview was to be destroyed. 24 Lilian Karina Film: Goebbels recognized the enormous importance of film in influencing and indoctrinating the masses, and exploited it ruthlessly. His censors determined down to the smallest detail what could be shown in each film. The UFA film studio [Uni-versum Film Aktiengesellschaft—Germany’s biggest film company — JS] became Goebbels’s special instrument in this process. Radio: For the first time in the history of radio, cheap receivers, the Volksempfanger [the people’s radio —JS] became an instrument of rule. Advanced technology made this possible. Of course, Mussolini had pioneered this technique on a much smaller scale during the Ethiopian campaign of 1935. Painting and Sculpture: The “beaux arts” were thoroughly bent to suit the Nazi program. The great art exhibition in Munich and the “degenerate art” exposition of 1937 showed quite clearly the method and selection of desired and undesirable art. In painting and sculpture Hitler’s tastes and preferences played a great role. Architecture: Even more prominently than in the visual arts the search for the super-sized and megalomaniac found expression in architecture. Gigantic edifices were supposed to symbolize the durability of the Thousand Year Reich, which was fated to be a world empire. Hitler's passion for classical antiquity determined this predominant choice of style.

Theater: In this field, the same rules as for press and literature applied. Contemporary works were easily classified into acceptable and unacceptable. The classic posed a much more subtle and complicated problem, in spite of which some famous works were simply banned and others shortened. The authorities even tried to eliminate silences and other passages that might give rise to misunderstandings. Certain monologues were eliminated altogether, and certain emphases ruled out. As relatively easy as it was to burn a book, it was much harder to prevent its private ownership. In the end, the Nazis could never completely eliminate the heritage of classical humanism or bend it to the demands of National-Socialist ideology.

Music, concerts, opera: all Jewish and non-Aryan composers were stricken from the repertoire, and the works of all "left-wing," socialist or communist artists were forbidden. Avant-garde works, which strove for new or unconventional effects, were branded "cultural bolshevism" and condemned. In spite of all that, there were composers who refused to fit themselves into the acceptable categories and survived. Until 1938 at least, music was less tightly regulated than the other arts.

Dance: The Nazi years began with great uncertainty about what was or was not acceptable. With the exception of the "Jewish question" and the exclusion of the left, there was no clear direction about how modern and classic dance were to be understood. The representatives of modern dance did not simply adapt themselves to the ruling Nazi ideology; they began by assuming that their modern dance was by its nature an expression of Nazi ideas. Goebbels could, therefore, afford to be tolerant in his dealings with dance and simply wait for the battles among the various currents in dance and dance pedagogy to be fought out. In the dance world, censorship really hinged on self-censorship of themes and of styles of movement within the dance world itself.

The possibilities of development and the plans for reorganization of the entire dance community had already begun to be worked out and fought over in the 1920s. A bit of background information helps to understand how these plans were realized and ultimately went terribly wrong: the power that Joseph Goebbels exercised over all decisive questions was absolute, but the choice of personnel and substantive issues that came to his attention depended, as in all bureaucracies, on the choices and decisions made by his subordinates. They advocated various directions and favored various artists and fiercely rejected others. Besides, the Propaganda Ministry had to fend off competitors. Alfred Rosenberg, author of Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts (The Myth of the Twentieth Century), which along with Mein Kampf expressed the core of Nazi ideology, directed an office for racial politics and meddled in cultural matters. Although Goebbels had to push him to one side, Rosenberg never missed an opportunity to try to regain his primacy as chief ideologue of the regime. The Gestapo played a special role. Goebbels enjoyed certain police powers in his ministerial capacity [he was also Gauleiter of Berlin — JS], but he could not control or foresee the sudden, incalculable, and intrusive operations of the secret police, which seemed to conduct investigations and searches of leading theaters and their personnel independent of any other authority. The Reich Theater Chamber was the main counterpart to the Gestapo. The trouble was that as time went on, the SS [Schutzstaffel, a private police agency of the Nazi party, which gradually fused with the state secret and regular police – JS] turned itself into a universal “counter-intelligence and investigative agency.” It frightened everybody at all levels of authority. People took preventive action and adjusted their behavior and ideas so as not to annoy the SS. Its main journal, Das Schwarze Korps [the Black Corps – JS] had an interest in the arts and interfered with favorable or hostile criticism of productions and artists.

The governing group in the world of ballet – the ballet masters, choreographers, chefs de ballet, leaders of dance groups, soloists in the great Berlin opera houses – maintained close personal contacts with the politicians and power brokers around Hitler, Goring, Goebbels, and Himmler. Such contacts were traded among the top figures in dance. In view of the lawlessness, corruption, and pathological thirst for power in the upper levels of the Nazi State, such contacts became an essential ticket to survival and artistic success and threatened the control exercised by the powerful bureaucrats in the Goebbels ministry. Goebbels was well aware of the importance of influential outsiders and the dancers knew how to use outside contacts to undermine the bureaucracy. I knew of the way the system operated in the opera houses, which was my special terrain and work environment.

There was a powerful and influential group headed by Rudolf K6lling, Liselotte Koster, Jockel Stahl, and Daisy Spiess. Tamara Rauser became the favored ballet mistress. Terpis was tolerated and Jens Keith was a passive member. After Laban, Lizzie Maudrick conquered for herself the ballet direction at the Berlin State Opera. It would be worth analyzing more closely the success of this group in a special study, because these relationships became stable elements in the administration of the opera houses and sources of funding. These relationships explain otherwise incomprehensible unassailable positions held by certain people. Laban and Mary Wigman were absolutely excluded by this group, but they had their own circles, supporters, and patrons. Nobody has yet examined the reciprocal relationships between administrative power and artistic integrity.

The Doctrines of Race and Inheritance
Dance history has so far ignored the influence of these doctrines, and it plays no part in the history of dance after 1945. Yet for certain forms of dance, concepts like “race” and “racial hygiene” played an essential role and were quite consciously adapted to dance. The figures who represented the reformers and renewers of German dance adopted these concepts as the sources of their inspiration and molded both their dancing and pedagogy according to them. Racial ideas stamped their imprint on the almost manic cult of the beautiful body, which sought its models in classical antiquity, and on the style and aesthetic of body education. Expressions of these views are easily found in the many proclamations, monographs, critiques, doctrinal declarations and advertisements produced at the time by the important schools of dance. In the limited framework of this book, there is no place for a proper exploration of the anthropological and sociological aspects, nor the historical origins of the racial doctrines I consider here, so I must, alas, limit my discussion of them to an abbreviated form. I am, however, convinced that my short summary will adequately convey the main arguments used by the artists, dancers, choreographers, and pedagogues in my youth to justify their positions. Human history is also the record of the success of human beings in elevating themselves above other human beings. It is the history of race and racial superiority. How is it that the doctrine of race, in spite of its illogicality and arbitrariness, achieved such prominence after the First World War with such disastrous consequences?

In pre-historic times, primitive peoples developed the idea that their own tribe was the “chosen” one and its members the only “true” people. This view emerged, although there were no marked differences from the members of neighboring tribes. In slave societies in the ancient world, slaves were not reckoned to be human, even if, as was often the case, the slaves originally came from the ruling caste of the defeated tribes or civic communities. The slaveholders in the American south developed a similar view of their black slaves, who were seen as members of a less developed human category, as it were, a race of human beings closer to animals or in their intellectual development very like children.

In feudal society from the Middle Ages to the French Revolution, the nobility and priestly class considered themselves members of a group that represented a higher version of civilization. Every means, from their clothing, stance, and manners, including certain rituals, underlined their godlike qualities. Certain gestures and body movements were dogmatically pre-ordained to demonstrate a special nature of their personalities. This is the origin of the “noble exercises” such as ballet, fencing, and courtly processions. The nobility played a primary role in such development. They played themselves as they wished to be seen. Even kings and the highest worthies appeared in such self-presentations.

Romanticism revived race theories through its preoccupation with “original” types, which bore specific racial features. The discovery of the ideas of Indian wisdom in the eighteenth century led to the theory of an “Aryan” origin of the Germans. Racial myths of romanticism were fed by a yearning for beauty. The “biological” images of race were marked by an aesthetic urge. Johann Joachim Winckelmann’s description of the Greek ideal of human being as it has been conveyed to us in Greek sculpture became the romantic norm and ideal. Once the aesthetic became the scale by which to measure human value, it became necessary to bring reality into harmony with the ideal. Winckelmann’s definitions found their way into anatomy and anthropology and became the measure by which to assess the value of races.

A tall, erect posture, which corresponded in its proportions to the norms found in Greek statues, blonde hair, and blue eyes, were described as specifically Germanic in type as early as the eighteenth century and recognized as the ideal type of the culturally developed human being. The colonizations of the nineteenth century had opened new contacts between Europeans and other peoples, which did not, unfortunately, lead to mutual tolerance and respect for non-European cultures. Thus, for example, the cultures of Africa, and above all its dances, were dismissed as barbaric, obscene, inhuman, and bestial. The foundation and political establishment of protectorates and colonies were frequently accompanied by the brutal use of force of arms and claimed bloody victims on both sides. The initial curiosity of discovery soon turned into fear, lack of understanding, and arrogance. Racism and claims to hegemony found support in the growing European national consciousness, which was supported by religious convictions. Europe declared itself the measure of all things and degraded colonial peoples to unreasonable, lazy children, whose absence of ambition had to be countered by the application of European severity and discipline.

Darwin's doctrine of natural selection, which became known during the middle of the nineteenth century, as well as new discoveries in biology and genetics, represented a further step in the revolutionizing of the natural sciences. The French aristocrat Gobineau tried in the middle of the nineteenth century to create a synthesis of romantic and biological race conceptions. Gobineau, who was at one time French ambassador to Sweden, found a well-prepared ground for his ideas. Following the customs of his time, he gave his musings a scientific system. The title of his book, Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines (An essay on the inequality of human races), gave his readers a clear indication of his message. Gobineau was trying to save the aristocratic order of society in an age of mass popular democracy and an attempt to achieve the equality of all men.

Gobineau believed that human beings were divided into several, mutually incompatible races, each race embodying a set of values. Wherever high culture has flowered, the white race was behind it. Yet even within the white race, there are gradations. There are differences between a small segment of Aryans, the bearers of high culture, and the plebeian masses. "Pure blood" was in Gobineau's view always threatened by contact with the subordinate classes of the people. Gobineau believed that moral activity was not dependent upon the will of individuals, but rather biologically determined. Noble birth makes the individual noble based on his inheritance.

The Invention of the Jewish Race: From Wagner to Rosenberg
Hitler and Rosenberg believed that art was an expression of the race ideal. Gobineau did not. It was toward the end of the nineteenth century that Gobineau's racism was given an aesthetic dimension. Richard Wagner showed the way. Wagner's essay "Uber das Judentum in der Musik" [Concerning Jewishness in Music — JS] formed the starting point of his racist views. According to Wagner, Jews were incapable of real creativity. Every Jewish art exploits the creativity of other peoples. Wagner believed that the growing number of Jewish artists signified the degeneration of culture. In his essay, he demands the destruction of the Jews, by which he certainly did not mean the physical extermination, but rather the exclusion of Jews from cultural enterprises.

Toward the end of his life, probably under the influence of Gobineau, Wagner came to believe in a "racial soul," which displayed constant biological features. His racial views formed a fundamental aspect of his artistic views. The union of racism and social Darwinism, that is, the idea of struggle and the natural right of the survival of the fittest, was carried a step further by Wagner's son-in-law, Houston Stewart Chamberlain, and developed into a theory. In his book The Foundations of the Twentieth Century, Chamberlain claims the creation of a synthesis of the knowledge of his age, and his book was certainly widely read at the time. Chamberlain describes the Germanic race as the bearer of certain ideal characteristics, such as honesty, diligence, loyalty, and consciousness of duty. With the same logic that Gobineau had followed, Chamberlain asserted that Jews represented an evil force, which was determined to undermine the knightly virtues that the Germans embodied. The Germans, as a result, had to do everything in their power to preserve the purity of their blood. Chamberlain placed his emphasis on appearance, rather than genealogy, as Gobineau had done. Wagner had placed art within the realm of politics, and Hitler was an ecstatic admirer of Wagner's music. Art and aesthetics became the mighty instruments with which to promote the pure "Aryan" race, subjecting everything to the demands of nature, where only one law obtained: triumph or death. The enemy was the Jew.

Chamberlain's ideas inspired Alfred Rosenberg to write a sort of sequel to his book, titled "Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts" ("The Myth of the 'Twentieth Century'). This book, along with "Mein Kampf," became the most important programmatic statement of National Socialism. Rosenberg's "Kampfbund für Deutsche Kultur" ("The Fighting League for German Culture), which many dancers and choreographers voluntarily joined, disseminated these ideas.

Mass murder, destruction of Jews, Gypsies, and homosexuals was the logical consequence of Hitler's ideas. Politics became the instrument to realize his ideas, and he saw himself as the instrument ordained by fate to achieve them. He wanted to subordinate society and history to a particular doctrine of nature, to the struggle for life and the struggle for survival.

About one thing there can be no doubt: the great creative figures in German dance admired and accepted Hitler and his ideas. Whether they recognized the full implications of his policies then or later is another question. There were certainly enough voices (including mine) warning the artists in those circles of what would happen. It was more convenient not to listen. Listening damaged careers and the "cause," as Laban used to call it.

The ideology instilled in the Kampfbund was greatly influenced by Rosenberg and his "Myth of the Twentieth Century," a bombastic attempt to fuse German cultural idealism with rabid anti-humanism. At its core stood the eternal opposition between the principle of good and evil, embodied in the "Nordic" and the "Jewish" races. Morality meant to submit without reservation to the law of race. The "racial soul" should beat in the pulse of each and every German. Rosenberg made no secret of the fact that this submission meant complete subordination to the will of the Führer. Only the unlimited power of the Führer could stand as a substitute for personal development.

In times of crisis, race theories and racial hygiene developed their typical features, varying from culture to culture and depending on the prevailing political system and economic interests. Anti-Semitism followed a special historical path. Sects and secret societies had stood in a peculiarly ambivalent relationship to Jews from the Middle Ages on. The relationship fluctuated in terms of its level of rejection and hate for Jews and could rise to militant anti-Semitism. Theosophy provides an interesting and influential case to study. The Theosophical Society was founded in 1873 in the U.S. by Madame Blavatsky, who came from the Ukraine. It was Theosophy that awakened around 1900 the great interest in occultism, spiritualism, reincarnation, and clairvoyant faculties. New sects sprang from the tradition of Theosophy, and old sects were revived, influenced by the occult currents of the time.

Madame Blavatsky believed that the development of earthly life favored a basic race, which she called "Aryans." Her theory had very nasty anti-Semitic elements. Blavatsky declared that her doctrine was born of her clairvoyant abilities and confirmed by her contacts with the spirit world.

Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy and eurythmics, withdrew quite early from the Theosophical Society. Originally a devout follower of Theosophy and Madame Blavatsky, he turned against her principles. Steiner impressed everyone with the integrity of his character. His doctrine was in harmony with his lifestyle and with his writings.

Whereas Blavatsky's teaching had strong anti-Semitic features, Steiner rejected all such attitudes and eventually became a staunch opponent of National Socialism.

Of all the sects, Steiner undoubtedly had the strongest impact on the development of the new arts. He saw himself as Goethe's successor with respect to the latter's pantheistic approach to nature. Steiner included Goethe's doctrine of color into his system, and this influence can be seen in works as different as that of Kandinsky and Beuys.

The idea of the spiritual in art was another influence of Steiner's teaching at the time. It seems to me, drawing on my experience and my memories, that the theosophical and the anthroposophical ideas formed the foundation of what was then called "modern," avant-garde art in all its manifestations.

The anthroposophical movement concentrated in Zurich, Ascona, and Monte Verita, in Vienna, Munich, and Dresden. In Munich, Vasily Kandinsky, together with likeminded artists Franz Marc, August Macke, and Paul Klee, formed an association called Blaue Reiter [Blue Rider - JS]. Mikhail Fokine, as the renovator of dance, was asked for his contributions by the group.

One of the first painters who found his way to the art of dance was Alexander Sacharov, a member of the Blaue Reiter. Other visual artists followed his example: Sophie Tauber, a Laban disciple in Zurich, Oskar Schlemmer, and the architect Max Terpis, the engraver Tatyana Gsovksy, and - one must not forget - Rudolf von Laban himself, who was a trained painter and engraver and had architectural ambitions.

Steiner's influence on dance, from pedagogy to performance itself, was much stronger than the Labanists were willing to admit. Steiner's own therapeutic dance method, eurhythmia, depended on studied movements, very like Laban's efforts theory and was being practiced on the Monte Verita as early as the beginning of the century. Steiner's influence can be read in Laban's Die Welt des Ténzers, [The World of the Dancer - JS] published in 1920. Laban had the same urge to transform scientific findings into mysticism and preferred an intuitive understanding of natural phenomena to scientific and analytic methods. All these tendencies reveal the yearning of the period for a belief in occult forces and visions, and the healing powers of dance movement, and its expression in the magical meaning of letters and syllables, and the spiritual manifestations of soul embedded in the use of colors. The great dance reformers demanded an almost religious confidence in the “cause” from their students and disciples, and an absolute willingness to sacrifice themselves. They were not content with the idea of professionalism, which had dominated the art of dance up to that time, and for us, stage dancers represented the only criterion by which to measure ability.

The new “true” dancers were really believers, sanctified by the magic and religion proclaimed by their teacher and guru. We professional dancers were on the other side: we too did great things and served our art, but we also made our livings from it and had therefore a much more profane attitude to dance, which, of course, did not exclude a passionate love for dance either.

In the U.S. alongside Delsartism, the Mazdaznan sect gained a following, which made principles of movement and racial hygiene its central tenets. The Mazdaznan movement made an impact on the Berlin dance scene. True believing disciples of this doctrine in the 1930s were Jutta Klamt and her husband Gustav Fischer-Klamt. Jutta Klamt founded one of the most important schools of artistic dance, which her husband Lilian Karina, a former Laban pupil, directed. After Laban’s “fall” in 1937, he took over the master’s role as the leading theoretician and analyst of dance in Germany.

There is no doubt that the Klamt school was very much the equal of the Wigman school in prestige and public recognition. Many dancers claimed at the time that the Mazdaznan movement had as many disciples in German dance circles as Delsartism did in the U.S. Klamt pupils with whom I spoke, above all Herta Wegeleben and her sister, Hilde Buchwald, later a movement teacher for actors, told me all about the instruction in the Klamt school. Breathing was the central focus. Mazdaznan breathing consisted of forced breathing exercises, which took place for an hour before the dance lesson proper. Dance instruction consisted mainly of improvisation, from which the choreographic movement style was derived.

Mazdaznan doctrine originally classified Jews as members of the white race, and the distinction between Aryan and non-Aryan played no part. In 1936, the sect, together with many others, was forbidden by the Nazis. The practices of the various ideas in dance showed how fluid the boundary was between certain sects and the National-Socialist movement. The views of the dance religions did not have to be identical with those of the Nazis. The right insight at the right moment was all that mattered. The Klamts had that insight and both became members of the Nazi party.

Laban was strongly opposed to the Mazdaznan movement. Against his will, Suzanne Perrottet, his lover while he lived in Switzerland, put their son, Allar, in the care of the sect “Aryana”, which was close to the Mazdaznan movement in Herr-liberg, Zurich. She described the sects in her memoirs: The ancient wisdom of Zarathustran grand ideas comes from a temple order of the central Asian steppe. It is the oldest doctrine of the care of body and soul ... It includes breathing, relaxation, harmony- and concentration-exercises and a doctrine of nutrition.* Other cruder descriptions of the doctrine link anti-Semitism to nature mysticism. All descriptions emphasize breathing and concentration exercises. In Rauschning’s Gespréiche mit Hitler [Conversations with Hitler — JS] the subject of sects comes up: “What Hitler really wants, and what National Socialism should carry out, does not appear in Mein Kampf. That book is for the masses. But National Socialism also has a secret doctrine. It is taught and transmitted in special groups within a more restricted elite. In the SS, in the HJ [Hitler Youth — JS], in leading political circles, in all cadre organizations, there is a stratum of ordinary members and a group of initiates. The Hitler ... who speaks here, is not in the ordinary sense of the word “normal” ... but the demonic voice of destruction ... Therefore, if Hitler wins, not only borders of states will change. Then everything that made sense or had value for human beings will come to an end ... [Hitler declared:] “One thing is really dangerous and that is what I have taken over from free masonry. They form a kind of priestly nobility. They cut themselves off by special customs. They have worked out a secret wisdom, which is no simple formulated doctrine but something that yields higher insights step-by-step through its symbols and rites ... that is the danger and greatness that I have taken over from them. Do you not see that our party must become something very similar? An order, the hierarchical structure Sectarianism and Dance 33 of a worldly priesthood, but that means naturally that there can be nothing like it on the other side. It is either us or the freemason or the church.”4° In the U.S. the influence of jazz on young people began to frighten the established circles of the bourgeoisie. It was symbolic of the threat of miscegenation. The very symbol, the keeper of the white race, the white woman, was now in danger. During the epoch of slavery it had been acceptable for a white man to impregnate a black woman but for a black man to have sexual relations with a white woman was seen as a mortal sin, punishable by torture, mutilation, and death. It was believed that the “human race” would be seriously endangered by lapses of this kind. In reaction, women’s dance, gymnastics, and calisthenics gained the highest of priorities. The calisthenics movement, which came out of England originally, was spread in the U.S. by Geneviéve Stebbins, a teacher of Isadora Duncan. Both Loie Fuller and Isadora Duncan had their first meaningful experiences of dance in the framework of this style. The idea of beauty and the ideal body went hand-in-hand in these dance movements along with discrimination against the members of other races. If one speaks of Duncan’s national feminism, it must be agreed that her feminism excludes not only all people of color but also all those who fail to match the “eugenic” claims of the nation. Eugenics, which had become very influential in the U.S. perfectly fit into the leading tendencies of the German hatred of Jews. The hygiene of inheritance turned into racial hygiene. This transformation can be easily followed in the writings of Elizabeth Duncan. I think in this connection of Isadora Duncan’s aggressive observations about blacks and jazz and her more or less open distaste for male dancers and male dance teachers serving as models for girls enthusiastic about dance*”: I say it is of the utmost importance to a nation to train children to the understanding and execution of movements of great heroic and spiritual beauty, to raise their many bans on the realization of sex, which is a fine thing in itself, and to put the same prohibitions on the frivolous caricature and symbols of sex which are found in such dances as fox trot and black bottom. Elizabeth Duncan opened her school at Marienhöhe/Darmstadt in 1911. The leader and ideological driving force was her husband Max Merz, who later became a fanatical anti-Semite and Nazi. In the school, “racial hygiene” was on the curriculum. The student body consisted entirely of women and girls. Isadora’s devotion to all things Greek was joined with an almost manic fascination with, and admiration for, Germanic mythologies and “Nordic” rites. An almost religious dedication to turn female dance into a creative prayer marked the extraordinary mixture of ideas in her vision for the dance of the future.

The Duncan School and its leader Max Merz offer an example of the way in which the intellectual situation of the years from the beginning of the Weimar Republic to Hitler’s assumption of totalitarian power influenced the attitudes of many artists and creative dancers. Through people like Merz, certain ideas became respectable and could be expressed openly.

In 1912, Max Merz wrote about the goals and organization of the Elizabeth (sometimes also called Elisabeth) Duncan School:

"The leading idea, which forms the basis in a purely ideal sense of the objective of the Elizabeth Duncan school, is the ennoblement of the race and the cultivation of those forms and expressions of life, which emerge in aesthetic and ethical activity. Its immediate goal is to train women to teach who are dedicated to this ideal. Everyone should be clear from the outset that the roots of this enterprise are to be found happily joined to the social and cultural appearances of our day and to the receptivity of the school’s leading personalities for the signs of the times, and this juncture gives our work its intensity and practical direction.

Long-winded defenses of the necessity for racial hygiene no longer need to be made when everybody can see its importance in the education of our youth and in the future of nations ... and yet one more thing that you ought never forget: remember that you are German and the product of German soil. That you do not forget it will be my concern as long as I stand at the head of this enterprise..."

In 1926, Max Merz wrote a booklet entitled Tanz in dieser Zeit [Dance in this time — JS], which contains this:

"The artificial postures of the eighteenth-century dance masters, which still continue to live a shadowy existence, drew the attention of Elizabeth Duncan to the appalling signs of a progressive degeneration, which could be observed over the years in hundreds of children from high, middle and bottom layers of society. She conceived of the Duncan School as a place where pupils would board and with the advice and cooperation of doctors and hygienists these trends could be reversed. Its artistic calling, which occasioned its foundation, led inexorably to the recognition of the demands of racial hygiene. It took decisive action against the mindless and automatic transfer of the male way to train the body onto the female sex, which was thereby compelled to deny its essential nature as well as to neglect the physiological laws of the female sex itself.

Racial hygiene and artistic demands overlap perfectly in this enterprise, for the bodily instruction and training of the woman must take place within aesthetic limits, if they are to be true to the deepest essence of womanhood ... In Elizabeth Duncan’s aesthetic declaration of faith, strongly ethical and religious features are expressed. Life and art are one." In 1938, Max Merz provided the text for a cartoon that showed two black people engaged in a jazz dance, which was regarded as "a poisonous drug for the white race." Merz's caption read, "Jazz production - Jewish domains. The fact is that jazz production and its distribution are domains of the Jews." This connection of jazz music and dance with Jews led to the idea that Jews were responsible for the hated jazz music and dance. Initially, concepts like "race," "racial hygiene," and "mother earth" were vague and imprecise, but they became more violent in the pamphlets and posters of the National Socialists. These ideas were also propagated in the U.S. and other parts of Europe, with racial political arguments used against blacks and as a warning against miscegenation.

In Hitler's world of ideas, the debates mirrored the struggle for survival of the white race between the "Aryans" and Jews, leading to the ideologies and ideals of body culture in dance and movement. Dancers and choreographers had prepared minds by accustoming them to certain arguments and images of the enemy, which the Nazis could later easily use. Rudolf von Laban's opinions on African-American populations revealed his racism and contempt for other ways of life and other races. He believed that "niggers" were a less developed species of humanity, closer to animals than to white humans. His theories were based on the belief that the soil shaped animal nature and brought forth biological differences, which determined racial characteristics.

Sixteen years later, Laban described his artistic ambitions in the Nordische Rundschau of 29 July 1936, as follows: "My direction of movements and groups ... strives to create a new, absolutely racially based, dance cult, which naturally can be built into the opera ..." Other artists reacted to these chauvinistic and national tendencies, which so marked the 1920s. In his 1929 novel Der Fall Maurizius, Jacob Wassermann described it very well; the ageing teacher Warenne-Warschauer warned his sixteen-year-old pupil, Etzel Andergast: "I warn you to be careful of those with a noble glint in their eyes, those Greek cultists, the priests of the new rhythm, the exotics, the illuminated, who celebrate the hermaphroditic God with their black masses. These people will never let up in their hunt for you. The cult has won over hordes of disciples for the simple reason that they want to couple Mars with Eros in order to strengthen him through secret rites after their gruesome defeat. ... Brutal bloody application of these pseudo-scientific theories characterize fascism." The New Magicians of Dance: Steiner, Klamt, Duncan, Laban

Over the course of centuries, scientists had gradually freed themselves from magic to explain apparently supernatural, mysterious circumstances and turned towards demonstrable scientific insights and analyses. Founders of sects and cults like Rudolf Steiner or Rudolf von Laban wanted to grant the healing element of movement—in Laban's case the movement of dancers; in Steiner's case rhythmic movement—a scientific status, although they were careful not to let scientific proof get out of hand, since they demanded a nearly religious devotion of their followers and pupils to the "cause" and to themselves as the prophets of the "cause."*4

In the years 1912 to 1914, when Laban ran his summer courses on the Monte Verita near Ascona in Switzerland, he would have liked to compete with Steiner, the great guru of anthroposophy, for dominance. He was encouraged in this by the near universal subordination of his followers. They confirmed his almost hypnotic powers over his disciples again and again. Wigman spoke of Laban, "the magician, the priest of an unknown religion."*10 In the year 1916 in Zurich, Laban tried to found a sect in the true sense of the word. He was already a free mason. Suzanne Perrottet confirmed the fact in her memoirs, as well as the failure of the sect on economic grounds.*10 In the 1920s Mary Wigman succeeded in evoking through her choreography the mystical atmosphere of a dancing community of faith. Her pupils had to enter a communion of faith with her in soul and spirit. The elements of her choreography were actually simple, everyday movements: walking, running, and striding achieved a communal, almost ritual dependency on the movements of the mistress and a hypnotic impact on the numerous members of the public who were also prepared and ready for the ritual.

By 1930 Laban, as ballet director at the Berlin State Opera, found himself in an impossible position. His artistic claims, which had previously depended entirely on the magnetism of his personality, no longer held sway. In the opera Laban had to work with professional dancers from all the camps. He did not succeed in separating out the "non-believers" and dismissing them on the sly and without fuss. He could not invoke the magic of his dance religion against the disturbing criticism in such an atmosphere. Laban's pupils like Kurt Jooss and Aurél von Milloss turned themselves into significant choreographers because they understood what the master did not, that one had to work with the traditions and forms in the theater, to accept the conditions of the stage, and the claims of other artistic collaborators.

The choreographers, ballet masters and their legendary ballerinas of the Romantic era never did entirely free themselves from the fair ground shows of their ancestors. They wanted to please their audiences with spells, transformation scenes, magic light effects and glitter. They tried to enchant their audience with swirling bodies, suddenly disappearing acts, and the tensions of high drama. The supernatural beings, the sylphides, the wilis, the dead Giselle, all danced to the waltzes of bourgeois society. Romanticism was the epoch of the great triumphs in dance, but one that rested on a fusion of profession and family, as in the circus, where virtuosity was developed and practiced from the earliest years of childhood. The revolutionaries of new dance came from the higher rungs of the social ladder. They certainly had no desire to simply be strolling players or theatrical folk; they were the representatives of the occult in art, and more than pleasant servants; they wanted to enter the mysterious realms themselves. They did not want merely to play spirits; they wanted to be spirits. They wanted to give birth to a dance form drawn from their own experiences in the spiritual medium. They tried to understand the realm of the spirit in the art of dance as part of the sphere of the supernatural and to be part of it or at least near it through their art.

Why have I devoted so much space to this consideration of sects and cults? The answer is that the story of modern dance cannot be understood without knowing about the part played by the cults, a knowledge that has been suppressed and ignored. Furthermore, there is a direct link to the history of dance under the Nazis: the attempt by the Nazis to make trouble for Laban and Wigman. Never mind that both artists made every effort to place their art at the disposal of the new regime, the Nazis never forgave them their connection to the world of the occult. The Nazis hated the whole sectarian community. They persecuted the sects and communities of faith in order to ensure their ideology complete supremacy.

I see it as significant that Rosenberg's "The Myth of the Twentieth Century" has all the characteristics of a typical cultic tract. Like many similar publications of the 1920s, it mystifies politics, culture, and art. This version of the occult became dangerous when the Nazis gained absolute power, and using Rosenberg's ideas as a background, they began an unspeakable barbarism and made war. Even post-Labanism, in spite of its transformation into a useful methodology, never quite lost a certain sense of sectarianism.

The Search for a Dance "True to Type" [ "arteigen" ]

The National Socialists tried to find a dance form that would be racially "true to type" [ "arteigen" ] or related to type [ "artverwandt" ]. The Nazis meant specifically the German or Aryan "type," in the sense of their specific ideological vocabulary. Such a dance was intended to be "national" both in its social and artistic forms. It had to derive from and specifically reflect Germanic cults, Germanic mythology, and German or Nordic "gothic" popular or folk dances. Dance was to be a means to glorify the ideals, symbols, and deeds of the National-Socialist movement.

Fritz Bohme, one of Laban's disciples and his "theoretician," put it this way: "Even the dancer must first be self-aware as a German human being and deeply embedded in the National-Socialist movement, not just outwardly but inwardly as a whole person in will, thought, and feeling. The dancer must cultivate this inner sense, for only then can his act and work be directed by his creativity ... Wehrmacht, Party, SA, SS, Hitler Youth, the League of German Girls, Land Service, Foreign Service represent our people. In these activities, the straight and genuine-feeling German person is educated in the National-Socialist way. Here too is the dancer's moment. Dance has always been and is now, and the art of dance too will flourish through the German National-Socialist renewal." That was, of course, an impossible objective. Dance as a creative, choreographic art form is like all art forms, that is only partly or hardly at all controllable by the dictates of politics. The text you provided contains a lot of information about the history of dance during the Nazi era. Here is a cleaned-up version of the text, with incorrect joinings of words separated and headers removed:

It lives from the variety of its impulses and influences. Thus, in spite of the readiness of many dancers and choreographers to adapt themselves to the desires of those holding power, in the end, there never was an ideal Nazi form of dance, only approaches and attempts to gain acceptance. Wigman took refuge in the unreality of "autonomous" absolute dance. During the years from 1933 to 1937, Laban, Wigman, Palucca, and others wrote happily about subjects in which "blood" and "soil" in their relationship to dance in all its aspects could be treated. Laban in particular advocated ideas that fit the Nazi ideological framework. Laban, Fritz Bohme, and Gustav Joachim Fischer-Klamt were the 38 Lilian Karina main theoreticians and writers on dance during the Nazi era. They took on the task of adapting and evaluating art and artists according to Nazi principles and criteria and are to be held responsible for that effort.

Fritz Bohme and Joachim Fischer-Klamt, who enjoyed the backing of Rolf Cunz, the highly influential desk officer for dance in the Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda, were undoubtedly determined to place dance in all of its aspects, that is, in both an ideal and artistic sense, under the laws of Nazi politics. In those years, roughly until 1937, Laban too enjoyed the support of the same civil servant and received, despite illness, an extension of his contract. "Racial and inheritance doctrines" became more and more important parts of all dance instruction. In the Meisterwerkstatten, the Master workshop institutions in Berlin, which were intended as forerunners of a Dance Academy, such theoretical subjects took an ever more dominant place.>8

The Yearbook for 1937, which I cited several times, was written in 1936. It brought all the various pieces of legislation and administrative regulation of dance together and was supposed to make clear the principles of the conditions for further development. On the face of it, the book contained nothing new. It collated the well-known items, the achievements, and the desiderata. Everything that had been announced in the form of declarations since 1933 now became brutal reality. What had been vague, embedded in symbol or statements of morality was now turned into gruesome practice. In any historical assessment of the leading figures of the new dance, this work needs to be seen in its full importance and should not be underestimated.>?

CHAPTER 4

The Fates of Emigrants

Archives, correspondence, and personal conversations have enabled me to reconstruct the stories of several of the dancers who were forced to leave Germany and seek refuge in "neutral" countries. My own experiences, my memories, and my own personal fate certainly contributed to my ability to sense what must have happened to others. I must, however, emphasize that there is in these matters no absolute truth, nor have I sought definitive answers. In spite of the documents that survive, too much material is missing to completely illuminate the human tragedies of many dancers. Many papers turned up in the wrong places in archives; some narrowly survived destruction. Others, which would have greatly helped my insights, were either destroyed or misplaced. In any case, there is still no comprehensive study of this period. Anarchy in the judicial sphere, exceptions, and constant interventions in official legislation permitted decisions that are hard to grasp. Based on my own experience, I can only summarize that there were, in fact, connections that remained misunderstood. The cases of Aurél von Milloss (discussed in this chapter) and Elsa Linden- berg (discussed in the next chapter) or Laban's expulsion of the "non-Aryan children," have made me aware of the exceptional procedures that ran parallel to the legal or published versions. The "elimination" of "unreliable" employees seems to have followed a standard pattern. Immediately after the Nazi seizure of power on 30 January 1933, those with oppositional views, the communists, social democrats, and liberals, were affected. Many of the best known leaders had been on Nazi blacklists for years. The ban first hit political opponents, which was not unexpected; among them were several artistic dancers like Valeska Gert and Jean Weidt. The "Aryan question" came later and many more professional dancers became involved; first the Jews, then the half-Jews, then those married to Jews, then those who had Jewish "relations"; all of them were persecuted. After the Rohm Putsch in 1934 [the so-called "night of the long knives" when Hitler eliminated his enemies on 30 June 1934 —JS] the Nazis began to make use of the accusation of homosexuality as a new and very effective instrument of persecution and destruction. The mere suspicion that a person was homosexual was enough to set the persecution machinery into gear. A smile in a restaurant, a hint, a denunciation, were enough. All threats to "the hereditary substance" ["die Erbmasse" — JS] had to be eliminated. Persecution of homosexuals seemed at first incredible, but the growing aggressiveness of the campaign was simply beyond anyone's imagination. The persecution hit the dance world hard. Great artists felt themselves so threatened by a mere mention, which contained no sort of evidence, that many dropped everything and simply fled in panic. As the campaign against homosexuals proceeded to become more methodical, fear for one's own safety pushed many homosexuals into a position of collaboration with the authorities, denouncing others for a promise from the police that they be left alone. This also hit the dance world quite hard. The discrimination against homosexuals was certainly comparable to the persecution of Jews, Gypsies and "non-Aryans." Persecution of homosexuals rested on racial hygienic criteria. Homosexuals "disturbed the genetic stream" and were "unworthy on hereditary biological grounds." After Hitler came to power, the campaign began sporadically, but after the Rohm affair it was significantly more consistent, more bureaucratic and a greater danger to life. The Gestapo, but not only them, pursued and followed up certain cases, as can be seen in the examples of Alexander von Swaine, Aurél von Milloss or later of Rudolf von Laban. In the SS magazine Das Schwarze Korps, an article appeared on 22 May 1937 in which K.A. Eckart described the "unnatural degeneracy" as something "worthy of a death sentence." The article was republished in the legal journal Deutsche Rechtswissenschaft, Volume III (1938) under the title "Unnatural degeneracy." Evgenia Eduardova and Josef Lewitan The First World War and the 1917 Russian Revolution had long-lasting and unexpected consequences for the development of European dance. In Germany, the free dance movement, which had gradually spread, suddenly faced new and powerful antagonists in the struggle for public esteem. A real invasion of Tsarist dancers and artists flooded westwards to Berlin and Western Europe. The ballet dancers were the most prominent. They came as refugees who either could not or would not go back to Russia. Many stayed in Berlin and opened schools, where they taught Italian-Russian ballet technique. The stars of Tsarist ballet appeared everywhere, in concert halls, in philharmonias, in the Bliithner or the Bechstein Halls in Berlin, in the variety theaters Skala and Wintergarten, on the more intimate stages of cabarets, even in night clubs, restaurants and festival halls. Ballet was "russified" and even non-Russians took on sonorous Russian-sounding names in order to display their quality. Many of these immigrants were forced to get by illegally, without papers, passports or documents, and mostly without any economic support. Few had a work or residence permit.

The first wave of Russian émigrés included the great ballerinas and dancers who had no need for support from their new country. They survived by selling their valuables, their jewels, antiques, and furs. The extraordinary technical abilities of the Russian ballet dancers were immensely impressive and in a relatively short time they transmitted these remarkable techniques to their pupils, creating an entirely new ballet culture across Europe.

The great ballerinas, famous idols of a previous period of greatness in Russia, had a considerable audience in the Russian émigré communities. An enthusiastic press made their fame even greater. The ballerinas came in the company of spouses, lovers, managers, impresarios. They counted princes, generals, famous figures in the world of culture, among their followings.

One of these was the ballerina Evgenia Platonova Davidova, née Eduardova. She arrived in Berlin sometime in 1920 together with her husband Davidov, as well as with Josef Lewitan and a general who had been her patron. She opened a school in Berlin that attracted pupils who belonged to the younger generation of émigré dancers. Her ballet studio was one of the first of its kind in Berlin. The children and young people from emigrant circles followed them. In time the school attracted a wider circle of people interested in dance, sometimes lay people but often professionals.

The interest in Russian ballet technique was so great that a number of the existing schools for classical ballet in Berlin and Paris simply had to close down. Only a few survived the crisis by concentrating on the much-loved public children's performances and by using a completely different pedagogic technique (for example, Mary Zimmermann in Berlin). In surviving in that way they lost all influence on the substance of classical ballet as an artistic professional endeavor. The training of professional dancers fell more and more in the hands of the modern dancers or the Russian ballet schools.

Evgenia lived with Josef Davidovich Lewitan, a young lawyer who also came from St. Petersburg. Lewitan helped her found and develop what became the famous Eduardova school. Lewitan, who in his next exile in Paris called himself "un homme des letters," arranged everything for Eduardova. He accompanied her everywhere, prepared the ground for her everywhere, covered her lapses in culture and education with his rich linguistic skills and broad culture, and built up her status as the "balle-rina" of the Maryinsky Theater. In fact, in Russia, she had only been a "coryphée" [a rank in the ballet hierarchy — JS] and so had a position somewhere between a soloist and a member of the chorus. It was not long before Lewitan began to enjoy an excellent reputation in Berlin as an outstanding reviewer and critic of dance productions, and as an essayist. He took an active part in the dance world and indeed influenced it substantially. His reviews, critiques, and articles are still read today with great interest because they provide one of the most important sources of information about the development of dance in the Weimar years. Although Lewitan inspired important dance critics for generations to come, the critic Horst Koegler, who benefited greatly from Lewitan’s work, only mentions him in his 1977 Concise Oxford Dictionary of Ballet as Eduardova’s husband. Lewitan was a Jew. Hitler’s seizure of power was a catastrophe for the couple, the full extent of which they could not at first foresee. Lewitan lost the ownership of his magazine Der Tanz after the Nazis came to power in 1933. He went to Warsaw to judge a ballet competition in which the winner was the famous dancer Ruth 42 Lilian Karina Abramovitsch. As a Jew and a “leftist,” as Elsa Lindenberg described, she had been dismissed from the Berlin State Opera. Lewitan returned from Warsaw one more time to Berlin.

From the permits, testimonies, and passports, which can be found in the Dance Collection in New York, it is clear that he took an active part in the cultural life of the Jewish community in Berlin. In the dance collection, I found a membership card for the Zionist Landes Scheckel, one of the Zionist Leagues, made out in Lewitan’s name and valid from October 1936 to 30 September 1937. There is also a certificate stating that Lewitan was a member of the administration of the Habimah Theater. As many others, he seemed to have cherished the hope that Jews in Germany would be allowed the modest right to be culturally active within certain strict limits. But Lewitan was not even German. He and Eduardova held Nansen passports and were in effect stateless.

To escape this dreadful situation, Lewitan applied for a job in Paris at the Archive de la Danse. The correspondence still exists. Lewitan received an invitation through a request of the founder, Rolf de Maré, dated 23 October 1937 and signed by the director of the archive, Pierre Tugal. The invitation made it possible for Lewitan to leave Germany. In his passport, I found the visa for his departure stamped with the words “keine Riickreise” [no return journey — JS].

In the meantime, Eduardova struggled desperately to survive; that is, she tried to save her famous ballet school. In 1934, she became a member of the Reich Theater Chamber. Her membership book in the Fachschaft Tanz [the professional dance corporation — JS] is also in the Dance Collection in New York. The last payment was made in November 1937. On 4 September, she got the last formal permit to operate a special school for ballet and modern dance. The permit was signed by Alfred E. Frauenfeld, a notorious Austrian Nazi and managing director of the Reich Theater Chamber.

In the Dance Collection, I found an obituary for Eduardova dated 1960. In 1961, the Hamburg journal Dance Archiv published an interview with Savitskaya, a pupil of Eduardova who had visited her teacher in 1935. She writes: “... I found her weeping. The Nazi party made many difficulties for her ... she would have to leave everything ... shortly after that she emigrated.” As in Lewitan’s case, the emigration to Paris took place later: Eduardova left Germany only in 1938. The stamp in her passport proves it and is dated 6 October 1938. It too bears the stamp “keine Riickreise.” In 1937, the Reich Theater Chamber forbade all assumed names, pseudonyms, and stage names, and any alterations of civil names and status. No concealing of real origins was henceforth permitted. Evgenia Davidova, born Eduardova, was now called Evgenia Davidova. Her newly issued Nansen passport, D/2038 of 11 July 1938, bore those names. Eduardova emigrated freely. When I visited her in 1935, she had said to me, "I cannot live without Ossip Davidovich [Josef Lewitan - LK]." This was the reason she left: she left for love. In fact, she had no need to flee and live a life of terrible uncertainty. Since Victor Gsovsky had been forced to leave Germany in 1936, her school was the biggest and most important in Berlin. In the meantime, she had gathered all the necessary Nazi permits and certificates. Her best pupil and intimate friend Sabine Ress? had patrons among the best-known Nazis, and Europe was still at peace, and the Third Reich seemed to be going through a period of expansion, even in dance. Indeed, Berlin was becoming the center of dance developments. But Eduardova left nonetheless for Paris to join Lewitan. In Paris, their via dolorosa really began.

I was no longer in personal contact with them during this period, because I too was in flight from the Nazis. What I know today, I learned from documents and papers. I can only let the archives speak. Many questions cannot be answered any more. For example, it is unclear how they both lived and how they paid their bills. Did she still get the small pension from the Maryinsky Theater? The response to her pension claim, confirmed by the Soviet authorities in 1918, is in the New York archive. Or did she get some other pension, which was paid to employees of the Tsar? Had she saved jewelry or other valuables, in order to sell them? Did they have friends who helped them? Eduardova's attempts to teach again failed. She earned next to nothing from her ballet lessons. Lewitan's prospects of earning something through writing articles must have been very restricted. In his residence permit, there is the degrading entry: "Israelite entré en France aprés | janvier 1936." War was about to break out. After a "revision," which is marked in Lewitan's papers and probably refers to an alteration in the conditions of his residence permit, he joined the French Foreign Legion, a famous fighting unit in the French Army. He thereby extended his residence permit to 14 April 1941. Paris fell on 22 June 1940. Lewitan and Eduardova would probably have left Paris before the German troops marched in. The identity cards indicate a stay in the "Pyrenées Basses." Lewitan was registered as an "ouvrier agricole," a farm laborer. Eduardova followed him. How that was possible, since they were not married, remains unclear. In the interim, both had received identity cards and no longer carried Nansen passports. On 23 April 1942, they got emigration visas for Cuba, made out in the Consulato da Cuba in Marseilles. They probably intended to somehow transit from there to some other destination. In any case, Lewitan had applied for a different visa, and they both received them for Casablanca for 2 November 1942. The North African visa may have been the first step in the transit visa to Cuba, but whatever it meant, it ensured that Lewitan had won the struggle against certain death. On 10 November 1942, scarcely a week later, German troops occupied the Vichy zone in reaction to the Allied landing on the north African coast two days earlier. It was a narrow escape. If Lewitan and Eduardova had fallen into the hands of the Gestapo, they would both have certainly died. On 13 May 1943, Evgenia Eduardova and Josef Lewitan married. The star of David on the marriage certificate indicates that they had a Jewish wedding. Evgenia's French identity card bore the name Eduardova, suggesting that she avoided using the name Davidova. Even though she had been living with Lewitan for years, she probably was not yet divorced from her first husband or widowed. Further evidence reveals that Lewitan worked for the American army and navy. The war went on, and the invasion of North Africa led to the landing in Italy. Another document testifies to Lewitan's effectiveness as "Base Purchasing Agent" for the U.S. Navy, and an official U.S. Army document, which commended his services, opened the way for him to enter the U.S. Armed with the letter of recommendation from the U.S. Army, the couple finally got their entry visa for the U.S., where Lewitan got a job working for the United Nations in New York.

A dancer who lived in New York told my friend Michael Piel that Evgenia Eduardova was a wreck after the war. She tried once again to start a ballet school and once again it failed to work. She tried to describe and transmit the ballet techniques of the Maryinsky Theater ballet school. There are some notes of her work in the New York Dance Collection, but she could not recapture her success in Berlin. Lewitan cared for her in a deeply touching way until her death. In 1960, she died after a fall in her bathroom.

Victor Gsovsky

In the second half of the 1920s, at the end of the Russian civil war and after the victory of the Bolsheviks, a second wave of Russian emigrants arrived in Germany. The catastrophes of the First World War had been followed by a disastrous famine and the horrors of civil war. Tatyana and Victor Gsovsky are part of this wave. Tatyana was a graphic artist, a pupil from the school of Leon Bakst; she was also a pianist and dancer, and the daughter of the famous "free," modern dancer Clavdia Issatyenko (married name: Sokolova). Victor Gsovsky taught a new approach to ballet both in theory and practice. His work at the Berlin State Opera from 1925 to 1930, his instruction in his private school, and his fascinating personality exercised an enormous influence on the greater part of the dance world. Even the younger Labanists, as well as many dancers, pedagogues, and choreographers from the most diverse schools of dance, were impressed by him.

Gsovsky was dismissed as director of ballet from the Berlin State Opera in 1930, just before Laban took his position. Laban made it a condition of his contract that Gsovsky leave. The dancers who then rebelled against Laban, contributing to the Laban "case," including original Labanists, once more became pupils of Victor Gsovsky and visited his private studio. Among the soloists at the State Opera whom Laban dismissed when he took up his position were Daisy Spiess, Dorothea Albu, Genia Nikolayeva, Rudolf Kélling, Jens Keith, and Rolf Jahnke.

Although I received my basic ballet training from Eduardova, I always considered myself one of Gsovsky's pupils. He saw that I had talent as a teacher, and so developed my pedagogic capacities and supervised the first ballet classes I gave. I adopted his style as a dancer as well as a teacher. After the Second World War, I often met Victor Ivanovich Gsovsky in Paris. Our last conversation took place in Zurich, where he used to give his annual summer course at the Dolder in the 1960s. He told me about his escape from Germany. In 1937, while he was working as a guest artist with the Markova-Dolin Company, he got a warning not to return to Berlin. He had apparently been denounced to the Gestapo and accused of having homosexual relations with one of his students. The Gestapo had arrived at his school looking for him. Gsovsky went to Paris, where the famous Russian ballet teacher, Mme. Roussanne, took him on. Her ballet school consisted of a studio in the famous Studio Wacker, where the great Preobrazhensky and other stars of the Ballets Russes of the Tsarist epoch taught. With Rousanne, Gsovsky trained some of the stars of French ballet, great dancers like Jean Babilée, Roland Petit, Colette Marchand, Violette Verdy, and Yvette Chauviré, among others. Gsovsky then took over Mme. Roussanne's professional classes and began a new career in Paris. As in the 1920s in Berlin, he once again had a sensational impact on the Paris dance world. He became the favorite teacher of many distinguished figures who accepted his very special pedagogic style and aesthetics.

Finally, in 1945, he was engaged by the Paris Opera to choreograph several pieces. His first work was the choreography of the second act of Swan Lake, after the original choreography of Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov, which was a tremendous success.

In 1947, while the author was in Paris, he noticed that Gsovsky had not been able to overcome his second forced exile, despite his huge success and new career. He missed Berlin so much that he began to disintegrate and became mentally ill. Doubts about the loyalty of his wife Tatyana plagued him and gave him no peace. Alcoholism for an utterly rootless émigré is particularly incurable. He got worse and worse. Only when he was fully drunk was he able to talk openly and report on his feelings. These "confessions" gave him temporary respite.

In one of those conversations of the 1960s, which went on for hours, he told the author that his wife had been the one who denounced him to the Gestapo in order to get her hands on the school and the money in its account. He told the same story to Liselotte Késter, his favorite pupil, who visited him in hospital in Hamburg shortly before his death. He had no proof for this suspicion and begged Liselotte Kster and the author to investigate the story and find out why he had been forced to flee. The author did not succeed in finding out why.

The cooperation with musical collaborator Fritz Cohén was one of the preconditions of Gsovsky's work. To describe his work method briefly: he choreographed initially without music. He improvised without music, following the rhythm of his own movements, which as perfectly as possible were ordered according to his dramatic intentions. Cohén sketched his improvisations in a written notation and, on the following day, appeared with the first music sketches. Cohén had immersed himself in Gsovsky's work. Gsovsky's dancers would then make suggestions, which would be worked on. After the Nazi seizure of power, an emissary from the authorities appeared, who declared that the name Cohén must be stricken from the program. It was all very diplomatic, careful, and delicately stated: “please just the name, not the music. ‘We want no change there.” In addition, two pupils were to be sent away. I was constantly reassured that I was not personally in any danger. But Kurt Jooss was not prepared to compromise and categorically refused any offers.® A few of my trusted associates and I packed the tour bus, which we left ready to depart at any moment. I called an evening rehearsal. After the rehearsal ended, I told them that on that very night we were going to go on tour. The dancers should go home and pack their things. They all still had their passports from the Paris trip. I explained to them that this tour meant leaving Germany for good. A few went to get their wives; a few decided not to go with us. When I was asked what security for the future we had, | replied, “Friends in Holland will put us up” and “we have to get out of here.” These were Kurt Jooss’s words. Bengt Hager told me more: Beryl de Zoete picked them up on the Dutch frontier and they stayed with her at first. The stay and settlement at Dartington Hall had already been organized and arranged. In Essen—the great scandal, the departure, was hushed up. There followed accusations against Jooss, and then the line was that it was better to be rid of him. The Nazis acted as if the Jooss Group were just touring. In 1936 Jooss was invited by Niedecken-Gebhardt to participate in the Dance Olympics. Jooss made his appearance conditional: the whole group and works that he chose would be performed or he would not come. The conditions were not accepted. Advertisements for Jooss’s school at Dartington continued to appear in the magazine Der Tanz, as if nothing had happened. I saw many myself. The Nazis tried to cover up such disastrous consequences of anti-Semitism on the world of art.

Sascha Leontieff
Sascha Leontieff, whose real name was Michael Katz, was born in 1897 in Riga and died on 24 August 1942 in Mauthausen. I got to know Sascha in 1930 in the Gsovsky school. Tatyana had known him in the Soviet Union. My collaboration with my partner Vassilieff had come to an end after five years, I was training with Victor in Berlin during a time of relaxation and rest after a long period of touring, and I was ready to try something new in my dancing. It was Tatyana’s idea to bring Sascha and me together and to suggest to him to choreograph some duets for us for dance evenings. Sascha was well known at that time. He had danced successfully with Ellen Petz as his partner and had worked with her husband, the famous painter and stage designer Ludwig Kainer. He was a controversial ballet master at the Vienna State Opera, perhaps, best known for his idiosyncratic creation of the role of Joseph in Richard Strauss’s Josephslegende. Sascha began to put together a program for us; in order to compose his choreographies that were full of religious meanings he needed deep concentration, comparable to the concentration required for prayer. I was unfamiliar with the transcendent intentions of his dance style at that time and only got to know them later. As time went on, the work began to fascinate me. His ideas interested Tatyana too and she let herself be convinced by him that he had discovered and recognized a strange new art of dance. I did not know at the beginning that Sascha belonged to spiritualist groups, nor that he was well known as a medium, nor that in certain spiritualist salons on the Kurfurstendamm he had a considerable reputation. Sascha's dancing captivated me more and more, and I could understand the influence he had over Tatyana. I felt that under his direction, I had crossed a frontier to a puzzling experience, a frontier that I would not have been able to cross in full consciousness and would never have done so without him. We worked together for a year, learned and rehearsed pieces together, and performed. Since Sascha was unable to escape the intuitive feeling that his life was in danger in Germany, we lived in Paris. We only appeared in closed concerts and danced for people who, like Sascha, were seeking the meaning of life in contact with the spiritual world, which they were sure existed out there.

In Paris, I understood that Sascha's dances formed the bridge to a sphere of consciousness in which he believed to have developed supernatural capacities and in which he could find contact with other people, their thoughts, and unconscious emotions. He saw the meaning of art precisely in its ability to give him supersensory powers and to allow him contact with the inner lives of others and to remote events. He hoped to develop clairvoyant powers.

In 1931, I was no longer willing to work with him, and wanted to return to my real profession, that of a classical ballerina. We parted as friends and Sascha returned to Berlin, despite his premonitions. I had no further contact with him. When I began this work in 1986, he was among those friends whose fates I wanted to investigate. Sascha was a Jew, and I knew only too well what that meant. Patricia Veroli in Rome put me in contact with Alfred Oberzaucher in Vienna, and through him, I learned that Sascha had died in the Mauthausen concentration camp in 1942. In spite of all my efforts, I have not been able to uncover the circumstances of his deportation and death in that gruesome camp. The Wiesenthal Center in Paris could not help me either. But I still see Sascha before me, fragile, delicate, in his white frilled silk shirts, so afraid of physical pain.

Aurél von Milloss experienced a very different fate, which allows us to see the many-sided character of intrigue. On 15 December 1935, Aurél von Milloss had to leave Diisseldorf and the Diisseldorf Dance Theater, which he had founded and flee Germany in the dead of night. He told me all this in a desperate mood as we met in Budapest in 1937 when I had just escaped Germany myself. For nearly three years, I had been his dance partner and collaborator. His story shows how the Nazis "got rid" of people they did not like. Laban was at that time still the leading personality in German dance active in work commissioned by the Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda. Milloss and Laban had their first disagreement when Laban excluded Milloss and the Diisseldorf Dance Theater from the prestigious dance festival in November 1934. Milloss wrote to Dr. Schlosser in the Propaganda Ministry, but the complaint about Laban made no difference at all. Milloss described the events around his dismissal in a letter to the wife of Fritz Bohme dated 3 December 1935: Since the day before yesterday I am no longer the director of the Diisseldorf Dance Theater, which I founded ... that my enemies could get at me with such despicable accusations aimed at my political and moral behavior ... what a pile of filth was dredged up against me ... I was in the hands of the criminal police who were not able to arrest me ... witnesses, examination. ... not solid ... On 29 November, I received my instant dismissal from the cultural officer responsible for the theaters of the city of Düsseldorf: "on the basis of investigations of the complaints and accusations directed against you, I hereby annul your contract of employment with immediate effect." I think that the accusation was homosexuality. The Gestapo worked independently, outside the institutions. One night after his dismissal, they showed up at his apartment to take him away. He had, however, been warned by telephone and had already fled. His letter to Frau Bohme closed: "My train is almost at the border." As a precaution, he got off the train and crossed on foot through a wood into Holland, "a way my 'secret' friends have shown me."° The whole story went round quickly and was eagerly discussed and passed on; everyone knew about Milloss. Patricia Veroli described the circumstances in which Milloss worked and his escape in her book Milloss. Un maestro della coreografica tra expressionismo e classicità.'° Aurél von Milloss's career nevertheless followed a very different path from those of other émigrés. In 1942 and 1943, he was a guest artist with the Roman opera, the Teatro Reale, and toured in Vienna and Berlin. He was ballet master, director, and sole choreographer at the Teatro Reale. At his express wish and with Mussolini's explicit permission, Stravinsky's Petruchka was included among the works taken on tour"! The Swedish dancer Eva Dahlgren, who danced in Milloss's Roman Opera group for seven years and also toured with him to Vienna and Berlin, writes: "In Berlin, both Goring and Goebbels received him with honors. In Vienna, we saw Jews wearing the yellow star; they looked terrible and were dressed in rags. Nobody in the ensemble dared to talk to Milloss about the political situation and what we saw.""2 Lia Schubert For the second German edition of this book, I included a new story, that of dancer Lia Schubert"? in a country occupied by Germany, in the Vichy-controlled zone of The Fates of Emigrants 49 France. The following description draws from a book about her life and incorporates elements of an interview that I conducted in 1998 in the ballet academy that she runs in Göteborg. Lia or Lea Schubert, ballet dancer, pedagogue, and choreographer, was born in Vienna in 1926. To escape the growing anti-Semitism in Vienna, her Jewish family moved to Zagreb in 1930 and then to Paris. There, Lia Schubert studied as a pupil with Solange Schwarz in the ballet class at the Paris conservatory. Then the war broke out. The Germans were nearing Paris. Like lots of other Jews, we took to the roads, where we tried to survive ... we had to wear the Star of David ... For me, it meant that I had to give up my place at the Paris Conservatoire ... My father was one day summoned to the police station where his residence permit was checked. The next time we saw him was in a small village somewhere in France. He was in a transit camp on his way to an exter-mination camp. The rest of the family managed to get into the unoccupied zone run by the Vichy government. In the end, they too were arrested and brought to Vermissieux, another transit camp in the neighborhood of Lyon. The night before her deportation to a concentration camp, Lia was smuggled out of the transit camp in an ambulance by the Jewish resistance movement. Her mother was drugged with sleeping pills and brought to a hospital in Lyon. Through the help of the resistance movement, she was brought to an old people's home in a small village. There she was supposed to survive the war. It didn’t work out that way. Two Germans were shot in the village. When German soldiers carried out reprisals, they searched the old people’s home. My mother was too weak to maintain her false identity and to tell the story, which corresponded to her forged papers. Somebody told me that she died on the way to Auschwitz ... I don’t know if that’s true or not, but it is plausible. My brother Walter was deported on the same night that I was hidden in the ambulance. There are no indications about his death and after the war I never found his name in any register.

After her flight, Lia began to work actively in the resistance movement but was so young that she was placed in a cloister and told to stay there until the war was over. She refused, and armed with false papers made her way to Marseilles. She succeeded in finding a job as a "coryphée" in the opera ballet in Marseilles. Her luck ran out when in 1944 the Gestapo came for her during a performance. Her colleagues helped her to quickly change and they smuggled her out the stage door. She made her way to Paris to the Studio Wacker on Place Clichy, where the great Russian masters taught, all of whom had been refugees and asked no questions. She was lucky. Victor Gsovsky, one of her former teachers, was there. He needed no explanations to understand her situation. He gave her an address where she could hide.

Later, the fiancée of her brother and friends from the resistance joined her in an abandoned bar. They spent their days walking the streets of Paris because they could disappear in crowds. In the hiding place, they maintained absolute silence. They ate what they could find and shared their provisions. They subsisted on bread with mustard and rolled cigarettes from butts collected on the street. Lia did not dare to train each day, because she had to try to be as inconspicuous as possible. Gsovsky corrected her in whispers when he passed her. Paris was liberated on 25 August 1944. None of her family returned. She was the only survivor.

CHAPTER 5

The Situation in Scandinavia

The Swedish and Norwegian dance communities behaved shockingly badly to their German colleagues who fled Hitler, but a closer look makes such behavior less surprising than it might appear. The recommendation to introduce "racial hygiene" was not an invention of the Nazis. Similar efforts, admittedly in milder forms, had been common to all Western countries in the years since 1900. It was widely believed that the "national popular body" was threatened by hereditary degeneracy, which made acceptable in many societies the suggestion that groups from "genetically inferior stock" be sterilized or castrated. In 1904, the German journal Archiv für Rassen- und Gesellschaftsbiologie [The Archive for Racial and Social Biology — JS] was founded as the organ of the "racial hygiene movements."

Sweden played its part. In 1921, the Rassenbiologiska Institute was founded in Upsala with state funding. Its director, Herman Lindberg, later became a supporter of Hitler. The Swedish institute was widely regarded in Germany as a model of exemplary population politics. Compulsory sterilization was introduced in Sweden and went on for many years, until 1975. Germany was the model for the development of the new, free dance, and consequently, Anna Behles's institute in Stockholm was also constructed on German principles. The so-called bible of the school was called Kroppsutbildning som Konst och Plikt, a translation of the German Körperbildung als Kunst und Pflicht [Body Education as Art and Duty — JS] by FH. The disciples drew their wisdom from this Bible. The Association of Swedish Dance Pedagogues [Svenska Danspedagogförbundet (Sv.D.PF)] was founded on 19 March 1939. For some time, there had been an effort to create an association that would bring together ballet masters, dance pedagogues, and choreographers. Finally, in March 1939, there was a real opportunity to get organized. A number of leading dance personalities went to talk to the state ministry responsible for work-permits (Arbetsviseringen) to put their concerns before them, particularly "to put a stop to the invasion of foreign competitors." The bureau in the state ministry was the Socialstyrelsen.

The new association was able to claim representation of the entire Swedish dance profession, and the state, recognizing its importance, gave it substantial advisory powers in the issuing of work permits to foreigners, putting dance on the same footing as theater and music. Teaterförbundet and Musikförbundet had over a thousand members each, while in its first year, the first war year 1939/40, the dance association numbered a grand total of twenty members, of whom seven were "passive" members who did not take part in meetings but simply kept on the list.

The so-called crisis, "the invasion of foreign competitors," consisted between 1939 and 1945 of a "horde" of precisely eleven applicants, six of whom came from other Scandinavian countries and four from Germany. This so-called "mass invasion" aroused anxiety in the Swedish dance world. The five teachers and dancers began to worry about their own employment and thought they would lose their jobs to the immigrants.

How did work-permit requests and their immediate rejections work out in practice? The first request for an "Arbetsvisering" came from a German national, Marion Sonnenthal, a pianist who worked with rhythmic gymnastics for artistic dance in the Rhythmos Association. The Association's response: "Our association rejected the application and enclosed a letter from the piano teachers. The Presidium of the Association requested an audience with General Intendant Bergquist. The application was refused. We can record our first success, unfortunately, the applicant was a pianist." The Association had made its case and won its first victory in protecting the Swedish dance world from intruders. It would not let any foreigners in and fight every application.

As quoted, the first request for a permit came from a pianist, not a dance teacher. Marion Sonnenthal came with Gertrude (Trude) Engelhart as her accompanist to Sweden. The five members would obviously have preferred to turn down a "proper" teacher first and not only an accompanying musician.

Gertrude Engelhart

When I read the protocols of the Sv.D.PF. in 1987, I was deeply shocked. I knew that Trude Engelhart was still alive, but very ill and crippled. I called her nonetheless and spoke to her about my work and my desire to describe our struggle for survival during the Nazi years. I told her that I had found a great number of documents and gave her a summary of the contents. I asked her why she had fled to Sweden. Slowly and with difficulty, she told me that she had taken over the Wigman school in Berlin after Margarete Wallmann had left Germany. In the Berlin school and in summer courses that she ran in Sweden, she had eventually gathered about ninety Swedish students, the majority of them dance teachers and dancers. They came every year to be taught by her and to disseminate the method of the Wigman school and its dance style in Sweden. “I hate Mary Wigman,” Trude stated that day. “When I was in danger, she threw me out of the Berlin school, which I had run for her.” These were her words, which I wrote down on the spot. Trude was, according to the Nuremberg Laws, a Jewess.

The German national Gertrude Engelhart's application dated 14 May 1940, requested to be employed as dance pedagogue at the Olof School and in the Rhyth- mos Association. After the Sv.D.PF. had opposed it in the most determined way, the ministry refused to grant a work permit. This case did have great significance for the association (in contrast to the permit refused to Marion Sonnenthal), because it was exemplary with respect to the fact that a foreign teacher was prevented from taking her place in the faculty of a state-supported school.

In the summer of 1940, Engelhart's personal friends managed to get the bureau to reverse its decision. The association intervened again and denounced all those "who applied directly or in writing to the bureau and did everything to help this foreigner." Among those who "helped this foreigner" were Jeanna Falk, Gabo Falk and Birgit Cullberg.

The Swedish choreographer Ivo Cramér, who in the 1940s was a pupil of Trude Engelhart, supplied more information and some extra insight. He told me several years ago that Trude had given courses in the 1930s in Tylesand, the well-known Swedish bathing resort. It was Ronny Johansson who invited her. Ronny demanded from Trude a promise not to stay in Sweden. That was the reason for everything that happened later. Ronny was naturally afraid of the competition. She was not a good teacher but at the same time she needed pupils. But the situation in Germany was becoming dangerous. Trude had no other way out and had to break her promise.

I want to re-emphasize that in Sweden, as in other parts of Scandinavia, the new direction in the development of dance that had begun to appear came in fact from Germany. Thus, Scandinavian pupils had made pilgrimages to teachers in Germany in the decades before the Second World War: they had absorbed the impulses and returned to Scandinavia to spread the new doctrines. So it was often the teachers who were seeking refuge and the pupils who were refusing them. The pupils refused to grant them asylum.

On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the Sv.D.PF., the long-serving president of the association, Lulli Svedin, made her position clear: "A few members of the association worked hard to prevent foreign colleagues who ... had fled to us from getting their residence and work permits. It was a normal position of employees to Swedish politics."

Edgar Frank, one of the most talented of Laban's students, came to Sweden in 1937 as a Jewish refugee. He had a short-term contract with the China Variety Theater and had arrived from Norway. He belongs to that group of victims whose suffering and career has proved difficult to document and who were forgotten after 1945 and appear nowhere in the historiography of dance. I met Edgar Frank in 1939 in Stockholm, but at that time, it was dangerous to talk about Germany and one's own position. Maria Kage, an outstanding pupil of Frank's in Stockholm, told me later about his skill as a teacher and about his teaching method. "I am proud to belong to the second generation of Laban pupils; Edgar belonged to the first. "Frank was a famous soloist at the Berlin Opera and, as a Jew, he was in danger. Maria Kage explained: 'There was a group of pupils whom Laban trained. They worked in an open-air restaurant near Munich and practiced every day. It was very primitive. The members of the group were Edgar Frank, Algo, Jooss, Bergeest, and others. There, Laban conceived his earliest choreographies. Frank told me that these Laban pupils formed the first “Master Class,” as Laban called them. They went on tour to Czechoslovakia, Laban's homeland.' They traveled to Bratislava, Poszony in Hungarian, Pressburg in German, Laban's birthplace. Edgar was later a teacher in Laban's main school in Berlin. Maria Kage reported that Frank believed the great success of the tour brought about the establishment of the chain of Laban schools, including the Central School in Berlin.

I asked Maria whether Edgar had told her anything about his dismissal from the Deutsche Oper. She replied that Edgar had never talked much about that period. I only understood that Edgar took a long time to grasp that he personally was threatened and could not see why he had to leave the country. Jooss kept pressing him and said to him over and over again: 'you have to get out of here.' In which year that happened, I cannot say. Jooss took him into his group and Frank danced as a soloist with them. Maria told me in addition that Edgar also remembered his mother with deep love; both of his parents died in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Edgar Frank was terribly damaged psychologically and never recovered to full health, even though he lived to be ninety years old.

In the minutes of the Swedish Danspedagog förbundet [the Swedish Association of Dance Pedagogues — JS] the following entry records the case of Edgar Frank: 'Ref: application of 8 May 1939 by the German national Edgar Levin Frank for a permit as a dancer and ballet master at the China Vaniété: the Association rejects it most emphatically.' The fact that Frank actually got his work permit suggests that the Association's protest arrived too late to affect a decision, which had already been taken.

Elsa Lindenberg Since the name of Elsa Lindenberg appears nowhere, I want to provide a short biography of this dancer, based on information given to me in a letter from Ida Korswold, a close collaborator of Lindenberg, in Oslo. Elsa Lindenberg was a dancer, dance pedagogue, choreographer, and dance therapist. In 1919 she began studying with a scholarship in the 'gifted class' of the Helene Lange school in Berlin. In 1925 she enrolled in the Laban school of Herta Feist and completed her diploma there in 1927. From 1927 to 1933 she danced as a group dancer in the Municipal Opera of Berlin. Politically, Elsa Lindenberg was left-wing and actively fought against Nazism. Between 1932 and 1939 she lived with the psychiatrist Dr. Wilhelm Reich and both left Germany together. In 1933 she was 'removed' from the opera. Formal dismissal took place on 21 April 1933 on the basis of the 'Law for the Re-establishment of the Professional Civil Service.' She was accused of 'activity harmful to the state.' A warrant for her arrest was issued, but before her apartment was searched, Lindenberg and Reich had disappeared. Over the following years the pair were seen in Denmark and on lecture tours elsewhere in Scandinavia. Reich emigrated to the U.S. in 1939 while Elsa Lindenberg went to Oslo in Norway. According to the administrator of her estate, Ida Korswold, Elsa had worked politically with Ruth Abramovitsch, a ballet dancer at the State Opera in Berlin, who herself had fled to Poland and eventually to Great Britain, and with the dancers Ilse Larede, who emigrated to Great Britain, and Julia Marcus, who went to France." A letter that Elsa Lindenberg wrote to Aurél von Milloss, with whom she had studied, is typical of the fate of emigrants to neutral countries: Personally, I have no contacts with the local dancers and theater people, who are all terribly afraid of competition ... and I have only been able to appear on stage as a guest here, although I want to work permanently +53

Elsa Lindenberg belonged to the earliest exponents of modern German dance in Scandinavia. She worked temporarily from 1935 to 1939 for the Arbeiderteatret [Workers Theater — JS] in Oslo. As a result of Gestapo investigations, she had to contract a “marriage of convenience” with a Norwegian. By 1944, she was on the list of wanted people and fled to Sweden, where she hid until the end of the war. After her return to Oslo in 1945, she was persecuted because she was German. Later, the Norwegian government rehabilitated her and she was awarded a state pension.

My Own Case

The rejection of my application, dated 28 April 1943, is couched in the same tone. The justification reads that there are enough equally qualified persons in Sweden. Three people, members of the Dance Pedagogues Association, took part in this decision: Ronny Johansson, who had a career in Germany as a concert dancer; Lulli Svedin, who had studied in Berlin with Trude Engelhart; and Valborg Franchi, who ran the ballet school at the Opera. They knew exactly about the threat to life for émigrés, because they knew the situation in Germany from the inside. It is still amazing to me that a refusal to grant me a work permit and thus permission for permanent residence was taken as late as April 1943, after the battle of Stalingrad. The war was going badly for Germany and public opinion in Sweden was turning against it. The Swedes began to draw nearer to the Allies who would probably win. In spite of that, in that final phase of the war, the tiny bit of personal security that a work permit would have brought me was nonetheless refused.

56 Lilian Karina

What at first I did not understand, I have over the last few years begun to see quite clearly: it was simply fear of competition that moved dance teachers across the whole range of the art to take extreme decisions, which in the end aimed at having the foreigners deported. The chairman of the newly founded Association, Carin Fischer-Hugne, and the members of its executive committee, Ronny Johansson, Jenny Hesselquist, and Sven Tropp, who after 1939 had the right to express an opinion on the applications of all requests for residence and work permits by members of the dance community in all its branches, sympathized with ideas of Hitler and followed the cultural policies of Dr. Joseph Goebbels. Behind each application they scented the hated Jew or communist who they felt had to be expelled from the country at all costs, even if, as in my case, the outcome of the war with Germany was no longer in doubt. The facts to support these accusations can be found in May Wechselmann's very instructive book.84 At the head of the Socialstyrelsen, the state agency itself was Robert Paulsson, who on 8 May 1945, was arrested and convicted of collaboration with the Gestapo. The Swedish Association of Dance Pedagogues was his only advisory agency in the entire field of dance during the Second World War.

CHAPTER 6 Laban's Downfall and Post-Labanism

Laban's Downfall

I want to add some specific material concerning Laban's position in Germany in 1937, in particular a "farewell" letter he wrote to his secretary, Marie Luise Lieschke. For me, this document marks the end of his career in Nazi Germany and the beginning of his emigration. The actual threat to Laban's life cannot be established as yet from the documents. When the Propaganda Ministry refused to re-engage him, did he go right to Jooss? Was he persecuted? How great was the danger to his life? Was there any danger at all? My own view is that in Hitler's Reich, there was always danger to life.

According to Valerie Preston-Dunlop, the archive of Laban's son Roland contains his father's passport, which has a visa and a stamp for a departure from Germany. The date is 4 November 1937. This would mean that even after his "farewell" letter of 3 September 1937, Laban went back to Germany one more time. Laban did everything he could to stay in Germany. If there was a threat to his life, he seems not to have really known it. The fates of Milloss, Gsovsky, Swaine or Leontieff did not interest him. At any rate, I found no mention of it in the private papers, although the danger that arose from being thought a homosexual, even the slightest hint of it, was a suspended sword over many dancers.

Laban wrote the "farewell" letter on 3 September 1937, probably from Berlin, in a fury and full of emotions. He often did not bother to finish sentences and wrote in an abbreviated style. Lieschke, familiar with his personality and work habits, would probably have understood hints and initials of names. The passages marked by letters refer to my comments, which explain the oblique references in the text, and are found in the endnotes. < > in the text means that a passage is not reliably legible.

Dearest friend, I have taken twenty-four hours to write an even halfway civilized letter, one not boiling over with rage and hence lacking the necessary clarity. Among all the other accusations 58 Lilian Karina (aristocrat, money, affairs, etc.) I now hear for the first time and exclusively from you about this Paragraph 175 business.° (It's too bad that I am prevented and have always been prevented—and as a sign of friendship will continue to be prevented—from putting the fist in where it would hurt most.) With Herr Tietjen I never had a single conversation about the matter. My own extremely strict attitude made certain during my years of service at the Opera that not even a shimmer of a hint of anything of the sort among the dancers could ever occur.

When I came to Berlin, Julian Algo had been ballet master elsewhere for years. I met him once by chance in Paris. Herr Tietjen's crass lie° would be at the most a gross act of carelessness if it had happened under my predecessor, Terpis. I don't know anything about that. I always took a humane but socially hostile view of such things and have never had even the slightest hint of suspicion or complaint, let alone a formal process, raised against me. On the contrary, much of the hostility of my pupils (Jens etc)° arose because of my open opposition to such practices.

The thing that most infuriates me is the absolute conviction of Frau W.W [unidentified — LK]. The dwarf Tietjen was in my eyes (...) never a fully paid up human being. Whether Dr. G. [Dr. Goebbels — JS] is telling the truth, that is, whether he is not concealing the reasons for the persecution, which he actually knows, can be doubted or not. He has a lot to do and dance is not so important to him.8° Who is the pig who is plotting against me? That's the question. Cunz was just using the favorable moment and lied like a trooper. But he is not the cause nor the inventor of the scheme. You don't think it's the "system" (Third Reich)! >®? Well, then it has to be a person, who must be unmasked! Not because of me but for the sake of the future of German dance. If it is the System, in other words, if Dr. G. is really such an enemy of our movement choirs and our piece (The Warm Wind), if he or others in a really idiotic way scent Oni- ental Masonic elements in the notation scheme or the harmony-doctrine", then First, the error must be corrected. Second, the man must be informed about the methods of his helpers: a) slander b) destruction of valuable cultural assets?! The prevention of our summer course fits like making a poisoned person vomit. My pupils were Hass, Wienz, Magdeburg, Ellen Tels-Rabitz, Merck (Ballet mistress Dessau). My deficit—at the expense of the Miiller school— RM 400,-. About my way of life you know everything anyway. And health? I come now to the article from Kiel, which I include and send back to you. Hanna <Hass> with astonishment and to my amazement had already sent it to me. For more than a year I had given no interviews and cannot remember a certain Hermann <Kiihne>." Do you think I should write to ask him what all this stuff means? (Skepti- cal people here who read it about a week ago consider it as planted work.) Provocation to harm me and <Hass>. <Hass> wanted to invite me for a lecture and a course—and I wanted from Berlin to report the lecture invitation (as I am duty bound to do) and also that I had received an invitation to direct a performance in Dessau. (With the request for permission in Berlin) wanted to set up a test case to see if I can still work in Germany.) The letter from Ebrecht is my answer. Round by the back, the approval to work is stolen like a thief's accomplice. Who is doing this? So rotten and low. I am ashamed for the first time to be German." Laban's Downfall and Post-Labanism 59 Dr. G. and <N.> must know that. The people should not be allowed to slide around with such practices. The world is full dirt and ill-will but it gets talked about clearly. And it is right that it should. One must not support this spiritual awfulness. Yours is by no means the only warning to get out of Germany and in fact because of my person and not the general situation. I shall try to follow that advice. You may be interested to know that I have been used as an advertisement for the French origins of modern dance. Delsarte will be familiar to you. Here, and not without some justification, people assert that the movement began with him. But Germany had her essence, her original construction, her spirit in this matter (Delsarte was an actor and not a dancer)—if only she wanted it. I cannot defend that view now nor propound it. The whole thing is getting another image, but the thousands in Germany who know the story, must go on believing, go on working, must do their part in a European cause." And especially in Dance which <only> blossomed in Germany." The most respectable motive of my hidden opponents is hostility to my cause. But this too must be expressed openly: hostility to dance as an art and as a language of culture? The only chance I have to go on working for Germany—naturally after clarification and clearing the air—would be the continuation of my dance theater studies in Greece. But how implausible is such a solution. Solution! Sad. Here I am getting along reasonably. | arrived with 10 RM and am still living on that. "Health reasonable." Frau B. to whom I have yet to be able to pass on your greetings will be leaving for Belgrade in the near future, where she has good prospects. 'Trying to run a private school here is as hopeless as it is in Germany. I am moving in the next few days, that is, I am going to my own place (room in a pension). My permit to live from scraps (that is, gifts) I got from the foreign exchange office for a month. I asked for an extension for a few more days. What happens if I don't get it? Then I shall write to the Chamber that I shall come back to Germany to starve. I shall soon apply for a more permanent residence permit here because in a month my visa expires." I get a fair amount of platonic sympathy from my foreign students (although I have not complained). Jooss assures me of his willingness to help but is overburdened "with such cases." But he wrote really very decently. I was astonished. Every friendly piece of news is today a surprise. So, my dear, I should be delighted if you were allowed to touch the keyboard in your choral affairs. It would enchant me if you could uncover the crooks who are determined to get me and our cause by the throat and if you could uncover those who fight so dirty. If you could deliver him to me—without harm to yourself—for revenge that would be lovely. I can't do anything but await your initiative. Any action on my part would burden you in your further success. I thank you for your self-evident trust in me. And then I wish you a little bit of rest and relaxation. It would be nice if you were able to get away for a while. Do you know? I really have to laugh at the way everything in my life is so clear and public. I rejoice that you are always ready to forgive me "everything," even if you have your little suspicions about me. And anyway it's all so plain harmless. Well, it really is whatever the brethren from the nasty brigade think! I embrace you and remain ever your old L.

The first explicit prohibition of Labanism seems to thus be the decision by Goebbels to forbid the performance of Vom Tauwind und der neuen Freude [Of the 60 Lilian Karina Warm Wind and New Joy — JS] in 1936. The rejection of the work has been interpreted by previous scholars as if Laban had somehow never cooperated with the Nazis. He has been portrayed as an innocent victim, indeed as an opponent of the Nazis and their cultural policies. But in spite of the suppression of his work he remained an employee of the Propaganda Ministry until the end of 1937 and continued as the all-powerful director and organizer of dance matters in Germany, although weakened by his illness. He got official approval for his trip to Paris so one can hardly call that flight. He traveled to Paris, stayed with his friend Dussia Bereska, and waited to see how the reaction to the accusations of homosexuality, which could be so dangerous to him, would work out. He waited for the opinions of his friends and considered their advice. At the same time he tried to submit memos and letters to see if it would still be possible for him to work in Germany. The last of his submissions was the application, which he sent to the Reich Ministry directly and which Goebbels personally rejected, in spite of the favorable recommendation of high ministerial civil servants." Bengt Hager told me that in October 1937 Laban received an invitation from Rolf de Maré to give a lecture in the Archives de la Danse in Paris. With that he could provide the Reich Ministry of Propaganda a plausible excuse for his trip. Whether he thought the journey would be his final one remains an open question. He certainly had a suitcase with his most important files and papers, which was seized at the border. Laban told Bengt Hager that the suitcase was deposited for him and was supposed to be handed to him upon his return. Since Laban never returned, it was later sent with its complete contents to Frau Lieschke.

In late 1937 and early 1938, Rudolf von Laban was once again an emigrant, as he had been during the First World War from 1914 to 1918 in Zurich. Post-Labanism
When Laban fled Germany, a new period in the development of his career began. He went to England and joined Kurt Jooss at Dartington Hall. Later, he lived with Lisa Ullmann in Manchester. During this period of his life, he confirmed his status as one of the greatest innovators and analysts in dance history. He transformed himself, as Mary Wigman put it maliciously, from "the priest of an unknown religion" to the founder of a broad and renewed direction in dance.

In the years after his flight from Germany, Laban's students—especially Sigurd Leeder, Albrecht Knust, and Lisa Ullmann—worked out the principles of dance transcription (Laban Notation) and an entire pedagogic system, which was taken up and pushed further by the generation that followed. In this way, the pedagogic applicability could be made more precise and modernized. With respect to the other branches of dance into which Laban had begun to investigate, the disciples provided for a steady growth of knowledge, insight, and transformation into practice.

Laban Notation is today administered by the Notation Bureau in New York and has spread, if in a very elite way, across the world. But the real center of the activities in dance, which Laban initiated, is the Laban Center for Movement and Dance in London. The school explores the many aspects of Laban's work, maintains a training program, and offers courses for interested laypeople and for advanced development, all of which is carried out strictly in conformity with the Laban teaching.

However, there has been a taboo about exploring Laban's relationship to and activity under National Socialism. What did he actually do and say between 1933 and 1937? When anyone approached the subject, it was only to call into question the extent of his free will in the matter, his intentions, and what happened to the dance scene in Germany once he left. Or his attitude to power or to correct or to dismiss as bagatelles his statements and positions. I see an undeniable tendency to ignore Laban's attitude to National Socialism or to provide it with acceptable moral explanations. Hence the birth of this book and our efforts to render to the history of dance the missing and intentionally suppressed facts about the undercurrents of the development of the expressive dance movement.

Gerhard Ebert and Rudolf Penka (Berlin, 1981). The daughter called her father by his first name Johannes. Klamt was the name of his wife, which he took on. Johannes Fischer-Klamt was the only creative dancer about whose death in a concentration camp I learned after the war. He died in KZ Sachenhausen, which the Red Army liberated and then took over. During the last months of the war the family Fischer-Klamt had been evacuated to Plauen. Fischer-Klamt went back to Berlin to look for work. He was arrested on the street, apparently as a result of a denunciation. Ingeborg Klamt told me this in 1989. Delsarte was never in the U.S. It was Ted Shawn who later summed up the method in his book Every Little Moment. In 1970 Kurt Jooss said to me that this book had greatly influenced his choreography. What had most impressed Jooss was the economy of dance-dramatic expression, the economy of the dancers’ gestures. Jooss saw in the Delsarte system the beginning of “free” or “modern” dance, also known as “new artistic dance.” Geneviéve Stebbins was a pupil of McKaye, who had studied directly with Delsarte. She influenced both Loie Fuller and Isadora Duncan. See Eurhythmie (Stuttgart, 1975), which contains contributions by Otto Wiener about Marie and Rudolf Steiner. The Koch Group was composed of male and female dancers, who were well regarded artistically. They appeared in their dance evenings completely naked. Nakedness was supposed to demonstrate their absolute freedom and the equal status of the sexes. Hungarian modernism was translated into dance by Aurél von Milloss after 1936 but was suffocated in its infancy by fascism and war. See Patricia Veroli, Milloss.

This view is important in the history of dance, because Elizabeth Duncan's husband, Max Merz, was a disciple and follower of Chamberlain.

The first wave left Russia immediately after the revolution; the second wave was composed of the fleeing and defeated White Russian armies. At the beginning of the 1920s, they succeeded in getting to Western Europe via Yalta and Constantinople and then scattered across the world. Among them were young soldiers, cadets, and officers who had dancing training. My own dance partner Vassilieff, and Boris Kniaseff, Alicia Vronskaya, and Konstantin Alperoy, not to forget the Don Cossacks and other choirs and dance groups, belonged to this second wave of Russian émigrés.

18. Paragraph 175 was widely known in the dance world as the “gay paragraph.” Even Laban knew that he had to leave Germany if he were to be accused of homosexuality. He was afraid that he might become the victim of a nasty conspiracy. Paragraph 175 had been transformed in 1935 from a relatively liberal version into a brutal instrument of Nazi population policy. By 1937 a denunciation even without any evidence was enough to endanger a person’s life. Once in a concentration camp, the victim was beyond justice, even Nazi justice. (See Die Geschichte des Paragraphen 175, (Berlin, 1990), p.105 and p.110. Laban suspected that Goebbels would use these charges to get rid of him.
19. Laban’s hatred of Tietjens, the director of the State Opera, may have contributed to his failure at the State Opera.

Please note that the text provided is still not perfect, but it should be more readable and accurate than the original.______ He was too busy with the press, radio, and film. Later, Goebbels showed his interest in the art through his intervention against Laban and Lieschke. Laban himself did not doubt the ideology of Nazism at that time. This accusation has its own history, and Laban seems to have forgotten his own past on Monte Ver- ita in the years 1914-1918. I see in this the roots of the aversion that the Nazis had for Laban and for Mary Wigman. Laban suspected it but did not want to admit the truth. He must have known that all sects had been forbidden in 1936 because of the forms he had filled out. Laban's notation was certainly in its origins influenced by his plans to found a free Masonic lodge. Hugo Ball has called it "hieratic" [cf. Hugo Ball, Lexikon priesterlich ritueller Schrift and Suzanne Perrottet, Ein bewegtes Leben]. Laban was very impressed with Schénberg's new harmonic doctrine and called it in the presence of his pupils an occult science. Early sectarian impulses can be found in other dance literature of the time, so for example in Fritz Bohme's Entsiegelung der Geheimnisse. Bohme found the origin of the re-emergence of faith in a secret script in early Christian magic. Laban was for a while strongly influenced by neo-Platonism. His "Ikosaeder" ("Icosahedron"), a so-called "Platonic body," was designed by him to show the directions of human movement. The interest in hieratics and graphology was also part of the times. Calligraphy was an important form of Dadaist expression, among them Hugo Ball in Zurich. Ball showed a great interest for Laban's choreo- graphies and schools. Laban called some of his schools in Zurich "gardens." Ludwig Klages' graphology was involved with the Rhythmus movement, and the "Thule Society", a militant anti- Semitic lodge, numbered Hitler, Rosenberg, and Hess among its members. Guido von List provides another link to the later Nazi ideology and the symbolism of written signs. Hitler and Hess are said to have been his pupils. List wrote voluminous works about the magical meaning of letters, especially those of the Nordic runes; in 1907 he published a book on the secrets of the runes. It was List who founded the "Germanic Order" in 1914, whose members had to swear an oath that they had no Jewish blood in their veins. Cf. Das Neue Lexikon der Esoterik. (Munich, 1993 and 1995). Laban's downfall arose from the fact that he entered into competition with the Führer Adolf Hitler. Laban saw himself as a "leader blessed by grace," which led him to trouble. His collaborators recognized that sooner than he did. Laban then woke up and got out, but not before testing the terrain to see if there was a chance to find work worthy of him in Nazi Germany. His requests to Schlésser and Cunz were such tests, but they failed. In October 1937 his application to the Ministry of Propaganda to continue was rejected. This term "cultural assets" [Kulturgut in the original - JS] shows how much Nazi ideology Laban had absorbed. In the years before the Nazi period, he had understood his work, his method, and his analyses in "cosmic" terms; he felt himself in contact with the universe. The interview that Laban mentions, was written by Hermann Kiihne. This interview with Kiihne, which Laban gave him on the occasion of the Olympics in 1936 can be found in the Bundesarchiv Potsdam in a folder of newspaper clippings submitted to Goebbels. Laban was Hungarian by birth, by profession an officer. (See Collection Rudolf von Laban, Tanz- archiv Leipzig, Rep. 028 Ia | Nr.1) Since he spent the war in neutral Switzerland, he must, in effect, have been a deserter. Hence he may have been stateless in 1918 because he chose not to go back to Hungary. During the Nazi period, he applied for German citizenship. That was the emphasis of his confession of faith. This state was extremely subjective. Laban called the style, which he developed, simply “dance” and paid no attention yet once again to the other highly developed dance cultures (of which many had been suppressed). Anybody who was not traveling on official business could only take 10 RM out of Germany. I could not find out if that was why Laban returned to Germany. I think that he wanted to make one last try to speak personally to Goebbels. He wanted, in that way, to secure for himself a leading position in German dance affairs. According to Bengt Hager, Stockholm, a close friend of Kurt Jooss, Jooss loved and honored Laban, his teacher, and was ready to do anything for him.

This section, with the support of the Documentary Appendix, reconstructs a period of dance history that has been widely neglected, even avoided: the adaptation of the art of dance to the ideological and political system of German Nazism. It would be impossible to deal adequately with the entire process of the adjustment of dance to the new regime. I therefore concentrate on one important and representative area: the cultural policies of the Reichsministerium für Volksaufklarung und Propaganda, the Reich Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda (henceforth RMPEP) and the documentation that it generated.

The records in the Documentary Appendix—letters, file memoranda, marginal notes, applications, denunciations, newspaper clippings and draft ordinances—were primarily taken from holdings of the Federal Archives in either Potsdam, Berlin or Koblenz. They illuminate some of the central developments that were instigated by the Reich Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda concerning dance during the Third Reich. The concentration on written evidence from the archives of this ministry arises from its function: in Nazi Germany, the Propaganda Ministry was the central directing and final decision-making organ in all cultural questions. The Reich Culture Chamber (RCC) was directly subordinate to the Ministry. Some of the documents from the RMPEP, especially those created in the administrative area of Hans Hinkel, Reich Controller of Culture, are now found in the Berlin Document Center. These documents generally concern individuals: creative artists who for one reason or another were considered important for the development of the arts in Germany or civil servants who worked in the various departments. Notes for this section begin on page 150.

Marion Kant

The archival collections of the Propaganda Ministry in the Federal Archives are by no means complete. No state organ ever keeps perfect records of every piece of business, but German archives particularly suffered because air raids did so much damage in 1944. The Propaganda Ministry, the German Dance Theater, and the Master Workshops of German Dance were hit and burned out during the raids. Large gaps appear in the documentary records, which cannot be filled by other sources. Nevertheless, enough remains in spite of the missing pieces to provide a plausible account of developments. It is possible with the surviving holdings to trace the most important stages and processes in the evolution of dance politics. The records illuminate a past that the post 1945 survivors did their best to conceal. It is not a pretty story. The evidence describes intentions, goals, decisions, judgments, administrative measures, rejections, and approvals, but it also sheds light on personal behavior, intrigue, maneuvers, resentments, influence-peddling or fawning, patronage, and favors. Above all, the documents uncover where responsibility and irresponsibility lay. They embody an ideology to which dance became subject. They illustrate how that ideology penetrated and pervaded dance policy and practice. They reveal the helping hands that were readily available to integrate dance into the National-Socialist system. Lastly they show how this mixture of politics and culture actually worked and display its features. It was an amalgam formed by the totalitarian claims of the Nazi bureaucrats on the one side, and the egoistic, ambitious, blinkered, nasty, and not infrequently self-serving acts of the artists on the other. None of this says anything about the artistic quality of what was created; in these papers, we are confronted with personalities in structures; we gain an insight into the psychologies of artists acclimatizing to and accepting the Nazi regime and the changes it implemented in all walks of life. The documents disprove the legend that dance was somehow overpowered and coerced into co-operating with the Nazis. Never have artists been more amenable and in a greater hurry to offer themselves to the powerful than German dancers were under the Nazis. These were not helpless artists exposed to the machination of dark forces. They did not simply react; they acted. The main risk to which they were exposed was being shoved aside in the race for power, place, and approval by the Nazi State. They bear a historical responsibility for their acts. However one judges these acts of the dancers who collaborated so cheerfully with the Nazis, however one judges their behavior and attitudes,—the issue of moral judgment by historians is not a simple one—it cannot be said that they did not know what was happening or that they were somehow not involved in Nazi barbarism.

The archives have little to say about what dance actually looked like. Only rarely do they discuss the aesthetic criteria, which might be demanded of, or imposed on, dance. These particular documents instead direct attention to certain focal points of politics, cultural politics: sometime in relation to special persons; sometimes in relation to special decisions or events. The artists who appear more frequently than any others in these records are Rudolf von Laban and Mary Wigman. That is hardly surprising, as these were the two figures who most decisively influenced modern German dance history. Nobody disputes their enormous impact on the progress of German modern dance but almost everybody denies the reality that these documents uncover: their pre-eminent importance in the politics of dance under the Nazis. This is not surprising either. Both Laban and Wigman survived the war and had the strongest possible motives for covering up their compromised pasts. Besides, as the two demi-gods of modern German dance, they have devout disciples; these worshipful followers then and now simply refuse to see the dark stain of brown on the pure white robes of the spotless creators of the art form. The disciples turn away; they do not want to know the truth. It is as if somehow to take account of the contradictory and complex realities of their careers after 1933, to acknowledge their enthusiastic collaboration in the bestialities of Nazism, calls the whole enterprise that has grown out of German modern dance into question. Only if these figures are declared unsullied, can the art form be preserved without blemish. Yet Wigman and Laban lived a very different reality from that imagined by the devout disciples. The complexities and ambivalences of their work for the regime tell a much more interesting story of the relationship between art and politics than the sanitized orthodox version. The nuances go from the noisy assertiveness of the top people to the traditional other-worldliness of the artist, from contempt for the bureaucrats and their pettiness to enthusiastic participation in state administration, from objects of political manipulation to active subjects doing the manipulating. The lingering concentration in this study on specific events in the Third Reich happened not by itself but through the attempt to construct a coherent account of dance history in the years from 1933 to 1945. The focal points and centers of gravity emerged from mountains of paper in the various archives. This was, only a short while ago, "dead" history. The events were suspended in the documentary record, which in turn turned dance into documents. In the pages that follow, I want, above all, to create a working model of a particular historical situation, which will serve as a precondition for finding out what actually happened, to whom, and possibly why. This exercise has not been done before. The specific events of the period, set into the actual structures of the epoch, will sharpen the focus in the history of dance. Precision will replace vagueness, and reality will disperse legends.

The State of Dance Research

The previous historiography of dance has been fragmentary. Dance was exempt from the same scrutiny that the other main art forms underwent, and for which the collapse of the Third Reich initiated an intensive process of self-examination and reconsideration in terms of their relationship to National-Socialist policies and practices. In the postwar decades, there were no attempts to reflect on dance politics and dance aesthetics under the Nazis. On the contrary, a legend gradually formed, which was neither investigated nor questioned. The legend covered the past with a blanket of oblivion: there had been, it seems, no modern dance under the Nazis, just a bit of ballet at the most.

Modern German Dance, the so-called Ausdruckstanz, Expressive Dance, it was claimed, belonged to the great tradition of the artistic avant-garde in the early twentieth century and hence was by definition progressive. Like all the progressive art forms, it was assumed and then taken for granted that modern dance had been unwelcome in the culturally reactionary Nazi world of the arts. It was simply unimaginable that an art form that had gained its legitimacy under the Weimar Republic, could lose that legitimacy in collaboration with the Nazis. So the transition from one stage to the other was simply not imagined because it was believed unthinkable.

Nothing was said about any possible links between modern dance and the totalitarian state and the ensuing silence allowed all sorts of imaginary pasts to be substituted for the uncomfortable but real one. It is, after all, only the past—history. Who cares now about the past? Some say we can learn from history; others feel that we need to work through and overcome the past, still others think that remorse or regret makes history more acceptable, more manageable, better able to prevent a recurrence of catastrophe.

Does it matter if we concern ourselves with history and, in particular, with the history of art? Does dance have a history? Even if it does, does it make a difference to our understanding of the artistic creation? What is the relationship of the artist to his or her creations? Can the artist be made responsible for their uses? Is society responsible for them? There are two extreme positions on the issue of art, in this case dance and politics. One states that the political system has nothing to do with art or artists, because artistic creation is and has always been utterly independent of the regimes or ideologies under which it is created. Art exists for itself and needs no other external justification. This view has always had strong advocates and has them today in the world of dance. On the other extreme are those who believe that art reflects the economic, social, and political circumstances of its birth, that it is always political and always under the influence of the conditions in which it arises. The extent to which the artist can act independently divides the advocates of this view. As soon as one moves away from a rigid causality, the issues of freedom and responsibility emerge, and the view arises in which artists have freedom of choice and are morally responsible actors. Here again, opinions divide. For some observers, great art exempts the artist from the normal categories of moral judgment; for others, the artists remain responsible not only for the art but also for the subsequent consequences, uses, and misuses of their work. This can be summed up in what Nietzsche called “The ‘Wagner Case’ and periodically reappears when Israeli orchestras propose to play his music.

More narrowly, opinions divide even on the issue of context. What difference does it make to a choreographer what sort of regime operates the theaters and what sort of dance has official approval and which has not? This issue in the perpetual debate about art and society concerns us here. Dancers, ballet masters, choreographers, theater managers, composers, stage designers, and critics found themselves in a much more intrusive world after 30 January 1933, the day Adolf Hitler was named Reich Chancellor of Germany. The state did not just demand an unequivocal declaration of loyalty to the new regime but insisted that the citizens declare their allegiance to the new National-Socialist ideology. Germany became a Führerstaat, a state in which, as learned jurists explained, Hitler's will made law and replaced the sovereignty of the people or any more traditional legitimacy. Laws, decrees, ordinances, jurisdictions looked at first as they always had, but at their base lay a new arbitrariness, whose limits in 1933 were clear only to the insightful, the pessimistic, and the fortunate. The pressure to conform was there from the beginning.

How real it was and how thoroughly it was enforced depends on historical opinion and divides the profession. Many dancers were activists in the National-Socialist movement, and many dancers decided that they had to bow to the new ideology; this acceptance of a higher authority became, in time, the core of an apologia that survivors used to justify collaboration after 1945. It was the choreographic equivalent of the alibi offered by officers in the Wehrmacht: we only obeyed orders. Others played the innocent apolitical role: what did we, simple dancers, know about affairs of state; what have we to do with the atrocities of the regime? This takes us back to the initial question of whether art is, or is not to be considered a political matter. Evidence in the archives suggests that the story is complicated. As National Socialism developed into a modern regime of the masses, it found the overwhelming majority of the dance community eager and willing to contribute to the new mass movements, in the literal sense, of helping to choreograph movements of masses. They subordinated their artistic criteria to the needs of the new state.

Was all this really, as they later claimed, an unwilling execution of a distasteful task? Or should one simply shrug it off as an "exception," a nasty period when, of course, art had to be produced for an all-consuming state and can therefore simply be dismissed (Bad states produce bad art, so let us get on with the study of what happens when free states let the arts develop freely)? This question is more complicated and much more interesting than the apologists would have us believe. Just as Nazism had long taproots in German history and did not appear like a genie from a bottle, so German modern dance had its own historical baggage, which it carried into the new regime and for which to its surprise it suddenly found a new, receptive, and apparently infinitely powerful patron. This fascinating, uncomfortable association goes beyond what has passed for dance history in the period. Up to now, a real history of dance under the Nazis has not been written. There are a few studies on dance and Nazism, individuals during the Nazi period, a few choreographers and dancers. Some attention, and it is little, has been given to the fate of the emigrants, the persecuted and the murdered. In general, the accounts of victims have not been written in the context of the general history of the Third Reich but, remained within the framework of their individual stories. No systematic explanation has been offered for the apparently inexplicable ill treatment that dancers and people in the dance world suffered.

The present study represents, therefore, just the beginning of a serious reconsideration of an art historical complex, which begins with an account of dance history during the Nazi regime and attempts to set the record straight on the main features of the developments during that period.

Dance in Germany in 1930

The story begins with the situation in Germany at the beginning of the 1930s. There were two camps in the dance world, which were fiercely opposed: on one side there was ballet, the art of dance, practiced in theaters, and on the other, modern free dance, which had been gaining in importance and support since the beginning of the century. Both camps embodied an a priori aesthetic and artistic program. Ballet, on the one hand, lived on its romantic inheritance from the nineteenth century and had obtained a formal codex of movement and a systematic structure of training and exercise. On the other hand, it underwent continual renewal from within, it explored the limits of its own legacies and constantly crossed borders. The protagonists of ballet’s renewal were, for example, the Ballets Russes or the Ballet Suédois, both, to be sure, not at home in Germany, but in Paris. But ballet, whether modern or traditional, always remained within the framework of theatrical performance.

Modern dance rapidly found a home in Germany and there acquired its characteristic features as Ausdruckstanz, expressive dance, sometimes also known as New Dance or Free Dance or New German Dance or Central European Dance. It claimed to have burst the restraints of all previous theatrical norms and rejected traditional forms as coercive and narrow. It proclaimed the liberation of the body and thus of the person. Ausdruckstanz derived its ideas by negating the characteristics of ballet as well as its entire history. Isadora Duncan, Mary Wigman, and Rudolf von Laban came to represent the move to liberate dance from antiquated and tedious conventions.

By 1930 ballet and modern dance had clashed repeatedly and the confrontation had become unusually bitter. Rudolf von Laban had made an attempt in the 1920s to organize the expressive dance camp structurally and artistically. That turned out to be harder than he thought because the movement lacked homogeneity and resisted centralization. The claims to leadership within modern dance were rapidly contested and Laban and his former pupil Mary Wigman became the two leading antagonists. There were also considerable differences in the readiness of different schools and groups to recognize dance as a social reality. According to Mary Wigman and her circle, dance had to be “absolute,” and thus an art free of the impurities of the vulgar world. Where left-wing critics and trade unionists asserted that art expressed the relationship of the artists to the means of production, “absolute dance,” Wigman believed, expressed timeless truths about the human condition. The economic depression worsened the desperate situation of dancers of every persuasion and intensified the struggle for survival among all branches of the art. Laban organized several congresses of dancers, in 1927 in Magdeburg, in 1928 in Essen, and in 1930 in Munich, but these gatherings merely showed how polarized even the modern dance groups had become. Calls for a “national” and a “racial” Introduction 77 renewal of dance were beginning to be heard. The explicitly German aspect of Aus- druckstanz became one of the central aesthetic objectives of the creative dancer and was accompanied by a rejection of “other,” alien influences. The adoption of “Ger- man” and “absolute” as the two dominating categories of modern dance meant to sev- eral influential dance critics the decline of new German dance. One of the most important forums for articulating any kind of critique was the journal Der Tanz.3 In the years 1930 to 1933 this dispute, which went well beyond purely artistic issues, was vehemently carried on, until the Nazi assumption of power on 30 January 1933 brought all such debates to an abrupt end.

CHAPTER 7
The Reich Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda
The Foundation of the Reich Culture Chamber
O. 13 March 1933, the Reich Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propa- ganda was created and Dr. Joseph Goebbels was named its minister. Hitler instructed Goebbels to take complete control of all cultural and intellectual activities of the Reich. The Propaganda Ministry was in charge of all communication media, and all artistic production, reproduction, and distribution, with its central mission to gener- ate a flood of propaganda to support and strengthen the regime. Not only was every artistic act or creation to be closely supervised for subversive tendencies, but the RMPEP saw itself as the source of creative energy and direction for the whole world of the arts. Propaganda and art—were they to condition or to exclude each other? The National-Socialists saw art as propaganda and propaganda as a form of art. Art had to serve to convince the German nation of the goals of the national revolution and it had to ignite their enthusiasm. In September 1933 the RMPEP received authority by law to set up the Reich Culture Chamber. Goebbels received additional authority to issue laws and regulations that he judged to be necessary to enforce the Reich Cul- ture Chamber law. All participants of those activities that fell within the responsibil- ities of the RMPEP, that is, all practitioners of the arts, had to join publicly established corporations of culture creators.4 The Reich Culture Chamber had seven functional subdivisions, which covered the main artistic fields: the chambers for fine arts, film, literature, music, press, radio, and theater. (The existing Reich Film Chamber and the Reich Theater Chamber, which had been founded a few weeks earlier were simply absorbed and integrated into the new structure.) Each chamber corresponded to a department within the Propa- ganda Ministry. Departments VI and X, the sections responsible for music and theater, determined the fate of dance in the Third Reich. The Reich Ministry for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda 79 Joseph Goebbels as minister of propaganda became ex officio president of all seven chambers. Guiding directives and ministerial decrees were now centralized in the Berlin headquarters but also extended by a structure, which covered each tradi- tional German region or “Land” and each party district known in Nazi terminology as the Gau. Both regional administration and party bureaucracies in the districts obeyed directives and guidelines issued from the center through the local offices of the Reich Propaganda Ministry. The so-called Reichspropagandaamter, the local offices of the RMPEP, were originally simply regional offices of the Ministry but in September 1937, they were elevated to the higher status of Reich agencies. This organizational structure and way of functioning involved a centralized steering mechanism in the Ministry and executive organs in the regions, such as the Landeskulturwalter (Regional Culture Curator) and regional directorates for the local branches of the Culture Chambers. It continued unchanged through May 1945 and the end of the regime.

The Reich Culture Chamber issued "official communications," in which laws, formal guidelines, notices of expulsion or cancellation of membership, and administrative decisions were published. The individual Culture Chambers published their own very similar official gazettes, which appeared regularly and which promulgated the relevant announcements for the particular artistic activity controlled by the specific chamber of culture. For dance, the official gazette was at first the journal Der Tanz and later the Die Deutsche Tanzzeitschrift. Goebbels' National-Socialist artistic policy had a financial side as well, and the Reich Culture Chamber had the power to set budgets and control expenditures in every branch of art. Its first and most pressing task was to "aryanize" all branches of culture. In order to be able to generate truly, racially pure German art, all "artfremde Elemente" (elements alien to the species), especially Jews, had to be eliminated. Goebbels never tired of emphasizing this priority. Jews were the German misfortune, and the Jewish element had to be exterminated in German art and culture to free them from the Jewish plague.

Rivalries about Culture and Art

The Goebbels Propaganda Ministry was only one pillar of the new racial cultural establishment. As is true in all political systems, there were competing claims by other agencies to control the cultural life of the state, claims that led to considerable conflict. The peculiar structure of the Hitler regime made these battles unavoidable and more intense, and they continued to rage even as the institutions themselves turned into rubble in 1945. As Peter Reichel puts it, in spite of all the efforts "by the Nazi regime to achieve a unified control of state, society and economy, it never succeeded. There was never a system of rule, which functioned in a rational, frictionless centralized manner, guided by the Führerprinzip, [the system of absolute dictatorial control in every agency, firm or unit by its chief, of which the Führer's authority as law-giver and decision-maker was the supreme model — JS]. The dominance of the party, its Führer, its ideology and its comprehensive propaganda apparatus never achieved really coordinated control." In fact, the vertical system of decision-making prevented compromise at lower levels between competing agencies and pushed decisions up the chain of command to the very top. Unless Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels, Speer or Goring made a decision—and in very grave issues if Hitler failed to resolve conflicts at the apex—the battle raged on. As General Georg Thomas, head of the war economy and armaments office, described the functioning of the Nazi State, "here there rages the Hobbesian war of all against all." The realm of art and culture was not exempt from these turf battles. Ideological battles, real or occasionally mock ones that tested the field, continued from 1933 to 1945. Goebbels and his opponents clashed again and again. They understood culture very differently and sought to realize sharply conflicting aesthetic objectives. Frequently the issues could not be resolved and the battles ended in a temporary truce, only to burst into flames again at a later date and place. Goebbels literally fought everybody about everything. His position as minister of propaganda and cultural tsar provoked controversy and dissent. He had influence but never achieved immunity from criticism.

"As minister he had in theory almost comprehensive state powers. As president of the Reich Culture Chamber Goebbels had a not inconsiderable right of control of professional accreditation and acceptability, which ran from the star conductor to the box office staff. And as Reich director of propaganda he commanded a post of great authority within the party hierarchy ... but he never built his own private empire."

The structural uncertainty, which grew out of his lack of his own real source of power, forced Goebbels into compromises and alliances that he would otherwise not have chosen. This political weakness made Goebbels more dependent on Hitler's will than his competitors and explains several unexpected, illogical, and inconsistent decisions, especially in the field of the arts. The arts, and artists, were extremely important as propagandistic tools, but they could easily be sacrificed to a higher course if need be; or they could be exchanged as pawns in some kind of deal or power game.

Goebbels's greatest rival for direction of cultural policy was Alfred Rosenberg, whose book, Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts (Mythus), was second only to Hitler's Mein Kampf among the fundamental ideological texts of Nazi doctrine. In it, Rosenberg constructed a racist scale of cultural values within a wider worldview based on an extreme version of racial theory. Rosenberg attacked Goebbels and his cultural policies more or less continuously.

From 1929 onwards he directed the Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur (The Fighting League for German Culture). The Kampfbund aimed to create the racial and national foundations for culture and its supervision. Rosenberg was also primarily responsible for the NS-Kulturgemeinde (National-Socialist Cultural Community), which he used incessantly to try to dismantle the Reich Culture Chamber. He failed in this and suffered the indignity of the withdrawal of the NS-Kulturgemeinde from his control because the organization had fallen into serious financial and economic difficulties. Rosenberg thus lost not only one of the largest public organizations but also control of one of the most important direct instruments of influence on cultural development. The NS-Kulturgemeinde was then subordinated to the German Labor Front under Robert Ley, another one of Goebbels's rivals. Rosenberg did not give up and gradually found his way by the back door to a new position in cultural politics. In January 1934 he was made leader of the Amt für die Uberwachung der gesamten geistigen und weltanschaulichen Schulung und Erziehung der NSDAP (office for the supervision of the entire intellectual and ideological education of the NSDAP). In spite of his new post, he never quite succeeded in wresting control of cultural policy from Goebbels, but he used his new post to introduce difficulties and friction, which he accomplished by undermining the standing of leading artists. The struggle for control of culture and artistic policy between Goebbels and Ley was eased when the professional organizations of artists were conceded to the Reich Culture Chamber and the Propaganda Ministry. Another rival, especially in theatrical questions, was Hermann Göring, who considered himself responsible for several state theaters and operas. Goebbels had to fight Göring for repertoires, casting, and programs. Conflicts continued and affected the arts, including dance. The Propaganda Ministry and the Reich Theater Chamber sought control over the cultural world and the business side of the arts. Division VI of the Ministry—Theater—dealt with dance. The famous German bureaucratic thoroughness knew no limits in its will to control theater arts. Division VI—Theater was divided into seven sections: 1. Personnel affairs, 2. Reich Dramaturgy, 3. Dance, 4. Theater budgets, 5. Organization, 6. Theater law, 7. Theatrical affairs abroad. The Reich Theater Chamber had the task of conveying cultural decisions and supervising their implementation. The most substantial Fachschaft was for the theater, the theatrical stage (German term "Bühne"). It consisted of eight artistic areas, one of which included theater dancers. Alongside the Stage Fachschaft were units for dance, circus, and street artists with their corresponding legal departments, opera, as well as professional associations and corporate members. The Dance Fachschaft broke down into two functional divisions: art dance teachers and school directors on the one side, and social dancing teachers on the other. The "Law of the Reich Culture Chamber" and its implementation regulations determined the tasks of the various chambers, including the Reich Theater Chamber. The law specified that "the Chamber was to promote German culture for the benefit of the people and the Reich, under the leadership of the minister of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda. The goal was to regulate the economic and social affairs of the cultural professions and to achieve a balance among the efforts of all those engaged in its various branches." [14] The law aimed to advance German art and culture, while also meeting the economic and social needs of those practicing these professions.

The political, ideological, social, and economic interests of art professionals were to be protected, but only when they accepted the total claim to authority of the National-Socialist State. The interests of the German Volk came first, and the Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda conveyed and expressed those interests in National-Socialist Germany. If the artistically active and creative individuals accepted this fundamental premise, they would be granted protection of their economic and social interests in exchange.

The mutual relationship between artistic and material needs, which were tightly tied and impossible to separate, secured for the Propaganda Ministry through its organs, the Reich Culture Chamber and the Reich Theater Chamber, immense power over the arts and fused areas in the arts that had hitherto been independent. Wage, hour, and pension demands that were previously the job of trade unions now became mixed with artistic-aesthetic criteria. Artistic and working conditions became utterly dependent on each other and on the political-ideological worldview of National Socialism, which represented the necessary starting point of all artistic activity. Critical or analytical art could now be easily eliminated; art became the confession of a faith. This was the perfect beginning of the "ideologizing" of art and the "aestheticization of politics" or the "theatricalization of politics." [10]

The Reich Ministry for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda remained in many passages imprecise and unclear. The execution of the laws thus remained a matter of the interpretation of a vague and ambiguous text. Interpretation opened the door to utter arbitrariness in practice.

The decisive second paragraph defined membership of the chamber. In principle, every person who had anything to do with art or culture had to join the relevant chamber. Nobody was supposed to be prevented from producing artistic creations, but only those whose works were judged to be in conformity with the spirit of National Socialism could expect to see their work performed or displayed. One of the most important preconditions of membership was the Ariernachweis [proof of Aryan racial origins -- JS]. That requirement was not spelled out in the law but in one of the directives of the Propaganda Ministry. [4] The guidelines of the law set the boundaries for artistic and theater politics within which they had to unfold. The 1934 Reich Theater Law made the boundaries more explicit. The law covered the entire range of theatrical activities. At the beginning, it applied only to a part of the arts of movement, that class of creative dance that worked in the theater or the opera. With the founding of the Stage Fachschaft in 1935, the first phase of the Nazi takeover of the arts was brought to a close. The process of selection and coordination involved in its establishment was necessary to enforce the guidelines of the Reich Culture Chamber, the Theater Law, and the countless decrees and instructions that flowed from the authorities in the following years.

The Theater Law abolished all previous employment legislation, personnel regulations, the direction of repertoires and programs, and the structure of trade union organizations. The Führerprinzip [the style of leadership which Hitler embodied — JS] became mandatory and gave to the Propaganda Ministry complete dictatorial authority over the theatrical community and its institutions.

“All theaters within the territory of the Reich are subject to the direction of the Reich Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda and its respective minister with a view to the fulfillment of their cultural objectives.”'” The direction and administration of theaters had to take place “in ethical conviction and in consciousness of national responsibility” and “in trustworthiness.” National responsibility and trustworthiness would be defined by the Propaganda Ministry. Artistic personnel were sworn to “true obedience.”!®

Admissions to the professions were to be regulated by the Propaganda Ministry and/or the Reich Theater Chamber. Not only were appointment and dismissal of theater administrations and to some extent artistic personnel reserved to the Propaganda Ministry, but also the interpretation and performance modalities of individual scripts lay under its control.

“The engagement of stage directors, intendants, theater directors, principal conductors, and senior stage managers requires confirmation of the competent minister. The minister may extend this oversight to other groups of persons fulfilling artistic functions at his discretion. The minister can exercise the power in general or in specific to require or forbid the performance of specific pieces, if in his sole discretion he considers it necessary for the fulfillment of the cultural objectives of the theater.” '?

84 Marion Kant

These laws and directives that regulated specific aspects of theater and the performing arts in the broadest sense had a counterpart in general Nazi legislation, of which by far the most important was the notorious “Law for the Re-establishment of the Professional Civil Service” of 7 April 1933. The law aimed to “cleanse” (in other words, to purge) the civil service of “racially undesirable elements” and political enemies, and was widely used in theaters and opera houses.

CHAPTER 8

The Nazi Redirection of Dance

Dance politics did not begin with the founding of the Reich Culture Chamber and its ordinances and directives. Many dance artists had not needed the legal framework to execute the will of their new masters. They knew what the regime expected and hastened to anticipate its wishes. The spectacle of this mass conversion to Nazi values by just about the entire dance community in Germany still shocks the observer even after sixty years. Only a handful of dancers, who were not directly threatened by the racial laws and political discrimination, resisted Nazism. On the whole, there was not a word of criticism, not a sign of regret, not a whisper of sympathy for their unfortunate "non-Aryan" colleagues or the victims of political persecution, not even a twitch of conscience. Mass opportunism seems to have swept the dance studios, and within weeks, the most famous dancers and choreographers were shoving each other to the side in their indecent haste to serve the new regime.

It is hardly surprising that the biographers of the great figures of German dance—Laban, Wigman, Palucca, Kreutzberg—have drawn a veil over this inglorious spectacle and simply omitted the story from their hagiographies. In spite of its eagerness, the dance community faced a variety of uncertainties in their quest for acceptance by the Nazis. It was not entirely obvious how dance could be incorporated in the great revolution inaugurated by the Nazi seizure of power. And it was not instantly clear who the most important masters were in this new world. The proper structure had to be considered, and it was not immediately evident. Who was to run what?

Dance had to overcome its traditional marginal status as the expendable art form. The regime clearly had its eyes on mass movement in the literal, physical sense of moving masses. Was this the way up for German modern dance as the choreographers of the mass movements? Dance had to overcome its historic fragmentation into hostile camps: social dance, folk dance, art dance as German dance (Ausdruckstanz), and ballet, theater dance. The divisions were not exclusively a result of differing performance and artistic attitudes; the animosity between Ausdruckstanz and ballet had ideological origins. In the following years, this conflict was to have very serious consequences.

Marion Kant, The first organizational scheme foresaw dance as a whole subsumed into the organization for music. The dancers rejected that, as it happened, so did the Ministry. The problem of finding an appropriate bureaucratic category for dance sheds an interesting light on the preoccupations of the new regime, a mix of extreme arbitrary violence and equally extreme bureaucratic precision.

The civil servant in the Propaganda Ministry, Otto von Keudell, who was responsible for various administrative issues in the arts, made a note on 9 September 1933 that the Reich Dance Fachschaft could only be recognized via the National-Socialist Teachers' League, from which it could then enter into, for instance, a working alliance with novelists and poets. Otto Laubinger confirmed this view on 1 October 1933: "With respect to information conveyed from the N.-S. Teachers' League and in conformity to the views of Minister of Culture Schemm and Oberegierungsrat Ebner, all the teachers of dance as a Reich Fachschaft are to be organized in the N.-S. Teachers' League. Once the organization has been carried out, the Reich Dance Fachschaft, in my opinion, can enter into a working partnership with composers in the Reich Music Chamber." He even toyed with the idea of securing dance teachers a place as part of the lay participation movement planned for the Theater Chamber. The new state had to find just the right organizational structure for every aspect of culture. Laubinger hesitated to impose a solution in 1933 in spite of his urge to see everything neatly put into its bureaucratic box because he had to await the final formulation of the Reich Culture Chamber Law and its provisions for the dance teachers and creative dancers. In the end, the law established an independent Fachschaft and subordinated it to the Reich Theater Chamber. This unexpectedly positive development for the world of dance, however, created a new set of bureaucratic issues. Administrative integration of dance as an art form into the total Nazi State required more than a unified structure; it involved a complex and tedious process of definition of the many facets of dance as a professional and amateur activity. How should the whole range of dancing be arranged to permit that bureaucratic ideal of unified, uniform, transparent, regular, hierarchical, and controlled artistic activity? A complex and fluid set of activities must be turned into a single current at the service of the new regime, and that raised the really fundamental question of the purpose of dance and its social, cultural, and intellectual significance. This was a really sticky problem. Beyond certain generalizations about the nature of dance, there were no accepted categories by which to define its meaning and purpose, let alone the boundaries among its various artistic manifestations. How could this messy reality be neatened up and made serviceable to the Nazi State? Could there be "Nazi dance" and would all the warring factions be equally welcome under the swastika and be centrally administered? Was the first step to create a unified, widely accepted and centralized "idea of dance" that would provide the intellectual categories by which to assess the complicated realities? Or was the best plan simply to drape the ideological banner over what actually went on in the real world?

Certain branches of dance were relatively unproblematic. Social dance and folk dancing could remain within their customary confines. Nobody considered it necessary to provide either with new significance. The only problem was to expedite the Gleichschaltung [the contemporary term for the redirection of every activity along the track set by the Nazis —JS] of the existing dance teachers and to expose them to Nazi ideology. Their present organizations merely had to be "nazified" by expulsion of non-Aryans and by acceptance of the autocratic Führerprinzip in place of all consultative and elected forms of decision-making. There was no artistic problem in either case. In these branches of dance the new regulations followed a pattern of external conformity. The profession was to be "cleansed" of "alien racial types." At this stage the dances in the repertoire and their content attracted little or no comment. Attention fell on the visible and obvious "cleansing" actions. Un-German sounding names and titles were adjusted in order to maintain repertoires, which were being offered anyway. A few questionable works were quietly dropped and dancers went on dancing what they had performed before 30 January 1933. Great speeches and professions of loyalty or new inner commitment were, of course, made all over the theatrical world, and these should not be considered merely lip service or opportunism. Most of them were deeply sincere and reflected a vigorous willingness to serve the "revolution." But at this stage, they had no aesthetic consequences. The formal organization and techniques for social dance changed scarcely at all. The teaching system was modernized but not fundamentally changed. Social dance teachers could now enjoy a much more comprehensive training. They were to observe Rudolf von Laban's definition of "the German in Dance" and in this context they had to establish a dividing line between social and folk dance or to decide to abolish such divisions. Once the waltz had been declared as an authentic German dance, the discussion died down and was not carried to its end. In the end, folk dancing, even German folk dancing, played a subordinate role on the list of organizational priorities of the Propaganda Ministry in spite of the massive propagandistic use of the form itself. It had no significance for art dance in spite of the occasional reference to certain physical movements or aesthetic citations. Even committed theoreticians of folk dancing could not achieve the creation of a new Nazi dance practice, which would ensure the extension of folk dance beyond its conventional boundaries. Oddly enough, the Nazis were not really very interested in folk dance beyond the scope of certain rituals like the annual harvest thanksgiving festival at Bückeburg. It was only performed in restricted dance circles and had no meaning for other groups. In spite of an ideological tendency to “blood and soil” rhetoric and “folkish” ideas, folk dancing was little more than window-dressing for the Propaganda Ministry. Insiders took a cynical, instrumental view of it. Herr Doktor Goebbels had no urge to hop around in a dirndl nor were his “educated” civil servants likely to do so either. That kind of stuff could be left to Rosenberg. They took it seriously when either folk dance or social dance was the vehicle through which jurisdiction might be contested or a rival agency might make a grab for control of some bit of culture. As a result, a National-Socialist “take-over” of both types of dance took place without much friction. Dance teachers did not wait for the laws and regulations of the Reich Culture Chamber to reorganize their activities, and as early as spring and summer of 1933, Marion Kant proudly presented their associations as disciplined unities under unified command. The last uncertainties and a few lingering areas of resistance were definitively swept away by the establishment of the Reich Theater and Reich Music Chambers. Social dance teachers saw themselves as bearers of a certain, very German culture, which they transmitted through their profession, and they happily settled into their niche as part of the Dance Fachschaft in the Reich Theater Chamber, whose leader was August Burger. Two actually very different groups were assigned to the Fachschaft. Group 1 contained all school directors of dance schools, dance pedagogues, podium dancers, dancers in dance groups, leaders of movement and dance choirs and choruses, choreographers and directors of theatrical dance. To this mixed bunch, the Reichsbund für Gemeinschaftstanz e.V., the Reich League of Community Dance was added. Group 2 was composed of all teachers of social and ballroom dance, together with its national organization, the Reichsverband zur Pflege des Gesellschaftstanzes e.V., the Reich Association for the Cultivation of Social Dance. At the same time, stage and theatrical dancers were organized into the Stage Fachschaft. Prior to the establishment of the “Stage” group, theatrical employees in general acquired membership in the Reich Theater Chamber by a collective inclusion in the Deutscher Chorsänger und Tanzerbund, the German League of Choir Singers and Association of Dancers. Rudolf von Laban directed the artistic committee of the unified association. The real difficulty lay in the treatment and placement of “art dance.” All forms of dancing, including the “free” dance practitioners, had several organizations. They had to be united or persuaded to form unified bodies. The many groups, clubs, guilds, etc. reflected the deep ideological and economical division of the dance scene. Only ballet dancers had some hierarchical structures and titles, which reflected the practices of the German theatrical establishment and the traditions of opera houses in which ballet had a fixed place. Modern German dance, the so-called Ausdruckstanz or expressive dance, defined itself less as an art form than a rhythmically marked movement towards a utopian model of society.

As early as 1910, Mary Wigman had been attracted by the Garden City movement.28 In Dresden-Hellerau, she lived in a commune dedicated to the achievement of social harmony through the freedom and harmony of the individual. Mary Wigman, with Rudolf von Laban, later moved to the Monte Verita, the mountain of truth, in Ascona, where they both sought perfection in a vegetarian, occult, anarchist community. As "natural human beings," they and their followers practiced a reformed lifestyle. Laban called his enterprise there a "school of art." He proposed to induct his disciples into new forms of harmonious and simple life and to penetrate all manifestations of human genius in search of the underlying unity.

Some artists in what they believed was the rhythmic movement of the "German" spirit merged their anti-bourgeois and anti-modern social visions in a higher reality. German expressive dance was now to be "the expression of German sensibility and German character" in the sense of National Socialism. It was "to baptize the German people in energy and rhythm, which will transmit the inner equilibrium to the experience of community and communion of all the members of the Volk." In that way "the rhythmic factor" would open "his [the spectator — MK] soul" and form "a racially directed attitude."27 All this would help to achieve the National-Socialist community, the so-called Volksgemeinschaft, through dance, for "German art dance was from the beginning a community art form, an artistic precursor of that Volksgemeinschaft, which has begun to realize itself in these days."20 A gradual withdrawal from social questions and political realities became easier as the dance community drew nearer to Nazi ideals and worldviews.

The aesthetics and programs of the German artistic dance groups now more than ever excluded from their activities any contact with ballet. They drew a sharp line between their German Tanzkunst, the real "art dance" and Kunsttanz, conventional theatrical dance forms. The German Dance movement had made it clear during the 1920s, and with increasing aggressiveness, that it was the true "art dance," and not merely physical drill or acrobatic exercise like gymnastics and old-fashioned ballet. The concepts of Theatertanz (theatrical dance) and Tanztheater (dance theatre) were other manifestations that showed the division between the dance camps. German dance claimed to be an art as opposed to the declining or decadent dance practiced in opera houses.

In 1928, during the Tanzerkongress in the city of Essen, Laban, Wigman, and Jooss presented unusually striking versions of their ideas on the future of dance. Wigman's propositions were by far the most radical. In "Der neue künstlerische Tanz und das Theater" [The New Artistic Dance and the Theater —JS] *, she apodictically spoke about her "absolute dance" as the dance form of the future. "Absolute dance," she insisted, was not theater dance; it was not dance intended for the theater. The following text is OCRed from a book.

Opera houses and theaters needed to be reformed before they would be able to integrate "absolute dance," dance determined by movement only, that real expression of modernity. Ballet belonged to a past age and should be banned from any contemporary theatrical establishment. The theater had to be awakened from its "pseudo existence" before it could become the grand symbol of life which modern German dance had already become. As of now, theaters were not acceptable either as architectural spaces in which to perform nor as institutions to which young dancers should be exposed.

Later, in the same congress in 1928, Laban lectured on "Das chorische Kunst-werk" [The choric art work — JS]>, which he saw as the means to liberate theater. He substituted theatrical dance with his notion of community dance; choral works executed by amateur or professional dance choirs would celebrate the true spirit of the community. The translation of physical activity into a spiritually heightened being, the soulful embodiment of the principles of togetherness, would constitute the basis of future social structures. Movement choirs for Laban were the piece itself, the organizational frame, and the process by which the individual could integrate into and learn how to operate within a group, the community. Ideally, the movement choirs would be performed not in theaters but in dance temples. Community dancing was education, the tool towards a goal: a unified order in which humankind would live a harmonious life with nature and ascend from an undesired reality to an ideal, utopian, and truthful being.

He ignored the historical significance of the theatrical tradition and Marion Kant demanded that it be liberated from its past, thus denying it not only a past but also a future. Though Laban's plea seemed less rigorous and extreme than Wigman's harsh conclusion, both agreed that ballet had never undergone any kind of development, had not reacted to modern demands and notions of modernity. More important, though, was his strict vision of a community dance replacing art and society.

Whereas both Laban and Wigman had planned a dance without theater, Jooss created a structure in which the opposition between dance inside and outside the theater was broken down; he moved towards a practical synthesis of both principles. Jooss offered what he called an "objective basis ... for practical artistic questions." First, he said, it was necessary to examine the terminology, "theater dance" and "dance theater," which he found unhelpful. He made it quite clear, though, that Wigman's "absolute dance" could not and should not be the measure of all dance. On the contrary, he saw "absolute dance" as a subcategory of theatrical dance; together with the requirements of the stage, and only when filtered through the necessities of the very real and realistic theater would it merge into his "Tanztheater." He also discussed the structure and function of the institution of theater; for him, it was the starting point of all future artistic activities. Above all, a reality such as the theater had to be acknowledged, not condemned; one had to work with and not against a historically grown organization.

The three concepts could not have been more different. They mapped the German dance landscape. All three positions had supporters, but in the end, it was Laban who managed to gather the majority behind him. After Jooss had left Germany and emigrated to England, there was nobody prominent who would have been prepared to defend a position that aimed for compromise. The following text is OCRed from a book.

With Laban and Wigman at the forefront and gaining favor with the Nazi administration, the question was no longer ballet or Ausdruckstanz (expressive dance), but which kind of Ausdruckstanz. Thus, the question of the future of National-Socialist dance was tied up with the struggle for dominance of one dance form over the other and one artist over the other.

The Propaganda Ministry was the most important arena for this modern guerre des buffoons. The trouble was that the internal organization of the Ministry was so chaotic in the early stages that clear victory for one form or the other could not be declared. It is likely that, had the dance theorists and choreographers not made such a fuss, the bureaucracy would have lumped all the forms of dance into a group within the structures designed for theaters. In another possible outcome, the whole quarreling lot might have been shoved into the Reich Music Chamber and there lost all independent identity. But there was a fuss, loud and insistent. The dancers of the new and free-dance style demanded to be recognized as an independent art form entirely separate from theater, opera, music or literature.

It must be repeated once more: the self-regulation of the entire dance community according to National-Socialist criteria took place in parallel to the gradual organization of artistic regulation by the Propaganda Ministry and was not ordered by the state or the various new culture chambers. The enthusiastic self-nazification, which the documents in the appendix record, anticipated the state regulation of culture and was absolutely not a result of coercion, pressure or threat. Creative dancers fell over themselves in proving what enthusiastic Nazis they had all become. The social-dance teachers were among the most eager to show their Nazi convictions. Their public energy and loud manifestations forced other groups of dancers to get into line as well and sped up the conversion process. Snobbery played a role. The grand figures of the opera or the gurus of the new German dance could not allow themselves to be shamed by the lower orders to which ordinary social-dance teachers clearly belonged.

Hence all the claims and counter-claims, rivalries both personal and artistic, of the entire dance world ended up in bureaucratic battles for jurisdiction in the Ministry and in the culture chambers. The agencies of the Nazi State and Party had their own agendas and jurisdictional disputes. The Fighting League for German Culture (Kampfbund für Deutsche Kultur), the National-Socialist Cultural Community (NS-Kulturgemeinde), the German Labor Front (Die Deutsche Arbeitsfront)*4 and various ministries fought their own turf wars in tandem with equally violent struggles among the dance groups. This Hobbesian war of all against all, so characteristic of the Nazi State, involved dozens of agencies, party groups, associations and ministries. In the dust churned up by the jurisdictional disputes it became hard to see who had allied with whom and to what end, on what terms, and for how long. One example, the Fighting League for German Culture,”? will serve as illustration. The League had a section for body education [Korperbildung — JS] and gymnastics. Rudolf Bode ran one of the most famous schools of gymnastics in Germany, started the organization, and thus became leader of the new section for body education and gymnastics in the Fighting League. In November 1933 he staked his claim by publishing an article entitled “The Spiritual Foundations of Body-Education and Dance in the National-Socialist State,” which was published as a separate pamphlet and reprinted in the leading dance magazine, Der Tanz. In the article Bode set out the stages and tasks in the transformation of German body education and dance into genuine expressions of the new regime. A “healthy energy of the Volk” and the “unified movement” must penetrate gymnastics and dance, he demanded. A bodily/spiritual reality—not to be confused with thinking—must be generated for Germans, which would tap the “origins in the German womb and German bloodstream” of the essential life forces of National-Socialism’s worldview and rules of life, which themselves emerged from blood and soil.

In his willful and mystifying Germanization program, Bode reserved a special place for dance. Dance took in principle two ways to express itself as part of the “healthy energy of the people.” One was energy “discharge” and the other the “streaming binding.” “The male discharges energy in dancing movements,” he proclaimed. Bode meant leaping dances, stamping, and pounding rhythms. The “streaming binding,” on the other hand, “expresses the outlet of swinging movements. Their deeper rootedness in the rhythmic circulation of all life forms manifests itself in the free soaring movement.”*° Bode offered no aesthetic conception nor even an action program but only murky, blurry, apparently impressive 92 Marion Kant metaphysical nonsense. The one clear point amidst the babble was the demand to avoid any return to the artificialities of ballet and to prevent any “weak, slack, posing” that passed for artistic dance.

Bode convinced various dance groups to join the Fighting League very quickly, and he successfully drew others close to the organization in different ways. In June 1933, all the Aryan members of the General German Union of Dance Teachers, one of the most important organizations of its kind in Germany, were advised by Bode to join as corporate members.?® At the same time, the Reich Association for the Cultivation of Social Dancing joined the Fighting League. On the other hand, the German Body-Education Association, represented in the Fighting League as a group led by Gustav Joachim Fischer-Klamt, decided to join the National-Socialist Teachers League in order to preserve its interests among teachers. Fischer-Klamt was a considerable prize. He co-directed with his wife Jutta Klamt a large dance school in Berlin, and his organization numbered 400 schools. The Klamt School was acknowledged as the headquarters, a so-called “central school.” Fischer-Klamt made a name for himself by being the first to introduce “racial studies” (Rassenkunde) into dance schools.

The Wigman, Palucca, and Triumpy dance schools joined the National-Socialist Teachers League and the Fighting League in July 1933 and agreed to enforce with great severity the so-called “Aryan paragraphs” in membership applications. They urged all their students to follow suit.?? With these voluntary actions, the most important modern dance schools in Germany had undergone an entirely voluntary Gleichschaltung [the contemporary term for the redirection of every activity along the track set by the Nazis — JS] to position themselves and their directors completely at the service of the new regime. The Fighting League next tried to use its leverage with the dance associations to gain influence in the Propaganda Ministry and in this way to get its ideological premises into the decisions of the cultural bureaucracy. In the process, they went too far. In autumn 1933, the leadership used the occasion of a dance festival to suggest that the Propaganda Ministry had, in effect, already approved the Fighting League's program. The Propaganda Ministry reacted vigorously and demanded a retraction. It had by no means arranged or supported the dance festival. The imputations by the Fighting League were presumptuous and impermissible intrusions into the work of the Ministry.¹ Fischer-Klamt recognized that there had to be a better way to infiltrate the Propaganda Ministry and gain influence. He saw more quickly than his rivals that the N.-S. Teachers League would be integrated into the Reich Theater Chamber and so very quickly offered his cooperation to Laubinger. He prepared suggestions for a general set of regulations for examining and admitting members to the profession as dancers and pedagogues. In November 1933, Fischer-Klamt greeted the president of the Reich Theater Chamber with a hearty "Heil Hitler!" and assured him that "he would be more than delighted if through your great interest in dance as an art form, consideration of our purely artistic activity, especially the issue of our dance congresses, could be taken up within the Chamber."²

The Nazi Redirection of Dance 93

Fischer-Klamt also opened a third avenue by trying to win the patronage of Dr. Goebbels himself for a dance work by Jutta Klamt called Volk ans Gewehr ["people to arms!" —a popular Nazi slogan of the time — JS]. It claimed to be the first really German dance work of the new era in Germany and destined to be a sign of the change and thus worthy of the highest support. The Propaganda Ministry was, however, not willing to recognize the signals Fischer-Klamt had given because it would elevate one dance direction above all the others.² Not yet at any rate. The Klamt family had to wait several years before it could enjoy the favor of those on high.

In spite of being put into its place by the rebuke from the Goebbels Ministry, the Fighting League secured for itself the loyalty of a great number of the most important figures in modern dance such as Dorothee Giinther from the ‘Triimpy School, Gret Palucca, Mary Wigman, and theorists like Fritz Bohme, who was a leading dance critic and theorist of German dance, Hanns Hasting, accompanist at the Wigman School, Walter Schénberg, accompanist at the Klamt School, Albrecht Knust, a pupil of Laban and one of the cofounders of "Kinetographie" now widely known as "Laban Notation," a system for transcribing dance movements; and many more. In spite of this glittering support, the Fighting League was unable to gain influence on the next stages of the decision-making. Goebbels would not want Rosenberg's force to infiltrate his Ministry. The Propaganda Ministry had to fight off other claims as well, and it had to manage the battles between the groups it had meanwhile gathered under its roof. The struggle over the ultimate integration of the members of the N.-S. Teachers League and the professional schools went on much longer and came much closer to the heart of the matter: dance training depended on the principles of dance itself and thus affected its very essence. Whoever set the parameters and principles of dance training had the power to determine the entire development and direction of the art form. All the government agencies seem to have realized that training was the central issue. Each desperately tried to ensure that it won control. The Goebbels Ministry faced off in the first instance against the Reich Ministry of Education, Science and Volk Education, and the Prussian Ministry of Science, Art and Volk Education (Ministerium für Erziehung, Wissenschaft, Kunst und Volksbildung). The Reich Ministry of the Interior also reserved its right to be consulted. It was only with the establishment of the Stage Fachschaft that the conflicts gradually eased, at least in part, although they continued into 1936. It had certainly cost the Propaganda Ministry and the Theater Chamber a considerable effort to get their views accepted. In practice, there was no reason in principle why the schools could not have been assigned to one or the other of the education ministries or indeed some other, very different organizational arrangement could have been worked out.

The civil servants in the Propaganda Ministry recognized that their victory involved them in the vexing task of thinking out an overall structure for all the different and squabbling branches of dance, which now included all sorts of dance teachers, all the various dance schools, every kind of professional dancer and choreographer. Nothing like it had ever been tried before. The paradoxical outcome was that dance had to be seriously defined, demarcated, and ordered within the bureaucracy of the state.

Within the exclusive ideology of the National-Socialist State, to design an artistic conception tended to mean an ideological choice or selection to the exclusion of all others. If one artistic conception achieved the favor of the mighty figures of the regime, it would claim exclusive control and all other currents would be simply marginalized. Should Ausdruckstanz, the dance form that understood itself a priori as the German form of dance, win the existential battle, it might mean the temporary eclipse of ballet. If ballet won the battle, theater dance would remain the primary manifestation of dance. Whatever the "other" might be—and this was inherent to Nazi logic—it could not be allowed to co-exist. Every indication during the first few months of the regime confirmed that reality.

Ballet had advantages in the struggle. It could count stable traditions and a functioning infrastructure. Ausdruckstanz had the right ideology and had made its claim on "modernity." The ideal case might have been a fusion of the two styles, but this was unthinkable, not least because the protagonists on both sides flatly rejected it, but also because Nazi ideology forbade "both/and" solutions in favor of clear "either/or outcomes."

The Plan for a Nazi Dance Policy

What seems to have happened, according to the surviving documents, is something like this: while the jurisdictional skirmishes were going on, a few civil servants in the Ministry began to sketch the outlines of a dance policy. In August 1933, Dr. Niedecken-Gebhardt was invited for this purpose because of his "great expertise" and to contribute to the "urgent and necessary clarification of outstanding dance questions." He was to comment on six position papers embodying various solutions and to freely comment and criticize. (The corresponding documents are, alas, not in the existing ministerial archives).

To charge Niedecken-Gebhardt with the task amounted to a choice in itself since he was a director and theater personality of great standing, and a close friend and admirer of Mary Wigman and through her well known as "a friend of dance." "Dance" here meant not any or all kinds of dance but that of Wigman, the German variant of modern dance. Niedecken-Gebhardt had as early as 1920 made opera history by replacing static choruses with movement choruses. This "friend of dance" was to distinguish himself several years later as the director of the German Master Workshops for Dance. A few months after Niedecken-Gebhardt's engagement, on 8 November 1933, Fritz Bohme, a dance critic and promoter of dance in the Laban style, wrote an explicit letter to Reich Minister Dr. Joseph Goebbels. He urged the minister to declare dance a fully established art form, like the others, and presented an unique opportunity for National Socialism to encourage a modern art form that already had racist principles and ideas in its very substance. This would be useful to both sides. Bohme not only set out his ideas about the importance of dance but also suggested a division between the two main currents of art dance, which in the end was in quintessence adopted.

Bohme divided dance into two categories: 1) self-danced forms - folk dancing, social dancing, and 2) performed dance - theater dance, podium dance, variety, and cabaret. Both were to be examined for racially pure and racially alien elements and when necessary, fully cleansed of contamination by the latter. Bohme declared his fundamental view in the lapidary statement: "dance is a race question. There is no international, supra-racial dance form." In addition to preserving the essence of German dance, there must also be a thorough clean-out of the sphere of outmoded dance criticism. Criticism still lay in the hands of Jews who inevitably favored racially alien forms and rhythms.

When Bohme suggested the creation within the Reich Culture Chamber of an eighth section, one for the arts of movement, he followed Laban's ideas and concepts and laid out his visions of dance in Germany. Von Keudell asked the minister in a note in the margin of the letter whether he thought the creation of an eighth chamber, as suggested by Bohme, in effect, a professional category for dance, was conceivable. Should it be located in the Reich Music Chamber or if not, then where? Or should one let folk and social dancing be represented in the Reich Music Chamber and stage dance in the Theater Chamber? The ballet, which had for a century refined its international character drawn from French, Italian, and Russian traditions, had often been attacked by representatives of German dance well before the Nazis seized power. Among the attackers was Mary Wigman, who confirmed her hostility in a series of articles in 1929 and then in her book Deutsche Tanzkunst (German art dance). Bohme had even asked in one of his articles if ballet could be considered a German art at all. Like Klamt and Wigman, he concluded that it could not. Ballet, they all agreed, emerged from the Latin and Romance cultural traditions and was therefore un-German and antithetical to the German character. It is not known if Fritz Bohme ever got a chance to expound his ideas to Goebbels in person.

We do know, though, that Ministerial Councilor von Keudell, whom we have discussed earlier, wrote a memorandum in July 1934 on the history and significance of Ausdruckstanz. He made the distinction, by that time absolutely standard among exponents of German dance, between ballet and German dance. To use catchwords like expressionism or cubism to describe German dance, he argued, was simply nonsensical and in no way justifiable. Ballet lacked spirit and showed stylized figures. Ballet schools were run by foreigners. Ausdruckstanz, on the other hand, was in the sense understood by Nietzsche the art of the moved and moving, dancing German human being, the medium by which the educated body became the instrument to draw forth the depth of the German spirit and its deepest emotions. In the Third Reich, German dance could serve to shape festival and holiday ceremonies. It represented in a particularly marked way the life rhythms of the new Germany.

Von Keudell had the names of those artists in hand who embodied the four great German dance schools: Wigman, Palucca, Laban, and Giinther. They must be favored in the way the conductor Wilhelm Furtwangler had been. Then one would be rewarded with correspondingly brilliant performances. Von Keudell went beyond mere complaining about the neglect of German dance. He offered a set of measures, which the Propaganda Ministry could easily carry out by executive orders. They ranged from simple public commitment to German dance by the Propaganda Ministry and the Reich Theater Chamber, through instructions to theater intendants to employ more German dancers and to engage more art dancers in German ballet companies. He proposed that dance criticism be "cleansed" according to "German" criteria and more daringly that the Ministry construct a national schedule of examinations and qualifications for German dancers. He also urged that the four leading schools be massively subsidized and that German dance, especially those exponents of it whom he had singled out, be offered the opportunity to create a great work and to show their full potential. The best way to do that would be to found a specially designated German Dance Theater in Berlin. The new theater could show its works for the Olympic Games in 1936.

Later in the month, von Keudell followed up this grand plan with a set of detailed proposals and cost estimates. In August 1934, the suggestions and the financial estimates were approved by State Secretary Funk, Ministerial Director Greiner and Ministerial Councilor Ott. Von Keudell could now begin the transformation. This meant that Rudolf von Laban, genius of modern European dance, and Mary Wigman, creator of the German modern dance, had broken into the leading circles of the Nazi State. Laban, the influential personality in the League of Choir Singers and Association of Dancers, was already known and trusted in the Propaganda Ministry. He was regarded as ready and eager to undertake a responsible position under National Socialism. Gret Palucca and Dorothee Giinter were, to be sure, recognized as important artists, but they lacked the artistic vision of Wigman or the wide experience and international significance of Laban.

That too was recognized and accepted in the Ministry. CHAPTER 9 Ministerial Dance Politicos—Rudolf von Laban and Otto von Keudell

Who was this von Keudell, who declared Ausdruckstanz to be German dance as such, indeed to be the dance form of the National-Socialist movement, who received the recommendations and suggestions of the expressive dance community but rejected with such certainty the ballet as a relevant art form? Where did he get his ideas and how did he have such authority?

Otto von Keudell, born in Rome on 23 February 1887, had been a civil servant in the Reich Ministry of Interior and had risen to the senior rank of Ministerial Coun- cilor. His views were conservative. We know that in 1925 he joined the right-wing Deutschnationale Volkspartei [the German National People’s Party, the respectable branch of right-wing conservatism — JS]. He joined the Nazi Party after the seizure of power on 14 March 1933 and belonged to that group of opportunists whom the contemporary wits called the “Mdirzgefallenen” [“the fallen in March,” a pun on those who died in a particular month of the First World War but used also for those who joined the Nazi party in March 1933 shortly after the Nazi seizure of power — JS].

Two weeks after his conversion to Nazism, he was transferred from Interior to the new Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda at the express and urgent request of the minister himself, Dr. Joseph Goebbels. He was assigned to artistic and theater problems and especially dance questions. Von Keudell became an enthusias- tic interlocutor in dance issues and joined wholeheartedly the camp of German mod- ern dance, accepting without reservation the superiority of Ausdruckstanz and Laban’s theories and the practices of Laban and Wigman.

Von Keudell was the link between the Ministry and Laban, which over time became a genuine friendship. In the vertical structure of the Nazi State, von Keudell provided a form of patronage, which had important consequences. Since von Keudell understood and accepted the need to revalue dance in general and modern dance in particular, he could find ways to smooth the path of modern dancers, to find money and to support programs. In effect he made the favored style of dance into the preferred expression of the art form 98 Marion Kant within the state. He set the priorities within N.-S. dance policies and these priorities assured German modern dance a special place in the new regime.

The ideas, which von Keudell carried out, however, stemmed from Rudolf von Laban, who became the dance strategist of the National-Socialist state. Rudolf von Laban was by far the most important figure in modern dance in Ger- many. His role as the “father of Ausdruckstanz,” the creator of a variety of schools and theorist of dance, cannot be denied. Laban’s stature in modern culture can justly be compared with his contemporaries in other fields like Arnold Schénberg in music or Vasily Kandinsky in painting. Like them he created a new artistic system, a new system for dance, but he also conceived a new way of seeing the world. His signifi- cance rests on his theories through which an entirely new and hitherto unimagined cosmos of dance was created. Laban was the initiator of a certain type of modernity in dance. Just as all other radically modern movements of those years, it behaved like the avant-garde it was. Parallels can be found in literature, music, architecture, painting, and theater. There we see the same gestures, the same bohemianism, the same contempt for the bour- geoisie, the same rejection of the conventional and the same disdain for the traditional. The modern movements all set out to shock and soon became officially “degenerate” once the Nazis came to power. After 1933, the little theaters closed, the writers emigrated, the painters and poets withdrew, and the architects lost their contracts. Dance alone survived and prospered. Laban’s and his pupil Mary Wigman’s avant-gardism was not forbidden nor denounced as degenerate. On the contrary, this form of the modern flourished. It became official state art, organized the new regime’s choreography, and turned into a weapon in the ideological battle to impose Nazi “blood-and-soil” ideals and racial politics on German society and then on the world.

To understand dance politics under the swastika, the strange career of Rudolf von Laban as a “German genius” needs to be examined. When Rudolf Laban was born in 1879, Bismarck’s Second Reich was a mere eight years old. Laban was born in a remote place from the powerful, new united Germany, in a provincial capital in the disintegrating, recently defeated, Habsburg Monarchy. The place was called Pressburg by German speakers, Poszony by the Hungarians, and Bratislava by the Slovaks, which became its capital later. Laban belonged to an Imperial and Royal catholic, military family. His father was stationed in various, remote parts of the Kingdom of Hungary, which stretched from eastern Austria into the Ukraine of today, and from the northern border of today’s Republic of Slovakia deep into the troubled zones of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The family had no German ancestry, and the mother’s background was unclear. Laban asserted that his father had ancestors who were French Huguenots, presumably driven from France after Louis XIV revoked the edict of Nantes in 1685.

Laban chose to become the founder of a self-consciously German art form, despite having no claim on a German identity. He was only granted German nationality in 1935. His background raises the interesting question of what might have caused such a man to found an entirely new direction in dance and to call that new direction “German”? The answers are not easy to find. Laban concealed in his autobiographical writing both the facts about his origins and the ideological process by which he came to hold his ideas. He omits the simplest and most basic facts about his first thirty years for reasons that still need to be explained by further archival research. Laban’s evasions have served his disciples well. He springs fully armed from the head of Zeus, a universal genius without origin or culture except that which he creates. The adoring standard biographies of Laban scarcely mention the first thirty years of his life as if his cultural formation and national identity were trivial and irrelevant aspects of the great man’s identity. In so doing the biographers miss the most interesting aspect of that identity: its artificial, self-conscious and constructed quality. When Laban chose to be "German," he chose to be a particular kind of German, to embody a very special strand of German culture, and to situate himself in a very particular place in the German cultural landscape. He chose Germany because Germany offered him something essential to his work. To see how fundamental that choice was, we need to retrace the vicissitudes of his life before he settled in Germany insofar as it is possible to reconstruct them: the catastrophes of war and the revolutions of Central Europe between 1914 and 1920, the collapse of the Habsburg Monarchy, the fall of an entire social structure in which the Labans had a place, and the disintegration of a multinational state structure.

During the First World War, Laban, who had been trained at the Vienna Theresianische Militär-akademie from 1898 to 1900 to be an officer in the Austro-Hungarian or Royal Hungarian Army, refused to answer the order to report to his unit. He was a deserter in 1914 and by 1918, after the collapse of the Danube Monarchy, stateless and exiled. He shared that status with hundreds of thousands of others in the post-1918 world, hordes of people without a valid passport. He depended on the League of Nations, whose passport office in Geneva supplied rudimentary documents for the displaced thousands who needed to travel.

The question—which nationality to choose?—was thus not just a cultural affinity but a matter of life and death. His decision to go to Germany brought practical problems in its wake. He could certainly travel on a League passport, but to live and work in Germany, he needed all those stamped documents and permits that continue to make the lives of immigrants and asylum-seekers miserable. The fascinating thing is that Laban only actually became a German citizen in 1935, two years after Hitler had seized power. The choice of Germany was, thus, not natural or even very practical. He had a right to be Czechoslovak, because he was born in Bratislava, as it became after 1918. He certainly had a claim to be Hungarian, although he might have faced prosecution as a draft dodger. He had lived for a long time in Switzerland and might have applied for citizenship to the commune in Ticino where his dance school operated. In Switzerland, local communes confer citizenship and are inclined to be generous to distinguished foreigners who bring in money. Out of all these possibilities, he chose Germany, indeed Nazi Germany, to make his status regular.

Why? What was postwar Germany? With what did Laban identify? What did he see as "German" and why did it attract him? How did he turn himself into a "German," whatever that meant to him? Laban himself provides no direct answers to any of these questions, because he systematically conceals his own background and the real historical circumstances in which it could be raised. In his "autobiography" he describes a child genius who needed no external stimuli. He formed his own life; life did not form him. He says nothing about his native language. The well-to-do bourgeoisie of Pressburg spoke German as a matter of course, and German was the language of the Imperial bureaucracy. But the Labans belonged to a different social world, the military caste of the Royal Hungarian army. It was as a Hungarian officer that his father received a noble title in 1897. As such, the Laban family would have identified itself as "Hungarian" in citizenship and probably as "Magyar" in culture but not necessarily. They might have spoken German or possibly French at home, but we simply do not know. Laban says he went to the theater a great deal, but whether he went to the Pressburg German-language theater or the Hungarian touring companies, we do not know. The first twenty years may have been spent in Bratislava or Budapest or elsewhere. The fact that he graduated from a military academy in Vienna in 1899, where he got poor marks in German language, suggests that he would have been in a Cadet academy before that, not unlike the military schools in today's southern American states.

He or his father had intended that he become an officer. We do not know if he got a commission and then resigned or simply left before graduation. He tells us of his overwhelming artistic urges and dreams but not about how they collided with the boredom of drill and discipline in an Austro-Hungarian officers' training course. The determination to erase all traces of his origins makes it impossible for the historian to do more than guess about certain cultural influences.

It could be Laban's training as a soldier that drew him to movement in masses, as he choreographed huge choirs of dancers as if on parade. His emphasis on leadership and followers, his insistence on discipline and obedience, may also have arisen from his military experiences. They certainly attracted a certain type of follower and produced a certain type of atmosphere among the dancers. Laban regularly referred to "führende Tänzer," leading dancers. Military discipline mingled with Laban's fascination with the occult and with a particular kind of freemasonry to produce an amalgam, which combined military order, antirationality, and rejection of reason and rational enlightenment.

By the apparent clarity and transparency of the hierarchical, quasi-military structures, the reality of the surrender of individuality and rationality, and the delegation of individual responsibility and individual will to a higher authority, were concealed. Both the antirational and anti-enlightened elements in Laban's work led in time, both for him and for his student Mary Wigman, to a rejection of any kind of democratic decision-making within their communities and groups.

Unlike the story of the first thirty years of his life, this part of his life can be traced, indeed, all too well. When the Propaganda Ministry turned to Laban to provide the plans for a new Nazi dance, they chose the one dancer and dance theorist in Germany who could combine art, practice, theory, and mystification in the perfect doses required by the Nazi bosses. Laban's grandiose schemes for dance had already been enunciated in his experiments in the 1920s, among them in the "folkish" community of Glenschendorf* in the north of Germany. He had written at length about them, and had written a popular autobiography that had as its title a motto for his own life, Ein Leben für den Tanz (A Life for Dance) With its overtones of vocation and sacrifice, it created the atmosphere of cult leadership which Laban cultivated and which survives in Laban disciples still today.

Nazi megalomania had found the dance megalomaniac genius who could meet its insatiable need for show and spectacle, dressed up in the mystifying language of race, instinct, cult, bonding, hierarchy, subordination, and self-abnegation. The Ministry had found its man. Like Wigman, Laban belonged to a tendency in modern art history, which, in the words of the late Thomas Nipperdey, rested on "an anti-enlightenment, 'secular' religiosity". Dance was an art form through which the world could be made better and ultimately redeemed. This salvation occurred in a cosmic frame in which devotion and faith could effect the spiritual transformation. In this world so conceived, dance became the expression of a meaningful, directed, and redeeming kind of bodily movement. It was a kinetic and corporeal redemption. In hundreds of pages of writing, Laban preached this new doctrine. Fritz Böhme, whom we have already discussed, became a convert to the Laban cult and served the master as chief publicist, journalistic defender, and court theoretician. In Böhme’s private papers, there is a statement of the aims of Laban’s dance art, which catches the astonishing mix of religiosity, pseudo-science, and dance theory that intoxicated a generation of dancers and spectators. The article is entitled: “Geometry and Space Rhythm in dance formative principles”:

Today the issue is this, that the individual finds himself in a living relation of force to the center of the event in space and remains constantly in this rhythmic dynamic contact. To dance a circle is no longer simply to trace circular lines on the parquet but to feel oneself peripherally dependent on the streaming forces of an imaginary or really turning center of a circle... Anybody can walk the circumference of a circle or after a little practice be able to do it; one must have experienced the rhythmic circle as force in order to be able to translate it into reality. This experience can only be attained by an individual action in standing contact and communion with others.

Laban and Wigman lived their art. They turned their art into the ultimate measure of their lives. They had practiced this life-as-art for many years, especially in the commune on Monte Verita in Ascona, Switzerland. This fusion of life and art made their immersion in the Nazi ideology much easier. It was another identification of life and art, submission of art to a higher calling. Both had already turned the “German” in dance into the distinguishing mark of their artistic endeavor. Both were anti-Semitic and acted on their views. Both demanded total submission of their dancers and followers, so a society modeled on the Führerprinzip seemed entirely acceptable to them. Laban’s creative choreography centered on choral works, movement choirs, festivals of dedication, and festival choric events.

Wigman tended towards the Tragic and the Fateful in Nietzsche’s sense and danced those themes. Laban’s military background may have, as we suggested above, also contributed to the nationalistic, irrational, cultic elements and a certain authoritarian rigor that the Nazis found congenial. Long before 1933, he had been fascinated by drill, bodily training, and the submission of the individual to group and collective movements. Of course, these elements of training, discipline, and group movement could be found in ballet as well. Laban acknowledged that ballet rested on formal training and technique that could only be mastered through endless drilling. It too conveyed artistic meaning through rigorous training. Technique carried the articulation of a movement idea. The trouble was that ballet produced a functioning dancer not a mastered personality. Technique in ballet divested the way the art functioned and made the mechanical elements transparent and comprehensible. Ballet owed its representational ideology to the Cartesian certainties of the late seventeenth century. It could not be absorbed into an ideology like Nazism. Ballet could degenerate into pure decoration or turn into icing on the surface of art. It could be as empty, vain, frivolous, artificial, or superficial as an operetta. What it could not easily do was to dance a Weltanschauung or embody an ideology comparable to that of German dance. Ballet rested on its very formal properties and remained external, itself and distinct. Ausdruckstanz on the contrary not only apparently neglected technique but even veiled those indispensable technical aspects of any dance form. Technique must never distort the ideas and ideological content of a dance. Exercises had, of course, to be carried out, but they must never affect the substance, the essence, and the characteristic elements of expression. Dance rested on faith. Devotion and self-sacrifice characterized expressive dance, a way of life more than an art form. Ballet was abstract dance. Ausdruckstanz considered itself to be "absolute dance."

Here stood in opposition to each other two antithetical ideas of dance, art, and the world: the one in essence rationalist; the other primarily metaphysical. While the devotees of Ausdruckstanz hastened to enroll under the swastika and to serve the new regime, the ballet people seemed almost indifferent to the revolution going on around them. In the early years of the Third Reich, the ballet complained of money shortages but seemed to have no other problem with the system. The National Socialists were on the verge of declaring ballet to be "un-German" and the ballet world shrugged its collective shoulders. There were no protests, pleas, or Ministerial Dance Politicos 103 defenses.

One thing could not be expected of ballet: an unequivocal confession of loyalty to the values of National Socialism. That was reserved for Ausdruckstanz. Individual ballet dancers gave declarations of allegiance, but their art could not show that. Everything else remained outer show and window dressing, as the expressive dancers constantly asserted. The expressive dancers were almost certainly right in their criticisms. Identification with contemporary political goals and regimes is, in fact, much harder to achieve in ballet and not easily imagined. Libretti can be adjusted or written anew. But even then, ballet was regarded as only ostensible, expressing ideological values profoundly alien to itself.

Another circumstance contributed to the contrast. The Ausdruckstanz depended on directors and choreographers who belonged to the groups they led. Expelling Jews and adopting National-Socialist ideology had to be carried out by the great names themselves. Dance in its modern form became, to paraphrase Bohme's dictum, necessarily "a race question." Ballet operated within the traditional theatrical structures with intendants and theater managements who carried out the racial "cleansing" and other nazifying measures. The stars of the ballet had nothing to do but avert their gazes when their colleagues were victimized.

The organization of dance by the Nazis only took final form in late 1935 and early 1936, though its shape was clear to perceptive insiders as early as autumn 1934. Active and creative dance was formed into two Fachschaften, one for theater and one called dance. The final structure froze the division between theater dance and free dance, because the two genres now belonged to different professional groups. The following text is OCRed from a book.

As Laban gradually acquired his position of authority, he maintained a hold on both branches. That was not uncharacteristic for him. He had worked as choreographer at the State Opera in Berlin and had his own groups of free dancers. Yet his inclination towards, and origins in, free dance tilted the scales decisively against ballet. His influence institutionalized the prejudice against ballet, which gradually receded into the background and fell out of favor. Laban found himself in an astonishing position, unique, perhaps, in the entire modern history of artistic dance. At long last, after many setbacks and failures, he now had the resources and structures of an advanced modern state at his disposal with which to achieve his most grandiose visions of dance as a universal experience. With von Keudell, he planned not only specific practical measures but began to reorganize the entire German dance scene. In his first great project, he realized von Keudell's idea of some sort of display of Ausdruckstanz's potential by organizing the German Dance Festival of 1934. In addition, he turned his long-cherished idea of an institution of higher education in dance into the German Dance Theater and the German Master Workshops in Dance. Between 1934 and 1936, both institutions opened their doors, and Laban directed each. Next, he instituted a general schedule of proficiency examinations in dance for practitioners and for dance teachers. He directed the 104 Marion Kant dance festivals for the Olympic Games in 1936 and designed a grand stage dedication ceremony for the Dietrich Eckart-Theater.

Laban's fall was as rapid as his rise. From 1936 on, Laban's schemes began to flounder, and he himself grew uneasy about their future. Laban's life's work suddenly began to crumble, and subsequently, he fled Germany. The following sections and chapters trace the trajectory of the ascent and descent of the greatest of the dance visionaries of the twentieth century.

The Dance Festivals of 1934 and 1935
In the memorandum of July 1934, discussed above, von Keudell had suggested that there ought to be some way to show off the skills and achievements of German expressive dance. He suggested that performances and festivals be used to show the world just how good German dance actually was. Laban took up the challenge with his customary energy. Here was the chance to realize his projects. He had always had a staff around him to carry out his designs and plans. His pupils, his followers, his female admirers, and his true believers stood by him in this project. He placed some of his trusted assistants as directors of the German Dance Theater.

Next, he tied the work of the German Dance Theater to the planning for the German Dance Festivals. In this way, he ensured that both projects were safely in the hands of loyal and devoted, if uncritical, female collaborators. Laban received every organizational support of the Propaganda Ministry in the preparation and realization of the Dance Festivals. His suggestions on content were in any event not controlled or contested. Laban enjoyed the confidence of von Keudell and through him of the entire Ministry. Laban could act on his own authority. The German Dance Theater was too new to have its own theatrical infrastructure, so Laban simply made use of the structures of the Ministry for administrative support, in order to achieve his ambitious schemes. In addition to financial support, Laban needed the Propaganda Ministry for propaganda and advertisement. The Dance Festivals were supposed to be so widely publicized that they would be a huge success. These first German Dance Festivals carried Laban's hopes for the further development of modern dance in Germany. At the time that Laban was organizing the dance festivals, very different discussions were going on in other areas of the art world about the place and justification of the modern currents in the Nazi cultural universe. By engaging Laban and giving him such extensive powers, the Propaganda Ministry had opted for a variant of modern art which, through its acceptance, was protected from the label "degenerate," "un-German," or "racially alien" as some other versions of modernism appeared to be, such as cubism, expressionism in the fine arts or the twelve-tone scale.

During 1934, an "art opposition" formed, for the second time, in the graphic arts to combat Rosenberg's narrow views and attempt to rescue concepts of modernity for the Nazis. German dance remained unaffected by the attack on modernism. It was in some undefined way not "degenerate" precisely because the Nazis had incorporated it into their cultural policies. Direct attacks on the ruling form of modern dance hardly occurred within Germany, therefore it was not necessary to form an "opposition" of any kind.

Between Bode, Bohme, Laban, and Wigman, the question was how much and to which degree German dance represented the National-Socialist movement, but not whether it did. Of course, it was a perfect expression of Nazism, they all knew that. Nobody, neither the Nazis nor the dancers and dance theoreticians, had any doubts. Although modern German dance evolved in the same Weimar climate of cultural experiment that marked the other variants of modernism, the Nazis seemed unwilling to find fault with it as a whole or to condemn it for its origins.

Individual artists, who had uncomfortable associations in what was known as "the time of the system" [the Weimar system - JS] occasionally ran into trouble with authorities, and proximity to the old regime gave the authorities convenient leverage against certain individuals or works. But there was never any serious condemnation of modern dance for its modernity and certainly no hint of "degeneracy." German Ausdruckstanz had become part of a Nazi vanguard. Nor was this honorable position ever revised either by the regime or by the artists.

Where a writer like Gottfried Benn tried to rehabilitate avant-garde expressionism and formulated that he saw the artistic movement as the beginning of an antiliberal process of thought, and Max Sauerlandt did the same for his version of expressionism, emphasizing the "national spirit" as artistic origin, German modern dance required no apology for its roots in modernist expressionism.

Again, when in March 1934, Italian futurist painting caused a fuss in Berlin with its outspoken commitment to modern non-objective painting and thus raised the whole question of avant-garde art in a fascist state,—Rosenberg smelled "sabotage"—the dance community simply went on busily incorporating its activities in the Nazi cultural structures. It may be that dance was too marginal an art form to provoke debate, but with the organization of the dance festivals, Laban had staked a claim to artistic centrality. He could offer the regime his loyalty and support, but above all, an art form in which disagreeable discussions about the appropriateness or not of artistic expression in the new national community no longer had to be raised. He could offer the new rulers of the new Germany a consensus in an internationally recognized artistic activity. He was not the only protagonist either. The festivals featured all "the important representatives of German artistic dance," including Mary Wigman, Gret Palucca, Dorothee Giinther, Harald Kreutzberg, Yvonne Georgi, Jens Keith, Valeria Kratina, and of course Laban himself. All these famous dancers stayed in Germany. The émigrés like Kurt Jooss or Jean Weidt simply disappeared unlamented. Their places were soon filled by eager younger dancers and choreographers. One of them, Ilse Meudtner, said: "Wir waren dran" ("it is our turn now"). Laban could rely on his experiences with the dance congresses of the last years of Weimar. The dance festivals were in principle a continuation of those gatherings under a different flag. The basic idea was the same. The discussions that had accompanied the dance congresses during the Weimar Republic had not actually ceased, but the conditions under the new regime were so favorable that most of the outstanding issues could be settled. Laban described these earlier debates with contempt and, using the antidemocratic verbiage adopted by the Nazis, described the dance congresses as a portrait of the Republic's democratic parliaments. They were, wrote Laban, useless "talking shops," "endless chatter and strife," mere "dance parliaments."7° For Laban there was no longer a reason to argue. State support and ministerial encouragement for modern German dance had been achieved. Social security for dancers was now in view. Integration into so welcoming a political system must be no longer disputable. Artistic and political objectives matched each other perfectly, and in this area too there was no longer anything to discuss. The identification between dance and politics was now complete. In preparation for the dance festivals, Laban traveled through Germany and inspected groups and soloists in every city. In each case he wrote an assessment of the adequacy of the performers to be included in the festivals. Neither he nor his uncritical adoring helpers understood that in their temporary empire they were heading for disaster. Laban enjoyed his plenitude of power to the full. Never one to doubt his abilities, he never bothered to consider the limits of his competence nor to let anybody more expert on bureaucracy advise him. Unaccustomed to being contradicted, he assumed that what he said must necessarily happen. Neither reflection nor criticism applied to him or to the art that he felt he embodied. There was to be nothing less than affirmation and applause. The Wigman Dance Group enjoyed very similar patronage from von Keudell. In the Propaganda Ministry, the view was that Wigman and her troop should enjoy special treatment because they were an artistic ensemble of unique excellence. When Wigman spoke of her group as the "Central Institute of German Dance," von Keudell encouraged her. No group after hers ever received such enormous subventions nor such remarkable respect and attention, not even the Fischer-Klamt group after 1937. The Propaganda Ministry pulled out all the stops to attract attention to the Dance Festivals. There were articles in the press, two radio programs per week, a propaganda film and an exhibition "Dance as Art" in the State Museums. Domestic and foreign press reports pointed to the great significance of the festivals. When they took place in December, the preparation had been so intensive that a failure seemed simply inconceivable. In fact, the festivals were really very popular and got much applause. The individual dance performances and choreographies drew on the successful works of the most famous dance groups, dancers, and directors of the period. They played to tastes already well established and reflected the tastes of the period. In one of the publications that accompanied the festivals, Laban wrote that the time of “uncritical, randomly assembled offerings” was at last over, and the time of the celebration of dance in the festival had arrived. Festivals would be attractive to a large number of members of the people’s community. He put “our means of expression and the language of concentrated force in the service of the great task ..., which our Volk must fulfill and to which the Fiihrer shows the way with his inexorable clarity of vision.”78

Ministerial Dance Politicos 107

With his own “inexorable clarity,” Laban began to plan for an even grander festival in 1935. Von Keudell, the tireless senior civil servant in the Goebbels’s Ministry, had arranged, in agreement with Laban, that the dance works from the festival should be shown all over Germany. Von Keudell announced as his program that German dance, as bearer of German Kultur and as embodiment of the spirit of the new German experience, had to be shown everywhere. The organization of German cities received orders, together with the Reich Music Chamber and the Reich Theater Chamber, to set up lengthy tours to last for several weeks through all the Gaue (the Nazi Party’s districts) and to support the enterprise financially."

German dance as symbol of the new era must be taken to the remotest regions of the Reich and all German people should be able to experience it. Von Keudell dismissed any reservations expressed by the artists themselves. They were told to keep themselves ready and assured that it would not harm their careers.80

The tour never quite achieved the grandeur that von Keudell had hoped for. Some of the local communities showed little interest in hosting dance performances. On the other hand, ten of the biggest cities agreed to the proposal. The dance festivals did travel and dance was again made even more important than before. Trouble soon began to cloud this sunny perspective. Laban found that there was no unanimity in the dance community. The views of his opponents began to be heard. They rejected his claim to represent German dance and this opposition undermined his authority. Among the critics were people of standing: Rudolf Kélling, ballet master and choreographer at the City Opera/German Opera of Berlin; Aurel von Miloss, ballet master and choreographer at the Municipal Opera of Dresden; Jutta Klamt, directress of the Berlin Klamt school. These formidable critics made a strong case against Laban and his methods. Kolling complained that it was misleading to talk of a “German” dance festival when the participants were exclusively drawn from concert and podium dance and ballet was emitted. Groups from theaters or opera houses were only included if they were directed by representatives of Ausdruckstanz. Miloss supported this criticism and asked why ballet had simply been ignored. He described how Laban had treated him in a shabby and humiliating way. Complaints from such personalities in the ballet world had added force because they were articulated by the modern exponents of ballet who had frequently been Laban’s pupils. It was not a surprise that figures like Kélling and Milloss were complaining. The exclusion of ballet had been part of Laban's plan from the beginning. Von Keudell had approved the plan, and Laban saw no reason to modify it to silence the critics. He noted their complaints, but it was far too late to change course. Perhaps at future dance festivals, the complainants might be accommodated. This was a feeble consolation for the critics. Klamt's complaints were more serious because she came out of the German modern dance camp. She asserted that the women disciples of Laban had prevented her and her pupils from playing the role they felt was theirs. Klamt had also won the support of the Fighting League for German Culture, and her backers refused to compromise on matters of cultural principle. Both Klamts, Jutta and Gustav Joachim Fis- 108 Marion Kant cher-Klamt, had ambitions as grand as Laban's and could outflank him on the ideological front. They had begun to lay the basis for even more dangerous charges and later attacks that arose from them. In the short run, Laban parried their assault and managed to keep the Klamts in bounds.

The festivals of 1935 took place in November again under Laban's control. They followed the same principles as those of 1934. Once more von Keudell assured Laban the full support of the Ministry. Like the first festivals, they took place in the People's Theater on the Horst-Wessel-Platz (before 1933 the Biilow-Platz, after 1945 the Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz, and after 1989 the naming of which remains a subject of dispute which continues to this day). In the 1920s, the People's Theater had introduced the series of modern dance matinees, which made it a particularly appropriate venue. Most of the artists who had danced in 1934 appeared the following year. The program had more system and Laban had conceded more time to theater dancers, balancing the categories with more care. The second festival presented more first performances of new works.

"Special forms of dance creation" were solemnly announced, including the chorus works by Mary Wigman, and the dance songs by Lotte Wernicke Die Geburt der Arbeit (The Birth of Work) and Lola Rogge Die Amazonen (The Amazons). Whereas Wigman used the conventional term "a dance cycle" for her new work, Wernicke and Rogge called their new creations "choric dance pieces" or "movement choirs," which showed that they had accepted Laban's concept and his view that the "movement choir" should be considered a new genre for the new German Reich. In a memorandum for Goebbels and the other senior bureaucrats in the Ministry, von Keudell claimed that the Wernicke and Rogge pieces represented a moment of decisive importance.® Both works showed an excellent understanding of the movement of lay-people, the management of great masses of people. In both works, the choreographers used and displayed original artistic figures drawn from a variety of social classes. This came near to being the dance equivalent of the Volksgemeinschaft or People's Community, which National Socialism was beginning to create. The dance community welcomed the new forms with enthusiasm. Von Keudell could even point to improvements in the ballet. The ballet Barberina, choreographed by Lizzie Maudrick, ballet mistress at the State Opera Berlin, showed that even ballet had begun to adopt the program of the Propaganda Ministry. The Minister, von Keudell assured his chief, would be delighted when he saw the new work.

CHAPTER 10
The German Dance Theater and the German Master Workshops

In the preparation of the dance festivals, von Keudell had taken up the idea of founding a dance theater [“Tanzbiihne” literally means dance stage —JS]. Laban was to be the director of the new creation. The institution was intended to be permanent, not merely a framework for the annual festivals, although in the first instance the staging of the festivals took precedence. Laban insisted on the idea that a permanent theater for modern dance was an essential part of the scheme. “The ideal of a dance theater is indissolubly bound up with the creation of dance as an art that transcends the mere provision of entertainment ...,” which can “elevate its moral force and make the meaningful beauty of the world of appearances comprehensible in its rhythmic motionality.” “Germany is the land in which this ideal of our time can first and fully establish its roots.”°? Laban drew on his experiences in Hamburg and Munich to support the idea of a permanent dance theater. The dance theater had always meant “the community of artists who strive to live a true life of movement” and at the same time he envisaged the housing within which the new art form could have its “Schaustatte.”®4 In the meantime, he had broadened the idea, which in its original forms seemed vague and open to various interpretations, and now demanded that the new house be a place of gathering of all the forces as well as a home for German dance. Naturally, he placed the theater squarely in the path of the “national tasks.” He used the parallel of the warm relationship between the political leadership of the German Empire and Richard Wagner's opera house in Bayreuth to illustrate how his dance theater followed in the great tradition of German national art. The Master, Richard Wagner, provided the tested model for the future of German dance. As he put it, from the great fountain of German theatrical and artistic creation in Bayreuth, the inspiration for the new spirit and practice of the German Dance Theater was drawn. This patriotic rhetoric was not merely a verbal commitment: there lay in the parallel yet another rejection of the ballet tradition. In the nineteenth century, ballet had stuck to the gen. 110 Marion Kant res inherited from French theatrical practice and traditions, which had mocked the new Wagnerian conception of theater as total art. Laban's clever use of Wagner underlined the Germanic claims of modern dance by placing it in the most German of all traditions, the Wagnerian. Laban's affinity to the Wagnerian concept of musical theater had led him to choreograph the Tannhduser Bacchanale in Mannheim in 1921 for the first time. There, according to his autobiography, he retrieved Wagner's earlier sketches that were "Nordic fantasies, and had nothing to do with the classical Roman dance-poem that Wagner later created expressly for Paris."®> The 1861 Paris Tannhduser turned out to be a disaster, not least because Wagner refused to submit to the French custom of placing ballet scenes in the third act of operas and insisted on the Bacchanale breaking out in the first act. It was an immense honor for Laban when he was invited to produce the dance scenes of the opera in Bayreuth in 1930, with seventy dancers. There, he revealed, he was cured of his "excessive rejection of a representational scene theater by the magnificence"®® that the Wagnerian stage offered him. Only there did Laban find "the link with the stage-form of our day, by which I mean that I found a new way of using the traditional media."®" The experience in Bayreuth confirmed Laban's views of a dance theater, supplied him with a certain strength, and helped him survive the quarrels with "foolish little men"®® who did not appreciate his revolutionary concept. One might add that it finally prepared him to tackle the founding of a German Dance Theater in 1934. Laban's appointment as director of the German Dance Theater and simultaneously as administrator of the German Dance Festivals opened a period of unprecedented centralization of the dance world and an equally remarkable adaptation to the interests of the state. The price for these two achievements was, of course, obedience to and submission to the demands of the National-Socialist regime, which was apparently never reckoned too high by those involved. Laban and all the artists deemed it worthy to serve the new regime, and did so without a second thought and without any external constraint whatsoever.

The myth that figures like Laban, Wigman, and Palucca suffered terribly and hence had no choice to serve the new masters is simply a falsehood spread by them after the war and eagerly supported by their faithful acolytes, often as compromised as their great leaders. Let us be clear what that meant. The geniuses of German dance accepted the exclusion of all "non-Aryans" without demur. They agreed that certain artists and art forms were now officially "sick" or "degenerate" or "alien." They accepted, indeed welcomed, censorship and political supervision of their art. They welcomed the fact that it was being wielded by one of their own. They accepted the Nazi Weltanschauung in every particular way. They rejoiced in the grand German world mission and all its smaller consequences. As we have seen, they accepted Nazism before the Nazi authorities had decided what that meant. German dance chose the swastika before the state authorities had thought to raise it over their heads.

Laban took over direction of the German Dance Theater with the same certainty that he had assumed direction of the German dance festivals, the conviction that now at last German dance would flourish as never before. His early moves were made against the background of the worldwide depression and mass unemployment among dancers along with millions of their fellow citizens. Unemployment on a global scale encouraged governments in many countries to experiment with new schemes of state intervention. In the U.S.A. the Work Projects Administration established in 1935 by executive order of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt supported the Federal Art Project, the Federal Writers' Project, and the Federal Theater Project. Close to 10,000 drawings, paintings, and sculptured works were produced through the WPA, and many public buildings (especially post offices) were decorated with murals. The experiments in theatrical productions were highly praised and introduced many fresh ideas. Musical performances under the project averaged 4,000 per month.®? Laban's schemes, only partly designed as relief of unemployment, had the same effect. Unemployment fell particularly harshly upon modern dancers who lacked the professional infrastructures provided by theaters and theatrical institutions. The very short career of dancers in general made unemployment particularly desperate. Yet even if the dancers were employed in theaters or opera houses, they found themselves on the lowest steps of the hierarchical ladder. They received the meagerest wages of theater employees. In 1942, Hitler boasted that he had immediately raised the minimum monthly income for female dancers from 180 to 240 Marks. They could, he explained, now follow their artistic profession without having to prostitute themselves. "Thus, Laban operated on a level where approval from the highest rank was assured. When Laban used the Propaganda Ministry to relieve the misery of dancers, he could also be certain of the support and applause of the dance community. Future consequences played no part in the crisis. With the reduction of unemployment, the so-called “National-Socialist Rebuilding” began. “Class struggle” and “class conscious,” slogans of the old Marxist “system,” were no longer valid. Social responsibility, a category that dancers, normally on the margins of society, rarely felt called upon to exercise, lost all relevance.

From now on, only national criteria mattered. How German a dance or dance as such was remained the sole basis of judgment. The planned encouragement of dance and dance festivals was, as we have seen, Laban’s way of displaying the capacities and importance of the art form. The two institutions were to serve as display cases of artistic possibilities. The Dance Theater was both an employment agency and a dance school, which would set high standards and lead to career openings. The Dance Theater provided schooling, training facilities, and opportunities to go on tour.

In 1934, Laban gathered his personnel. Although he was fully stretched running the festivals, he found time to lay the foundation for further development both in theory and practice. He had his long-term goal in mind. The Dance Theater would be, in addition to a training establishment, the home of a permanent, first-rate dance company. By this time, Laban had reached a pinnacle of power in which decisions about every aspect of dance had to pass through his hands or at least land on his desk.

The other agencies that might have contested his supremacy had yet to get wholly organized. The Reich Theater Chamber was at the very beginning of its activity. It had scarcely begun to clarify categories to which various professional groups and individuals should belong. As a result, it took no part in the process of decision-making on fundamental goals and strategy.

In early 1935, nevertheless, a memorandum came through the proper channels in the Reich Theater Chamber that marked a change in Laban’s tactics. The memo, composed by the German League of Choir Singers and Association of Dancers, addressed the corporate structure of dance as a whole. It began by citing the great success of the 1934 festival and used it to suggest “further measures to ensure a unified structure and leadership for all free dancers.” Alongside the corporate structures that were suggested, the memo outlined certain provisions that would ensure a proper artistic and organizational orientation of German dance. The idea was that in addition to the German Dance Theater, there must now be a set of national examinations and tests to establish universal competence for teachers and pupils. These were Laban-style demands in von Keudell’s prose, but conveniently presented by the competent professional body. The charge that only elites were catered for in Laban’s scheme was thus neatly sidestepped.

Laban could now claim that he had the overwhelming majority of the professional dance community behind him. To mobilize the majority behind his plans made Laban’s project easier to realize. He needed a large number of enthusiastic coworkers to get his projects up and running. Hence the need for the memo. It was not a new idea, just differently packaged and labeled. The memo embodied the characteristic Goebbels view that the Propaganda Ministry gave the lead and the various chambers merely “administered” the practical results." The agreement of the Reich Theater Chamber removed an obstacle to the full realization of Laban's grand plan. The Ministry approved the lists of teachers and dancers for the new Master Workshops, the teaching and training section of the Dance Theater.1 Next, the provision of lists of engagements provided Laban with an overview of all the dancing in Germany.2 Now that he had a clear idea of who was going where and to what purpose, he could use that information to make sure that his pupils, selected with care and favored above others with financial support, would see themselves as advocates of his course. And his dancers carried the message into every dance troop.

In July 1935, Laban organized one of his traditional summer schools as a typical Nazi camp. In the camp, as in all the other organizations, unconditional obedience and discipline—two old preoccupations of Laban—were required. Exclusion and its consequences threatened anybody who broke the rules. The training plan stated explicitly that everything at camp was to ensure the great artistic objective of service to the cause of National Socialism.3 In August, the minister himself, Dr. Goebbels visited the camp and liked what he saw. In his diary, which he kept obsessively all of his life, he wrote: “Afternoon Rangsdorf dance school. Very entertaining. Laban does his thing well.”4 With the certainty that not only the Propaganda Ministry but the minister himself was behind his plan, Laban began to realize other aspects of the scheme. In Rangsdorf, where his summer camp took place, he founded and made himself head of The Reich League for Community Dance. By the beginning of the 1935 fiscal year, the budget for the German Dance Theater, including the festivals, had reached the impressive sum of 100,000 RM.

Now that Laban had satisfied the bureaucrats that he had the organizational skills to carry out large schemes and, even more significantly, had won them for the cause of German dance, he could turn to the much trickier project of centralizing and harmonizing artistic activity. The mechanism to do this was the Reich Theater Chamber. And it worked. The high esteem he had achieved led to the dispatch of a circular in April 1936.97 In it, the Propaganda Ministry instructed all of its local offices to establish in their districts institutes like the German Dance Theater, which had in the meantime expanded to include the new German Dance Master Workshops.5 In view of the sensitivities of the other ministries and agencies, and to avoid a repeat of the turf battles of 1933/1934, the Ministry called the new institutes practice studios rather than schools. That was of course, a feeble cover-up, for the studios were obviously intended to be schools, schools in the first instance for further training of experienced dancers and then in due course basic training for new recruits.6 Laban had always worked to achieve that goal, influence the development of dance by controlling the training of young dancers. He toyed with the idea of nationalizing all the private dance schools to ensure uniform teaching and to put an end to the tedious disputes about the right way to begin dance training. The effect of such ideas was to enrage all the proprietors and teachers in the private schools who insisted on their independence and their particular teaching styles and techniques. The logic of Laban's approach arose from his reflections on the history of ballet, which had an established and largely uniform set of introductory training techniques. He knew that German modern dance could only survive if all the various currents could be combined and brought into one systematic structure. This was the purpose of the Dance Theater and the Master Workshops. With that long-term goal in mind, he expanded the aim and aspirations of the Dance theater. He suggested that the construction of a uniform national system of examinations and qualifications be applied. The theater would not just be a place where experimental and interesting works were performed, but it could also be the home of a high-quality school of dance. He examined the descriptions set out in the national tests and worked out structures that might apply to all branches of dance—dancers, dance teachers, choreographers—in one professional structure.

The Master Workshops, or as they came to be known colloquially, “Master Places,” took over the tasks of a central institute of dance. Wigman lost the right to call her school the Central Institute of German Dance. She could be one of many, but her long battle with Laban ended badly for her with the demotion of the Wigman School to a humiliating equality with lesser institutions. The founding of the “Master Places” came close to realizing Laban’s dream of a higher institute or university of dance with archives, libraries, film archives, study places, etc. In May 1936, the German Dance Master Workshops were formally opened, and Laban received a contract to be their first director.

The Master Workshops had two sections, one for German dance and a larger one for ballet. Laban succeeded in winning Lizzie Maudrick, ballet mistress at the State Opera, to direct the ballet section. Other famous soloists got honorary appointments, such as Liselotte Koster, soloist at the German Opera (who was soon to become Adolf Hitler’s favorite ballerina), and Harald Kreutzberg, the darling of all dance fans. The direction of the German dance section was entrusted to Gret Palucca and her assistants, Charlotte Hélzner and Marianne Vogelsang. This was an obvious snub to Mary Wigman by Laban, her former teacher, with the help of her former pupil, Palucca. Wigman fumed but was helpless.

The executive ordinances for the Master Workshops were issued in Decree Number 47 of the Reich Theater Chamber. Among the provisions, one stated that the exercise of the profession of dancer would in the future depend on having attended a Master Workshop. That amounted in practice to attendance at one of the courses there or at an authorized private school, and to passing the test administered by the Master Workshops of the Reich Theater Chamber or its authorized instructional personnel—meaning that a dancer could only be a dancer if they had undergone a course in one of the national institutions supervised by Laban. The “Master Places” had thus become the central nodal point of all dance development in Germany. Laban had reached the apex of his truly astonishing career. But two more gigantic tasks awaited him in addition to the enormous burden of running his national dance empire: the installation of a national standard of dance in Germany and finally, the Olympic Games with the international dance competition planned to accompany them. The year 1936 was an absolutely ideal occasion to present to the world the full glory of German dance in its beauty, its unique technical brilliance, and in its testimony to the new German circumstances.

Regulations for the Conduct of the Dance Examinations
Soon after the start of the cooperation between Laban and von Keudell, the problem of national qualifying exams, a unified and unifying standard for measuring and evaluating dance, arose. Quite apart from any ideological or political goals, both men accepted that this was a problem that had long needed a solution. It was, after all, a German obsession to qualify every profession and trade by formal examination, and it was hardly surprising that Laban, a convert to things German, saw an examination system as the most important strand in the net of control he was weaving. The net should be so finely woven that no part of it could be untangled by carping critics or jealous rivals. Not only would this measure exercise control; the national examination system would raise the professional standing of dance and make it a respectable profession. The omissions over decades of the old “system” would be made good by the huge effort involved in erecting the national scheme of tests.

The tacit acceptance of the ad hoc and arbitrary assessment of dancers’ capabilities by various, idiosyncratic school directors and creative dance proponents would end and be replaced by a universally accepted, public, transparent schedule of examinations. The abilities of teachers would thus be tested in the performance of their pupils. At the end of the training, the pupil would appear before an examining board where firmly established criteria had to be met. German dance must at last submit to state control.

Regulations for the Conduct of the Dance Examinations would act as a disciplinary system. Dilettantism, the original sin of the modern dance movement, would be abolished within a short time. Examination as a state act of recognition of professional competence in dance was a new stage in dance history. In future, the state would confirm a dancer’s right to exercise her profession. Previously, any ambitious young woman or man could call herself or himself a dancer, and that was that. The unshakeable faith in an artistic calling had been qualification enough, but no longer. Anybody who failed the examination could not call herself a professional dancer, not join the Reich Theater Chamber, and, in effect, no longer be paid for public performance. Exercise of the profession rested on the satisfactory passage of the state examination.

In this turn of events, the Master Workshops, which supervised teaching and administered the examination, gained an absolute say on who was to be considered a dancer or a teacher. Through such surveillance, the Propaganda Ministry and the Reich Theater Chamber gained control of every aspect of dance. Regulations for the Conduct of the Dance Examinations were criticized at the time as coercion; although it is hardly surprising that a state dedicated to coercion in other spheres should wish to apply it in dance. The interesting question is: what advantage did the profession gain from the new system? Who coerced whom? The charge that an examination system would lead to the lowering of standards and the elimination of individual inspiration was not justified. The establishment of minimal standards of competence here hardly equaled a “lowering,” quite the reverse. Nothing like such a minimum competence had ever been required before. Yet the idea was not all that new. The dance congresses in the 1920s had frequently discussed the possibility of national standards in a “Tanzhochschule,” a college of dance. Practically all the significant dance schools demanded a significant level of artistic competence before graduating their students, though none had ever wished to be tested as institutions, an inescapable consequence of the new system. All schools and teachers were committed in principle to raising the levels of skill and performance. The new regulations followed quite simply from the needs of the art form in Germany and were a logical extension of Laban's well-known and widely accepted goals. Laban had reasonably good relations with several of the most important expressive dancers, on the one hand; on the other, his ideas and wealth of experience, which he had gathered over decades, made him unusually well qualified to be the architect of such a scheme. Mary Wigman, Lizzie Maudrick, and Dorothee Giinther worked on the regulations with Laban right from the start.'2 Together with Laban, they represented the dominant, at least the most powerful branches of modern dance and ballet training. The remaining dance schools, in particular the Klamt school, had been invited to make their own suggestions and contributions, which the commission took the liberty to include or reject. The consensus achieved between the various modernist groups was regarded as just as vital as that between the ballet and modern camp. It was a fragile arrangement, however. In the end, the regulations laid out the principles of a modern schooling system for dance. The standards for performers as well as pedagogues were set according to the necessities of the profession and the society for which the dancers worked and of which they were a part.

A remarkable feature of the new regulations was that classical ballet and modern/German dance were both integrated into the regulations. Whether Laban wanted to overcome the division within dance or simply tolerated the facts as they were cannot be answered. He must, however, have recognized that the system demanded moderation of the extreme claims of the modern school against ballet and accepted the need for compromise. That did not prevent him from refusing categorically to include classical pieces in the programs he designed for the dance festivals of that period. German Dance stood in the foreground of all concerns and was introduced as the first and most valuable field of study to project the National-Socialist ideology. All other branches, whether ballet, social or folk dance, seemed of lesser relevance. Though all parties had to make concessions, Laban managed to protect some of his specific interests. He secured an entire section, which enabled him to advance his dance theories. In the protocol of the final meeting, the section was innocuously called "Lehrkunde", which could be translated either as "Pedagogy" or as "Methodology".

The German term "Lehrkunde" is also slightly ambiguous. It is a word not often used in the German language; in fact, it is not recorded in any of the contemporary dictionaries. Today it sounds antiquated but in the mid-1930s, when Germans were 103 words, it might have encouraged to speak historic German and not use "foreign" language. "Lehre" and "Kunde" are both nouns; they mean teaching or also preaching and knowledge or knowing. "Lehre" is the handing down of a truth and the construction of a model by which one can measure and define a thing or a truth. "Kunde" (from "kennen") means the inherent conception of clear and precise ideas of something, in this case teaching. Hence "Lehrkunde" is the craft and knowledge of teaching. The six components in this subdivision outlined the fundamentals of the study of movement—static and dynamic behavior; theory of space, force (which in England became "effort") and time; analysis and notation of movement studies; fundamentals of the psychic and spiritual development of children and adolescents; fundamentals of the methods of practical work in pedagogy; effectiveness of exercises in their applications. The many issues and publications of the exam regulations show several alterations and adaptations over time. The term "Lehrkunde" was replaced by "Tanzkunde," the theory of dance, or the original contents of "Lehrkunde" were distributed more or less evenly between the two categories. Despite the change of name, the substance remained the same.

Compared to Laban's or Wigman's or Klamt's earlier sketches of dance instructions, the formulations in the exam regulations were more general and the subjects directed towards a more comprehensive study. The fundamentals of German Dance Theater and German Master Workshops movement theory and the theory of space, force, and time, stood in a prominent place; they contained the core of the theory of Laban's new dance.

The doctrine that linked human behavior to the laws of cosmological harmony and space, explored the relationship between the hidden links of space, time, and human movement, and connected the efforts of life to a communal identity, had made its way into Nazi dance ideology and was never removed. Ballet training and performance had been placed with historical dance forms. This can be considered a technical as much as a conceptual decision. Historic meant past, belonging to the past and not primarily a means to express the present, yet it also reminded of and could not help but value the historical aspect of the century-old tradition.

For both techniques, that of modern dance and that of ballet, all French terms, following the demands of the time, had been replaced with German translations. The pliés, tendus, attitudes, or arabesques were only included in brackets so as not to confuse the German dancer. She would in the future listen to her ballet master giving orders only in German.

The whole examination structure left room for maneuvers; as a model, it provided a useful guideline for a desirable education. Laban could modify the general course outline to suit his intentions and he could specify the exact content in practice either through the teaching personnel, which he chose (and that the Ministry appointed), or by correcting and inserting missing or underdeveloped ideas at a later stage. Not only Laban, though; anyone in charge of dance could contrive schemes and shift weight towards people or plots—and this is exactly what happened, but always within the given framework.

The exam regulations delineated a rough structure, built on the principles of several schools, and at the same time, they were the tool to exclude unwanted schools or teachers, which, of course, was open to interpretation. The interpreting would have been overseen by Laban. But even without Laban, the regulations proved viable for the daily Nazi dance instructions. The significance lay in the coexistence of the disciplines, seemingly peaceful and having overcome the quarrels of the past.

In October 1934, the decisive meeting to approve the draft of the regulations took place in the Reich Theater Chamber. The meeting concluded that it could now recommend that the regulations be issued as Decree No. 48. The Chamber complied, and on August 1935, the regulations for the Conduct of Examinations in Dance went into effect and were made public in all the relevant dance and stage periodicals.

By 1936, Laban had compiled an impressive list of accomplishments: the foundation of the German Dance Theater, the design and implementation of national standards for competence in dance, the Master Workshops as the central guiding agency in dance training and development, and two highly successful festivals of dance in 1934 and 1935. The crowning achievement was to be his direction of the dance contributions to the Berlin Olympics of 1936, the showcase of Hitler's new Reich. The task divided into the organization and design of the international dance competition intended to run parallel to the sporting competitions, and the choreography for the grand dedication ceremonies for the opening planned for the Dietrich Eckart-Theater.

The international competition followed the lines of the 1934 and 1935 festivals only on a grander scale. Now the greatest dancers and companies from the entire world were to perform. Each of the participating states would be invited to send its very best dancers. Invitations were issued by the Propaganda Minister personally. The guest artists were to perform in Germany and, though not explicitly stated, for the greater glory of the German State.

Martha Graham, the greatest American dancer and choreographer of her age, whose influence on style and technique in dance could only be compared to Laban's or Wigman's on German modern dance, refused the invitation in harsh words. She could neither travel to nor dance in Nazi Germany. She rejected a system that treated distinguished artists with the brutality and barbarity of the Third Reich.

Graham later danced instead for President Roosevelt. She had done what was necessary; she had expressed moral outrage, something her German colleagues had not even considered. In their rush to gain themselves place and favor—and this is the sharpest condemnation—they had made themselves literally blind and deaf to their moral responsibilities.

Among those who were not personally threatened either by the racial laws or by political discrimination, who also refused to enlist their talents in the Nazi new order, Kurt Jooss represents one of the very few cases I know to have left the country because he intuited where the persecution of his Jewish colleagues would lead. The Nazis were eager to get him back and would have welcomed him in 1936, but Jooss did something that Laban, Wigman, Palucca, Kreutzberg and the crowd of lesser luminaries simply never considered—he acted morally. He rejected a criminal system and refused to have anything to do with it. The rest did not. They enjoyed the favors of the Nazis until the regime crashed.

Graham's refusal robbed the Olympic dance festival of the presence of one of the world's most important modern dance companies. In fact, the foreign representatives were largely second-rate, so the big names remained familiar German ones: Laban, Wigman, Palucca, Kreutzberg, Ginther, Wernicke, and Maudrick. Folk dancing and gymnastics had to be pushed into the gaps in the original program. It was a cheerful but pedestrian occasion unworthy of Laban's reputation and his initial plan.

The opening dedication grew in importance. The festival dance Olympic Youth was designed to bind dance and athletic achievement into the new Nazi body culture. Carl Diem, the general secretary of the Olympic organizing committee, closely observed the sets and the conceptions for the dances. He had engaged the services of Carl Orff and Werner Egk, important and renowned German composers who had experience writing for and working with dancers and choreographers. Hanns Niedecken-Gebhardt, who had been attached to the Propaganda Ministry as consultant from the beginning of the Third Reich, took over the stage direction. There were performances by Mary Wigman and her company, as well as pieces by German Dance Theater and German Master Workshops. "Palucca danced a solo in the second scene called 'The Grace of the Maidens' to a waltz by Joseph Lanner. This was a variation on a dance performed in the Nazi leisure organization 'Kraft durch Freude' (Strength through Joy), which Palucca kept in her program until 1945. It was an always cheerful, uplifting bit of Nazi propaganda. Kreutzberg presented a 'Sword Dance' (or 'Weapon Dance'), which ended in the protagonist's heroic death by the sword. The loss of the hero was mourned in the fourth scene by Wigman and her group in 'Hero's Fight and Death's Lament,' which was a revision of her well-known 'Death's Lament.' Dorothee Giinther and Maja Lex choreographed the mass scenes with several thousand children and adolescents and supervised the rehearsal.

Laban's powers had reached such a point that in addition to responsibility for the organizational side of the Olympic dance program, he could indulge in his artistic ambitions as well. He reserved for himself the actual design and choreography of the opening ceremony itself of the Dietrich Eckart-Theater. He assembled various pieces for this ceremony, which he conceived of as a great 'dedicatory act' entitled 'Vom Tauwind und der neuen Freude' (Of the Warm Wind and the New Joy). The piece was to be the artistic and choreographic high point of the dance show at the Olympic games. A sketch of the piece, called at that time 'The German Destiny,' had been presented to the Propaganda Ministry through Herr von Keudell and had been approved in October 1935. Laban was encouraged to continue with the scheme, officially described as a strategic and logistical masterpiece because of the inclusion of 'German movement choirs and dance choruses from all the districts of the Reich.'

The rehearsals for the piece took place in June 1936 when the Reich League for Community Dance held its annual gathering, known as the 'community dance weeks.' Laban could now put the different bits of his 'dedicatory act' together. In all, some 1000 amateur dancers were to take part. They had received permits to stay off work; they were equipped with cheap train tickets and overnight stays; they had been provided with a daily food ration. Everything was set up, monitored, and paid for by the Propaganda Ministry. Even before the unofficial dress rehearsal took place, the Reich Dramaturge Schlosser from the Reich Theater Chamber and the RMPEP could congratulate Laban and assure him that the performance would be a masterpiece. Then disaster struck. Goebbels cancelled parts and then the whole piece. In his diary for 21 June 1936, he noted: '... Dietrich Eckart-Theater. Rehearsal of dance piece—free adaptation of Nietzsche, badly done and artificial work. I prevent a lot. That is all too intellectual. I don't like it. Goes around in our costume but is not really one of "11 our own. What had happened? Laban had acted in true devotion to the National-Socialist cause and had done his utmost to create a corresponding Nazi dance and movement piece. He had centralized the art and concentrated dance in a 'folkish' spirit. He had presented the idea of the 'Volksgemeinschaft' at every possible occasion. Why was the work so brusquely rejected? Had he simply fallen foul of the Minister or caught him in a bad 120 Marion Kant mood? Or was Goebbels suspicious that Laban was wearing the costume of National Socialism but did not really belong? The crushing remark entered in the diary has a history, which hints at possible explanations. Goebbels might have been afraid of repeating a terrible mistake." He had, for some time, tried to persuade Hitler to receive Gret Palucca and her pupil Mariane Vogelsang for a small recital. Hitler had finally accepted the idea in the autumn of 1935, and the dancers performed for him and a very small crowd of SS officers. On the evening of 7 November 1935, Goebbels entered the details of another encounter between dance and power in his diary: Hitler, Géring, Goebbels, and a large crowd of guests watched several new films, among others, a small documentary featuring Vogelsang and Palucca. Whereas the culturally confident and elitist SS officers were delighted with "13 the petit bourgeois Hitler was disappointed. He hated Palucca’s performance, “intellectual” expressions, whether in ballet or modern dance. Reminiscing years later, he complained about both Goring and Goebbels. When Goring had encouraged Hitler to invite Lizzi Maudrick, he found her “Ausdruckstanz” far too philosophical. Géring and Goebbels knew nothing about real dance, he declared, which had to be light, beautiful, and aesthetic. He had, by mistake, fallen for one of Goebbels’s enthusiasms. In a monologue in 1942, Hitler explained his views: They [Goring and Goebbels - MK] wanted to talk him [Hitler - MK] into thinking that Géring would be insulted if he only favored ballet master Kolling’s Municipal Opera, and only let his classically Greek-trained Charlottenburg Ballet Company appear and not the Berlin State Opera. Thank God he [Hitler - MK] had inspected the State Opera ballet beforehand — that was danced philosophy; the ballet mistress was a highly intellectual woman. Even more than her Ausdrucks (expressive) art, the stuff Palucca did offended him. That was truly awful hopping around with distorted jumps, no aesthetic dance at all. Goebbels had dumped it on him, he had insisted so energetically and eventually persuaded him with all sorts of lively hand-waving to see the performance.!!4 With this experience in mind, Goebbels would have been very careful about the choices he made for an official event. Whatever his own taste in dance and ballet, whether he preferred Palucca, Vogelsang, Laban, or ballet, he sacrificed all of them to avoid Hitler’s rebuke. Hitler was not merely an absolute dictator, his will had to be obeyed in artistic matters too.

I set out the chronology of events that led to the banning of Laban’s masterpiece: In August 1935, Goebbels visited the training camp Laban had set up in Rangsdorf and was pleasantly surprised and impressed with the results. In October 1935, Laban’s piece (at the time under the working title The German Destiny) for the opening of the Dietrich Eckhardt-Theater was approved by the RMPEP. In November 1935, in a private session especially arranged for him, Hitler dismissed Goebbels’s chosen dancers Palucca and Vogelsang as not beautiful enough and too philosophical. Meanwhile, Laban was working on The German Destiny and invited Reich Dramaturge Schlésser to one of the rehearsals in early June 1936. Schlésser was delighted and considered the choreography a masterpiece. The work now had the German Dance Theater and German Master Workshops 121 new and final title Of the Warm Wind and the New Joy. At the end of the month, Goebbels suddenly disapproved of the same piece and banned it from public performance. In August 1936, the SS journal Das Schwarze Korps celebrated Palucca, the same dancer Hitler considered intellectually intolerable, as the greatest German dancer ever and as personification of a true German identity and the new German values. As the elite corps, the SS was allowed much greater freedom, and they used it to promote elitism in dance as well. The article shows that, though Hitler's judgment was final, favored groups could sometimes develop their own artistic directions. The SS was a law unto itself. In June 1937, Goebbels entered another one of Hitler's dismissive remarks on modern dance in his diary. Palucca and Vogelsang, once favored by Goebbels, had again been condemned by the Führer. In 1942, Hitler recalled these events. His dislike of dance that was "too philosophical" had not changed the attitude of the SS but had profoundly shaken Goebbels. The Olympic Games were too important to include anything too "intellectual." Nothing could be allowed to go wrong. This was not the place nor the time for experiments. Rather than be scolded again by Hitler for not grasping what was essential in German dance, Goebbels dropped the whole undertaking.

As can be seen from the above chronology, the unfortunate Laban was not even the first to be reprimanded. Internalizing Hitler's comments, Goebbels realized that Vogelsang was "too intellectual," an insight he immediately noted down in his diary. By June 1937, Goebbels had altered his idea of what constituted good dance, given up on his erstwhile concept, and adjusted completely to Hitler's view: now not only Vogelsang, but also Palucca and Wigman were "too intellectual." He promised not to let the German film company UFA distribute another of those films with "philosophical" dancers. "Dance must be cheerful and show beautiful female bodies. It has nothing to do with philosophy." As always in the Third Reich, Goebbels had to anticipate the Führer's intentions and consequently had to eliminate what Hitler might dislike. He was guessing Hitler's will, and Laban was out.

The Temporary Finale
Just over two weeks later, on 9 July 1936, the Reich and Prussian Minister of Interior, in agreement with the Minister of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda, informed Ministerial Councilor Otto von Keudell that he had been transferred to other duties and had been assigned to Marienwerder (Administrative Presidency Kénigsberg) as acting District Presiding Officer. The transfer had a pre-history; in connection with the 1933 "Law for the Re-establishment of the Professional Civil Service," Goebbels had already asked for von Keudell to be assigned to the new Ministry. In the autumn of 1934, von Keudell had behaved very oddly at a press conference. Those present had reported that von Keudell must either have been dead drunk or quite mad. There was a huge fuss in the Propaganda Ministry. When von Keudell, a member of the SS, once again behaved very strangely, he was suspended temporarily and sent for medical examination. At the sanatorium to which he was assigned, the doctors confirmed the diagnosis that Keudell had suffered a serious nervous breakdown, aggravated by overwork and overdoses of bromine that had caused substance poisoning. In November and December 1934, there was an exchange of letters between the sanatorium and the Ministry, and eventually von Keudell was discharged and returned to duty as fully restored to health. There were no objections to his re-employment, and the psychic symptoms had been fully overcome. In January 1935, he returned to work in the Ministry. In March, he was removed from his post because the Office for Trashy and Offensive Literature was being abolished. A few days later, he was relieved of his posts in the presiding senate of the Reich Culture Chamber and his memberships to the supervising boards of the culture chambers to which he belonged. The personnel files do not give any reasons. Undoubtedly, suspicions about his sanity must have lingered, and in any case, Goebbels had decided that he was "too ready to compromise." In fact, there were grounds to believe he had never really recovered, and at forty-nine years old, he felt old and exhausted. Goebbels had chosen a series of fairly young civil servants, people in their late twenties or early to mid-thirties, whom he thought he could trust to carry out his orders with dispatch and brutality. They also seemed to bear the stream of ministerial complaints and insults with greater fortitude. He seems to have distrusted or despised all the principal officers of the Ministry and filled his diaries with contemptuous observations about their capabilities. Even his State Secretaries were too lax or "made deals" or "caused difficulties." Schlesser, a section chief and after all the Reich Dramaturge, wrote "dim-witted crap" etc. For the time being, until the authorities could get him out of the Propaganda Ministry, von Keudell was left in charge of dance, where it was felt that not much could go wrong and he could not do any harm. Von Keudell's decline and dismissal robbed Laban of his main support in the Ministry. He needed to have someone sympathetic to work with, but his luck now ran out. In place of the cultivated minor aristocrat who had a refined taste for high culture, the new desk officer responsible for dance was Rolf Cunz, a so-called "Old Fighter," that is, one of the Nazis from the heroic days of street fights and brawls in beer halls in the 1920s. Under the pseudonym of "Conrad Rieneck" and "Vilmut Orb" Cunz had written what passed for art criticism in Julius Streicher's anti-Semitic paper, the Völkischer Beobachter, and had in so doing made a name for himself. While von Keudell had behaved like so many career civil servants and scurried to join the National-Socialist Party only after they had taken power, Cunz had the prestige of a real Nazi from the great days of struggle. His record as an old Nazi showed him to be capable of physical and mental violence, heartless cruelty, and resoluteness in the cause. The peculiar fusion of brutality and artistic presumption made him a dangerous rival to von Keudell, and he arrived in office unwilling to tolerate any of his protégés and projects. Cunz belonged, like many leading Nazis, to the well-to-do bourgeoisie. The son of an industrialist, born in 1890, he had trained as a musicologist and journalist outside of the Reich and was a so-called Auslandsdeutscher (German abroad). In World War I, he had served from 1915 to spring 1917 as a soldier. He had then helped set up Nazi cells in Italian Switzerland in the years before 1933 and had carried out his duties "as a propaganda office holder." For several years, he edited the German Music Yearbook, published by Theodor Reisman-Grone's company. For the man himself and his right-wing dealings, Cunz had developed sympathies and was rewarded with his sponsorship. The story is that, like Gustav Joachim Fischer-Klamt, he had studied dance under Laban, but there is no firm evidence to support this link. As a member of the staff on Radio Stuttgart, he had become a member of the Fighting League. '24 CHAPTER 11 The Next Stage The Laban Case, the Wigman Case

Can took over the dance section of the Theater Department in June 1936, exactly at the time at which Goebbels had delivered his shattering criticism of Laban's "ded- icatory piece". Hence there was nobody to protect Laban and persuade Goebbels to give him another chance. There was nobody to explain that Laban's intentions were to be trusted and his ideas were really and truly National Socialist, that he was, in fact, one of them. Goebbels's crushing verdict cannot be entirely explained, because the pieces of evidence cited above are circumstantial, not definitive. It could be that he had merely changed his mind. In a system of arbitrary dictatorship, that was enough to ruin a career.

Justifications, clarifications or valid reasons were not necessary. Goebbels's change of mind was one thing. The other, more imperative question was whether his verdict represented a real danger or whether it was only empty rhetoric. Would it jeopardize Laban's present position or his future activities? Laban needed to be told where he stood and what his prospects were. He was alarmed about the allegations of homosexuality and Freemasonry—those were definitely not hollow threats. Yet the accusation of being "too intellectual" did not seem to bother him much.

Yet how would he know what strategy to take in his defense? This brings us back to the issue of lack of support for Laban in the Ministry itself. In the jungle of Nazi arbitrariness, people like Laban or Wigman were dependent on strong backing, favorable opinions, correct translation of their wishes and demands into Nazi language and thinking, on being in the right place at the right moment, on protection provided by high-ranking officials, on guidance on what to say and to whom, on interpretation skills to understand the speech patterns of the bureaucrats and party spokespersons.

The war of all against all did not spare artistic circles. The dancers and choreographers were engaged in their own quarrels, and many of them were not aware that they were nothing more than pawns for the politicians. Their own hostility to one another was only a shadowy reflection of the greater political and cultural conflicts. To survive this constant Darwinian selection of the socially fittest, one needed not only brutality but also a good instinct and a thick skin. Laban, Wigman, or Palucca may have been ruthless, but they were also naive in the assumption of their own importance and status within the system. If they had thought that their efforts to climb to the top would be rewarded by the certainty of staying there, they were wrong.

"Intellectual" was another of those undefined and shifting concepts in Nazi Germany that was used to denounce the enemy, any enemy, any rival, any undesirable person. Most of the powerful Nazis harbored a deep suspicion against the intellectual person or intellectualism as a theory. Hitler was extremely apprehensive about the sudden rush of artists and intellectuals to join the National-Socialist movement after January 1933. In September 1933, during the Party Congress, he warned of the con-jurers who tricked their way into revolutionary initiatives, who upheld the flag only in order to gain control again over the movement to which they did not belong. And Walter Frank!? dismissed intellectuals as unwanted and unprincipled guests who would do anything to keep close to the powerful.'24 For another group of Nazi officials "intelligentsia" stood for Bolsheviks and Jews, and Gestapo chief Mueller knew what to do with them: "herd them into a mine and then blow it sky-high. "As Hitler explained in Mein Kampf, life is struggle; struggle is a basic form of existence that consequently determines all human and hence all cultural expressions. The eternally warring factions, from the beginning of the Third Reich through to its end, proved Hitler’s theory right in an unexpected way. The rival groups engaged in ever more brutal policies to outdo the other, in whatever form. The 'clash of types,' here the Gestapo versus the SD or SS, had, in Michael Burleigh’s opinion, 'positive more than negative dynamics. Both groups competed in evincing hardness, implacability and ruthlessness.' Whether one follows current orthodoxy by dubbing this 'cumulative radicalisation' rather than creative tension, is a matter of taste rather than incontrovertible fact, a sociological versus a management theory."

"While Goebbels and Hinkel constantly complained about the questionable level of the art that labeled itself Nazist, they got rid of the few artists who were capable of producing indisputable art and not only poor 'Blood and Soil party propaganda posing exaggerated Nordic types.' As in the Laban case, they would detect the false pose and the pretence, and testify that those were not the real Nazis, not the really legitimate Nazi artists. They would throw people out of their positions—but they would also plunk them back in again if the situation was too desperate. They would even woo emigrants like the film director Fritz Lang or the actress Marlene Dietrich. Constant evaluation and constant humiliation were part of the game. Respect or tolerance were not. If Hitler could rebuke Rosenberg publicly in 1934, why should Goebbels not be able to do the same with the much less important Laban? At the time, Hitler announced that they (in this case Rosenberg et al) had never been genuine National Socialists, and Goebbels’s sudden realization at the Dietrich Eckhart-Theater that Laban was 'too intellectual' resonates with his master’s voice. That did not prevent Rosenberg from remaining where he was nor achieving high office later."

"Laban too despised anything 'intellectual.' Perhaps that was the reason that he was not worried initially about the charge 'intellectualism' and concentrated on refuting the other allegations. He confirmed in his letter to Frau Lieschke, that he was a faithful and reliable ally of the Nazis. As early as 1920 he wrote that thinking had to be gesture, united bodily tensions composed of agitations of the intellect and the mind. Space as key dimension, effort and duration would determine gesture, that is, rational activities. Otherwise, pure perceptions of the intellect, achieved by scientific research, would take over. The excesses of abstract philosophy or rationalistic epistemology, which always have their roots in petrified interpretations of concepts, bear within them the source of error. The result is skepticism, ossification, joylessness. The fate of reason, the fate of measuring and analyzing and comparing, as Laban saw it, freezes the inner spirit (Gemüt), the will dares not move. Feeling turns into fear and angst. Life becomes madness. 'The rational person and all who follow him end up ruined.' Thus, Willing—Feeling—Thinking had to be converted into the trinity of Willing—Feeling—Knowing." When Cunz declared that the “intellectual” was one of the destructive forces of German “folkish” identity (Volkstum) in dance, he was echoing Goebbels just as much as Laban. Once Laban had left the country, however, the machinery to justify his dismissal would be set in motion. Anything would then be dug up to attest to his incompetence, his ideological dubiousness, his criminal actions, etc.*4 The past, particularly the ‘Weimar past, would yield examples of untrustworthiness, no matter how much Laban protested his innocence. But a very different scenario should also be imagined: as success or failure of most artists rested on an extremely unpredictable change in mood, mind or opinion, close personal relationships and alliances, even temporary ones, were vital. It is conceivable that Laban, backed by a Goebbels who had had the guts to stand by his original decision to perform Tauwind, could have won Hitler’s praise. He then would have belonged to the group of artists—and intellectuals—who rose and moved upwards, to the status of a Strauss or Karajan or Schwarzkopf or Furtwangler. Cunz’s assumption of control over the dance section was an unhappy coincidence. Several factors combined to create the new situation, but his appearance in Section VI of the Propaganda Ministry had fateful consequences. It also has to be understood that Laban was not the only artist or academic falling out of favor at this particular time. In 1936/37 several of the cultural fellow travelers from the right-wing romantic tradition were put out to pasture—Martin Heidegger in philosophy, Carl Schmitt the conservative legal theorist, Hans-Severus Ziegler, the composer and musicologist who had so carefully planned the new musical Festkultur,° and, with them of course, Laban and Wigman, the geniuses of “reactionary” modern dance. These great figures, to which one could add people like the banker Hjalmar Schacht, thought they could use the Nazis to fulfill their agenda, a Jew-free renewal of the German conservative traditions. They were wrong; the Nazis were radicals—radical racists who were modern, scientific and ruthless in their determination to carry out their program and prepare Germany for the racial war. But for the truly great figures like Heidegger, Schmitt, Laban, and Wigman the sudden fall from grace and favor was an awful shock and disappointment. This particular change, a change towards an even more fanatically ideological and racist social order, marks a watershed in the conception of Nazism and has yet to be examined across all disciplines. Rk While Goebbels’s change of mind cannot be easily explained, the subsequent course of Laban’s career can be fairly well reconstructed. Cunz pursued a strategy that came close to the party line of the Fighting League. Artists were made through him or through policies he advocated. Keudell, who was hardly a liberal, worked with the great names and trusted their artistic judgment. Cunz, who fancied himself as an expert in all branches of the arts, believed he knew better than the great figures. Cunz began unpromisingly for Laban by reviewing the management of the German Dance Theater and the Master Workshops and objected to almost everything he found: the choice of personnel, which had, in fact, been chosen by Laban on criteria of absolute loyalty to him more than any other criterion. Cunz found irregularities in the finances and in the budget arrangements. While the finances were undergoing inspection, Laban went on with his preparations for the dedicatory ceremonies at the Olympics, rehearsed his grand contribution, and made the final preparation for the International Dance Festival. A new bureau chief had taken the dance portfolio and naturally wanted to familiarize himself with the details of expenditure in his area of competence. In August 1936, after the still mysterious and unexplained cancellation of his piece, Laban reported on the activities of the workshops in the short time they had been running and submitted his plans for the coming school year. He asked for a quick decision in order to be able to begin the preparations for the next stage. Laban suggested that the Dance Archive should be placed under the Master Workshops; Cunz wrote “no” in the margin. Laban made suggestions about personnel. Albrecht Knust should be head of the archive; Cunz wrote another “no” in the margin. Laban suggested that his two assistants, Ivers and Snell, should be continued as employees of the Master Workshops at the same generous salaries as hitherto; Cunz noted that annual contracts were quite unnecessary. Laban budgeted for a higher salary for the bookkeeper and cashier Ebrecht, who had taken over the main job of administering the Workshops; Cunz rejected that too.37 Laban was not informed of the refusals in detail but got a laconic note to the effect that the management of the institutions had not been carried out with the requisite economy. Shortly thereafter Cunz had terminal contracts prepared for Laban’s assistants. In the course of the reorganization of the German Dance Theater and the German Master Workshops their services would no longer be required and they were to be summarily dismissed and employed in other activities. Cunz asked the Ministry to examine the employment contract that had been offered to Laban.38 While his empire was being systematically audited and scrutinized, Laban was away from Berlin. From 21 August 1936 on he had gone to a sanatorium where he had begun treatment for severe intestinal ulcers from which he had suffered for some time. As a result, he could not answer Cunz at once nor arrange a defense of his enterprises. He found himself faced with decisions that he could no longer alter. Cunz’s new scheme validated the administrative competence and structures. The German Master Workshops would continue to be under the Reich Theater Chamber as before and operate “in closest touch with the Propaganda Ministry.”39 The expert desk officer of Section VI (dance) in the Propaganda Ministry was henceforth to be responsible for all and not purely administrative matters, that is “the artistic and pedagogic construction, the cultural policies and direction and the shaping of the instructional scheme” of the Master Workshops.40 Laban was not excluded but placed firmly under the control of the desk officer in the Ministry, not only formally but also substantively. At the end of August, in order to clarify the administrative issues, he sent Cunz a questionnaire that he had filled out and a cover letter in which he acknowledged that he was ill and could no longer direct the Master Workshops.41 In addition, he asked to be granted further leave to remain in the sanatorium to complete his cure. Cunz replied at once and extended Laban’s leave to the end of October. Laban sent Cunz a personal letter in which he thanked him for his energetic intervention on behalf of dance in general, and in particular on behalf of the work he had begun in the Master Workshops and dance training. He suggested to Cunz that he be relieved of management responsibility but be retained as consultant to the Ministry on matters to do with the “Master Places. "We must carry on and it must become a great exemplary affair," he wrote. Cunz received this letter with enormous satisfaction and expressed his delight in a memorandum. "In a lucky turn of events," all the problems could now be solved. Laban was really sick. His recent illness demonstrated that he could only be used sparingly and he saw that himself. Wonderful! The Ministry could avoid unnecessary harshness. Laban could be moved aside with a much-reduced salary and used merely as an occasional consultant. Now the real decision-making and artistic direction of the structures that Laban had built passed irrevocably into the more capable hands of Rolf Cunz.

How much Laban knew of what had happened in the Ministry is unclear. Nor is it clear if Laban realized that the concentration of power over dance that he had held was now at an end. What we do know is that he wrote another letter to Cunz at the end of October 1936, in which he reiterated the fact that for reasons of his health he could no longer carry out his contractual duties. He could no longer run the Master Workshops. For the near future he would have to limit himself to advising and consulting. Perhaps later he could be used to enlighten and spread the word by his writing and thus have a part in the further development of his beloved art. He asked for the preparation of a new contract in order "to place himself as always further in The Next Stage 129 the service of the great artistic rebuilding of our state." Cunz insisted on a further sign of submission. If he were willing to accept whatever terms were on offer, he might hope to be included in some way or other in the Ministry's plans. Laban accepted but it did him little good. Although he hastened to ingratiate himself with Schlésser, the president of the Reich Theater Chamber, and wrote servile letters to Cunz, his time was up. Cunz had set the machinery in motion to get rid of Laban as the leader of all dance in Germany.

The financial rearrangement was remarkably generous, possibly out of a certain grateful relief that the problem had been solved so smoothly. Cunz had already begun to impose his own ideas on the Master Workshops and a salary for Laban was a minor issue. Besides, the Workshops had already been properly nazified by Laban. Cunz went over the personnel. He decided to assume the presidency of the charitable foundation, which embodied the Workshops as legal entities. It was simpler to be both president and ministerial officer at the same time. As in all other branches of the Nazi State, matters had to be handled with immaculate bureaucratic and legal precision. The rules of the law governing associations were scrupulously observed. The testing of the teaching personnel meant examining the qualifications and commitment to the cause of some of the greatest names in Ausdruckstanze: Wigman, Palucca, and Giinther foremost among them. That Laban had chosen them made it all the more necessary to reconsider their positions. It would be wrong to speak of mistrust, and perhaps more accurate to call it a kind of game that every ruler plays, no matter how small the kingdom, to see if his followers are really his. Cunz found very quickly that all three ladies regularly used costumes that did not belong to them, a tiny and rather ridiculous irregularity. But as so often in life the great are brought low by tiny omissions in their tax forms, so in this case by an almost innocent appropriation of public property.

Reply ONLY with the corrected text:

Giinther declared at once that the whole business had been a misunderstanding, apologized profusely and begged official permission to continue to use the costume, which was graciously accorded to her. Palucca at first failed to grasp that she had stumbled into a matter of principle, since principle was never very high on her list of imperatives. When she finally saw what was at stake, she became very submissive and obedient, and with reason. Luckily for her, Cunz apparently did not know that Palucca could not comply with the "Aryan paragraph" because, according to Nazi racial law, she was half-Jewish. The Nuremberg Laws defined such people as "Mischlinge ersten Grades" (persons of mixed blood in the first category) to whom as a group many activities, professions, and officer rank in the armed forces were forbidden without explicit and formal dispensation. She had indeed applied to Hans Hinkel, the Reich Administrator for Culture Questions in the Propaganda Ministry, for such an exemption, which after many begging letters and interventions she was given. '46 Wigman behaved absolutely in character. Too grand to be bothered by the issue of a few pieces of cloth, she left the matter to her assistants to settle. Wigman showed by her haughty reaction that she, unlike the other dancers, had not yet grasped what it meant to live in a totalitarian state. But she would soon find out. Cunz embodied the bureaucratic side of Nazi brutality. And he knew how to be brutal. 130 Marion Kant He still had unfinished business with Laban as well. In December 1936, Laban received a consultant's contract from the Master Workshops for 500 RM per month as honorarium.'4" To an outsider, it looked as if Laban's suggestions had been followed. He himself seems to have had no idea that he avoided a worse fate by withdrawing voluntarily and at the right moment. In any case, at the beginning of 1937, Cunz himself was ill and changes were suspended. Detached retina had to be operated on at once, but the surgery was not completely successful. Cunz faced the prospect of permanent blindness and by the end of the war years had almost ceased to be able to work in the Propaganda Ministry. His absence led to a reprimand that the changes in dance were moving too slowly. Hardly back at the desk, Cunz had to deal with the criticism and replied with annoyance. He could not do wonders in the short time he had been in charge, especially when he had been ill, but he would soon get things moving.'48 Cunz now faced perpetual pressure from his superiors to show concrete results and was now, in addition, expected to justify all his decisions and dispositions to his section chief Schlésser and to Minister Goebbels himself. He had to provide plausible arguments for every step and a reasonable prospective that the step would lead somewhere. Immediately after his hospitalization, he returned to work determined to show his chiefs how competent he was and how right they had been to give him von Keudell's job. The pressure on Cunz may have accounted for the clumsy way in which he handled the cases of Laban and Wigman. What was to be done with Laban was for quite a while not very clear. Cunz had not been appointed to get rid of Laban. That it came to that within a month could not have been obvious at the start. It is a matter of dispute and not entirely clear from the sources whether the change from Keudell to Cunz marked a change in Nazi dance policy or just a change in personnel.'4? The curious contrast remains that the treatment of Laban and Wigman suggests that a radicalization had been carried out, but in the politics of dance, nothing really changed. Laban had already thoroughly radicalized dance and fitted it into the Nazi new order, leaving little room for further improvement. Cunz merely directed dance into the bureaucratic channels of normality. Neither Cunz nor any of his successors revoked any of the conceptual achievements that Laban had introduced to dance in Nazi Germany. This cannot be stressed enough, as Laban's departure from Germany has often been associated with opposition to Nazi ideology. Both Laban and Wigman had to show their loyalty, yet they were misunderstood. They assumed that their total claims to artistic leadership were compatible with the new leadership's claims to absolute leadership.

One of the earliest and shrewdest treatments of this issue comes from Herman Rauschning, whose "The Revolution of Nihilism" appeared in 1938. Rauschning, an early Nazi and like Cunz an "Old Fighter," took office with the new regime and rose to be Nazi president of the Danzig senate. Rauschning became disillusioned with the Nazis, resigned in 1934, and fled to Switzerland in 1936. In his discussion of the new elites, he wrote:

The Next Stage 131 In some of these circles [the old elite - MK] the expectation existed that they would belong to the New elites of the National-Socialist mass movement, assumptions that led in large part to the “combination” [of conservative forces — MK] who connived in 1933 [to put the Nazis into power —JS]. National Socialism shoved all these claims to one side with its sharp elbows. It needed neither a cultural nor social elite. It was the elite.'*° This was the painful lesson that Laban and Wigman had to learn. The old conservatives were no longer needed, however noisy their conversion to Nazism. The readiness of these cultural giants to serve Nazism and to adjust their ideas and practices to the new framework must be judged severely in spite of their later dismissal from their positions of authority, “dismissal,” it must be stressed, and not persecution.

Until the Nazis got bored with or irritated by them, the great figures submitted themselves with total dedication to the Nazi cause. In the case of the philosophers, historians, jurists, and other prominent early supporters of Nazism,'>! the story has been widely known and furiously debated. The story of Modern German dance, unique in this respect, has been covered up by what I have called elsewhere “a conspiracy of silence” and a “denial of the past.” OR Wigman was put in her place in June and July 1937.'* Laban was truly dismissed in October 1937, although the process to limit and ultimately eliminate his influence had, as we have seen, begun earlier. While Wigman and Laban struggled to assert their primacy over dance developments, both forgot that power lay with the bureaucrats in the Propaganda Ministry. Both tried to use the Ministry against the other and they ended up by destroying each other's standing because of their uncontrolled ambitions. Wigman tried to gain control by getting ministerial support for the plan to move her school from Dresden to Berlin and set it up as the leading dance school in Germany. Dresden was a “dying” city; Berlin was where things really happened. This was her reaction to being kicked out by Laban from the management of the Master Workshops. The campaign ended as a bureaucratic procedure on the desks of the civil servants in the Propaganda Ministry. Wigman had tried to leverage a favorable decision by appealing through the Reich Chancellery, which could testify to the purity of her convictions as a nationally minded German. She failed to impress Goebbels and his staff. Schlésser and Cunz did not want her in Berlin. In Dresden, she was far away and could not meddle. At the beginning of July, she was told that she could continue to offer courses in the Master Workshops, not, it must be clear, as director but simply as an instructor among others. If Wigman complained that the instruction rested on a confusion, she should be patient until the Ministry had settled the new curriculum. One would call her when the time was ripe. In addition, Schlésser pointedly advised her of her duty to help build National Socialism in the provinces. That was certainly unmistakable. Wigman was to know her place, but the official rebuff was, contrary to the legends about her "anti-Nazi" activities, absolutely not a condemnation. She could go on working as before. She had simply failed yet once more to be declared the uniquely German dancer and choreographer that her limitless egotism required. The National Socialists were happy with Mary Wigman as one of several. Wigman could not bear it. Right to the end of the Third Reich, she could not understand how the regime could have refused to make her the supreme figure in German dance when it was so obvious to her. She had certainly not failed to achieve that status for want of trying. She had done everything in her power to ingratiate herself with the Nazi satraps, but they paid little attention.

They were not interested in her demands to be the high priestess of some new Germanic dance religion. Nazism would never tolerate ideological competitors. In the meantime, Laban was supposed to assume his place as consultant to the Ministry for which he was getting 500 RM a month, but in February 1937, Cunz apparently sharpened his aversion to Laban. It is possible that Cunz felt no more distaste for Laban than he felt in 1936, but under pressure from Schlésser and Goebbels, he needed to show results. Laban was simply a handy victim. He could be easily demonized and blamed for everything that had gone wrong. With the crazy Keudell, the not crazy Laban could be sacrificed as well. Now that Laban had voluntarily surrendered control of the German Master Workshops, there remained other bits of his empire to dismantle, in particular the directing board of the Reich League for Community Dance, the leading source of Laban's lay dance choirs. As the initiator and founding member of the organization, Laban still had a seat on the board, and most of the other directors were Labanites. Here once again, an accidental change helped the Ministry. Marie-Luise Lieschke, the business administrator of the Reich League, was the first to feel the harshness of the new Cunz era. She informed the Ministry that she could no longer serve as administrator of the Reich League because she needed to spend more time with her husband, whose medical practice was in Plauen. She hoped the Ministry would find some further way for her to serve in the Reich League. Instead, Cunz's office simply thanked her for her previous services and gave no indication that she might be wanted in the future. Cunz replied that he was prepared to allow her the title of honorary chair of the board but under no circumstances to have any say in the budget process. Frau Lieschke accepted this solution with deep gratitude and assured the two civil servants that she would take on the intellectual direction of the Reich League according to the directives and desires of the Herr Reich Minister to cultivate and further true German popular dance. Schlésser welcomed her enthusiasm but reminded her that the full responsibility for the cultivation and development of folk dancing lay not with her but with the new administrator whom the Ministry would soon appoint. In May 1937, Cunz addressed a conference of the Reich League for Community Dance, where he suggested the need to reorganize the League. In a speech, which Schlésser had already seen and approved with the words “no objections” on the text, Cunz laid out the preconditions for the future of community dance. All things considered, he did not contradict Laban’s conception of the role of community dance. Cunz argued that the art form represented “the living expression” of a racially directed society. The racial direction that he had in mind was not new; it was a question of continuing along the already established course. On the other hand, Cunz pointed out that there would be no one method, no one specific system, but only folk dancing, elevated above all methodology and school theory. This kind of folk dancing would depend on anyone recognizing it with instinctive certainty. Laban, as the inventor of this theory and system, was not mentioned, neither positively nor negatively, mainly because his system would not be rejected but silently integrated into Cunz’s plans. In fact, Cunz took up Laban’s notion of social dance and community dance forming the basis for a new folk or “folkish” dance. Cunz, in effect, plagiarized Laban and appropriated his ideas.

This comparatively mild setback for Laban was soon replaced by more serious action as he reacted openly and in public in a manner that went against the wishes of the Propaganda Ministry. Cunz forced a crisis, which ended with Laban’s complete dismissal. Laban remained throughout absolutely certain that his system of bodily movement was properly “folkish” and expressed the spirit of the community dance movement. He also believed that it was universally applicable and, as a result, arranged a weeklong school in Bad Homburg. He did it without specific approval of the Ministry. Worse, he designed it without even communicating his intentions through the proper channels of the Propaganda Ministry. That was too much for Messers Schlésser and Cunz. They had to face the problem—how to deal with Laban and his methods. The League for Community Dance was given a choice: either the members attended Laban’s training course and thus showed that they had failed to grasp the significance of the Cunz program or they had understood Cunz’s message, would boycott the Laban course, and make a formal protest about it. A formal protest was duly drafted. Marie-Luise Lieschke complained in Laban’s name to the Reich Theater Chamber. Her request was turned down. Moreover, the Ministry raised the question whether the League really needed to exist. The moment that question was raised, the answer “no” became possible. Thus, Laban and Marie-Luise Lieschke, who was after all only Laban’s secretary, became superfluous. Her position as honorary chair of the board had only been a token, a recognition of Laban’s continuing influence. She herself was of no importance to the Ministry. Once the decision to get rid of Laban had been conceived, other objections to him began to loom large. After all, Laban was not popular with certain influential groups like the Fighting League for German Culture, the Hitler Youth or the German Workers Front. The great engine of bureaucracy, which had ground out decisions for Laban and against rival organizations, now went into reverse. Earlier the Ministry had defended him to increase its own outreach; now Laban could be served up to his foes. Old, tired methods of diminishing somebody's status were trundled out. Laban and his team were accused of bad financial management and wasteful expenditure, not without some justification.'®2 Laban was charged with having relations with Josef Lewitan, publisher of Der Tanz, the leading dance magazine of the Weimar Republic, and thus to an "international Jewish clique." The accusation appeared several times but since Lewitan had been removed from the magazine in 1933 and had meanwhile been forced to emigrate, not even Cunz could summon much enthusiasm for the rumors. In the lists of charges against Laban, one never even got a mention. Another charge was that Marie-Luise Lieschke's husband was a member of the Nazi Party, but also of the Rotary Club. That was impermissible because the Rotary was a concealed arm of American influence, had nothing to do with National Socialism, and had refused to disavow Jewry. But it showed yet again how Laban and his closest coworker held doubtful views on matters of importance.!© Cunz turned now to fulfillment of his plans. He suggested that the Reich League for Community Dance should become the German Dance Community. In practice, it would be under his control to ensure that no friction emerged between it and the German Master Workshops or other dance bodies. The Führerprinzip would be the means to arrive at a harmonious cooperation. Unsurprisingly his proposal was accepted.'© That in turn meant that Laban's membership of the Reich Theater Chamber was put into question and finally cancelled. He was no longer needed as artist, pedagogue, choreographer, and certainly not as consultant. He was advised to return to his original profession as a graphic artist.'©> It would not have been Nazi Germany if Cunz had not himself run into bureaucratic obstacles. Ludwig Kérner,'®° deputy managing director of the Reich Theater Chamber, protested Laban's exclusion from the Reich Theater Chamber, not on substantive but formal grounds. He and he alone had the right to determine membership in the Reich Theater Chamber. He saw no pretext in the grounds presented by the Ministry to disallow membership for Laban and Lieschke, neither of whom had been placed under special provisions. The Ministry must be good enough to withdraw its decree. In the case of Laban, the person concerned was an artist of outstanding reputation in the dance field. The public would never understand why the authorities had suddenly turned against him.'®” The affair remained, as is often the case in bureaucratic disputes, unresolved. Laban kept his membership.! Two final and serious charges, more accurately denunciations, were raised against him, which obstructed Laban's attempt to defend himself against his former employer, the Propaganda Ministry. The first accused him of homosexuality. The second he had provoked himself by confessing in the questionnaire that he had been a member of a Masonic Lodge. '® Laban denied the first charge furiously. That he had been a member of a Free Masons’ Lodge he confessed without commentary, presumably on the grounds that he would be excused if he confessed right away. His position had now been seriously undermined but he still seemed not to realize it. He kept spinning schemes to get back into favor with Goebbels; he only contemplated grandiose plans to gain the attention of the highest authorities as befitted somebody who regarded himself as the apex of the artistic world. In the autumn he traveled to Paris and returned perfectly freely to Germany. What might have happened if Laban had thrown himself at the feet of Schlésser and Cunz to beg for rein135 statement we can only imagine. Laban never made such a gesture to them, at least as far as we know. He apparently seemed to believe that von Keudell still had the power to make fundamental artistic decisions, but of course could not have known that Hitler’s prejudices had put an end to his usefulness to the regime. In that sense he was simply “unlucky.”17° Laban in the end could no longer escape the lengthening tangle of accusations against him and found himself in a sort of net. Neither Laban nor Wigman ever understood that the issue was not defense against denunciations, but acceptance by the bureaucrats, which made defense unnecessary.

The real problem was the nature of the hostility to them, which was diffuse and rested on the unsubstantial but not entirely false perception that they did not belong to the new order of the Third Reich quite in the way they presumed. They were ultimately German nationalists, reactionaries, and not really representatives of the “national revolution.” They were fellow travelers or, perhaps, fellow dancers, but not true Nazis. Or perhaps they belonged to one particular strand of cultural Nazism, but one that did not emerge victoriously. The original feelings had ended in the opposite assessment. The years 1933 to 1937 found them both to be vaguely acceptable, and so they remained in charge of the creation of a National-Socialist dance.

This process by which exponents of the first stages of the Nazi seizure of cultural power were put out to pasture has yet to be properly studied, but there is an important issue that arises from this changing of the guard in the field of culture after 1936. Is the fellow traveler who is left behind and limps after the marching column crying “wait for me!” more pathetic than the agile time-serving opportunist who never falls behind in the first place? Dr. Johnson’s dictum that there is no disputing the 171 springs to mind; both are odious. Equally questionable is whether artistic fellow traveling is less contemptible than political “precedency between a louse and a flea because art is somehow above politics.

In the end Laban left Germany. He had neither succeeded in regaining his standing with Goebbels and the Propaganda Ministry, nor in recovering even a portion of his former power and decision-making competences. He may well have been unwilling to settle for less than he had enjoyed and preferred to leave than pass from the front to the back seat of the dance world.'"2 He went first to Paris and then, in 1938, joined Kurt Jooss at Dartington Hall. In England he spent the rest of his days, gathered a new devoted following, and created a suitable myth to cleanse his past association with the Nazis.

CHAPTER 12

After Laban’s Fall

Nothing changed in Nazi dance policy when Laban was deposed. Although he had become unwelcome in his former haunts, his policies and institutions went on running in exactly the way he had hoped that they would. His person had been rejected; his policies for the further development of dance in Germany had not been. A new verbage was circulated; there was to be “a new order,” “expulsion of incompetent leadership elements,” “economic clean up,” “healthy recognition of achievement” instead of “the exploitative old system,” etc. Cunz dubbed himself the “Reich Stage Organizer of Dance.” The great work of reconstruction, which he proclaimed, and his new orders were nothing more than empty prattle. They lacked every sign of novelty. The Master Workshops operated exactly as before, when Laban and Keudell ran them. It was only in the employment of expert staff for the Dance Fachschaft that Cunz made cosmetic changes. With the pretext of cleansing the professional group of Laban disciples, he began to review all the personnel. He ran into the furious opposition of the managing director and senior civil servants at the Reich Theater Chamber who were not about to let some ambitious desk officer in the Propaganda Ministry meddle in their personnel decisions. In the end Cunz had to retreat and withdraw the charge that they had been part of a Laban clique. There was another retreat with respect to the title “master dancer.” The ballet soloists had repeatedly complained about it to Goebbels and had attacked Laban’s right to bestow it. Now the Master Workshops were forbidden to use it, only Goebbels had power over such awards. That was a second order setback, which had nothing significant to do with the actual training of dancers. Much more important was the end of the dance festivals, which Laban and Keudell had successfully run. If Keudell had run into obstacles in the financing of them, Cunz simply never bothered to try. Festivals, he argued, are competitions and do not serve the artistic development of dance. (That was merely an excuse; Cunz lacked the charisma and the artistic vision to run a festival.) And the ministry began to carefully revise spending in cultural matters. For the time-being Schlosser and Cunz did not use the opportunity of Laban’s dismissal for any fundamental revision of dance policy and set up no alternative conception to the one they claimed to despise. Certainly the chance had been offered to them with the opening of the Degenerate Art exhibition in Munich in July 1937 to clean up the whole dance scene, but at least as far as Ausdruckstanz was concerned, nothing of the sort occurred. The Propaganda Ministry had not used the term “degenerate” in relation to either Laban or Wigman. There was apparently no relation between German dance and the phenomena called “degenerate.” Still it ought to be noted that Cunz had once played with the possibility. In a memorandum of to the Reich Theater Chamber on 21 February 1937, he had written contemptuously, The doctrine of movement and the choreographic life-work of Laban culminate so completely in the no longer viable, liberal-Marxist, cosmopolitan art forms of the epoch of decadence which we have rejected without concessions and in a decadent aesthetic point of view of the pre- and postwar years, that with same justification we might have to recall the expressionist thought-dramas and constructive form theories, not least the mental acrobatics of musical impotence. This was not entirely wrong and would have corresponded to the lines of Nazi culture policies in 1937 and 1938. The following text is OCRed from a book.

Oddly, neither Goebbels nor Schlösser thought to use these arguments so common in the condemnation of the modern aspects of other arts. In this particular case, Cunz was reminded by the Reich Theater Chamber that only a few weeks before he had asserted in a public press conference with the international press that the healthy German character of the work of Laban and the new German dance was evident to all. In fact, German dance continued to serve the regime and serve it well. In 1937, the Propaganda Ministry sent representative artists to the Paris World’s Fair, notably the dance company of the German Opera under ballet master Rudolf Kolling, but also the Ausdruckstanz stars Harald Kreutzberg and Dorothee Giinther, whose programs demonstrated the extent to which they had adhered to the values of the new regime. Laban received a visa to allow him to attend. Cunz gathered in the fruits of Laban’s work, but distributed them to new favorites. Depending on their artistic position, Cunz doled out small or medium-sized slices of patronage. Cunz favored Jutta Klamt and her very Germanic dance; she was invited to give dance lessons to Goebbels’s daughters. Thus, the Fighting-League interests got back into the Propaganda Ministry literally by the minister’s private, back door. The bureaucratic daily round continued to grind out its schemes and pedantic ordinances and decrees. Cunz gradually sank into the morass of routine, day-to-day work. The school day, which he had taken over, had to be laid out each semester, and the development of truly outstanding artists could not be forced. The number of really important artists stayed more or less constant. The generation that began to dance, filled the places that “aryanization” had freed in theaters and dance groups; stepping into the shoes of its persecuted colleagues in a matter of fact way. Nobody thought to say anything about it, let alone to protest. 138 Marion Kant From German Dance to German Ballet For Cunz, the nasty quarrels never stopped. He was always capable of generating whole new sets of enemies. The character of the system and the personality of the individual reinforced each other mutually. Above all, dance in these years continued to operate on the principles of preference and patronage; only the patrons were no longer Laban and Keudell, but Schlosser and Cunz. When the Klamt Family also failed to bring about the great renewal of dance under the Nazis, the bureaucrats in the Propaganda Ministry turned their eyes towards ballet. Goebbels’s taste for dance in any case, rested on the the art of the pretty female body. And pretty, as discussed above, was certainly not philosophical. He really liked the Hépfner sisters, a pair of classically trained dancers who choreographed their own performances and fancied the waltzes of Johann Strauss as their accompaniment. They became immensely popular and appeared in reviews and films. Goebbels was also keen on La Jana (in reality Margarete H. Hiebel), an ersatz German Josephine Baker, who was always trying to get help from Goebbels. With these tastes, he naturally turned to ballet where nice bodies and gracious gestures were more evident than in the serious angu- larities of Ausdruckstanz. Goebbels observed Cunz’s new direction with deep mistrust and skepticism. In November 1937, he ordered Ewald von Demandowsky, the Reich Film Dramaturge, and Rainer Schlosser, the Reich Dramaturge, to inspect Cunz’s dance academy. The result was positive, but Cunz was put under pressure to show clearer successes. The following text is OCRed from a book.

During the late 1930s, the Nazi government took a keen interest in the world of ballet, seeking to bring order and control to the art form. Rudolf Cunz, a high-ranking official, had two primary reasons for intervening: one was the Nazi leadership's appreciation for ballet, and the other was the desire to teach the indifferent and uncooperative ballet personnel to obey the state.

Cunz's focus was on eliminating the "foreign" influence of ballet, which he believed to be of "Slavic and Romance" origin. He aimed to replace it with a "German ballet" that was "arteigen" (intrinsically true to the race). This idea was not new, as Cunz embraced the line taken by many Ausdrucks-tanz exponents.

In 1936, Goebbels himself shared his views on dance, lecturing Rudolf Kélling on its nature. He believed that dance should show grace, harmony, buoyancy, and color, rejecting intellectual games. Cunz intended to carry out a change of course with ballet, although it remained to be seen how good it would be.

However, Cunz's efforts were complicated by personal factors. He began to be pushed off the stage, with his name becoming less frequent in important communication. His successor was constantly ill and considered untrustworthy by superiors. He had a disagreeable tendency to accuse everyone he dealt with of incorrect behavior or untruthfulness, which annoyed or infuriated those subject to such bullying. Dr. Joseph Goebbels took control of the "Master Places" without admittedly changing much at the beginning. They continued to function according to Laban's precepts. Nor were the regulations for examinations or the structure of the profession altered. In December 1939, just after war broke out, Goebbels appointed Hanns Niedecken-Gebhardt, who, it will be recalled, was a friend and admirer of Mary Wigman, to direct the master classes. He was supposed to take up the post beginning April 1940. His status was to be that of a theater intendant and directly subordinate to the Propaganda Ministry.

Goebbels was certain that Niedecken-Gebhardt was "the right man" because he danced according to no Weltanschauung. Niedecken-Gebhardt certainly built up or rebuilt or simply carried on the Master Workshop. Above all, he tried hard to have them declared "Important for the war effort" and thus to have himself and the dancers put into the "essential" category. It would have saved him from being called up. In addition, he planned to travel abroad to spread German culture and to defend it. Niedecken also managed to construct a so-called "First Program" of the German Dance Theater" to which he invited guests in October 1940. All directors of the Master Workshops had made their debuts with a First Program.

Goebbels expressed his satisfaction with it in the same way he had approved Laban's First Program. Then he changed his mind as suddenly and unexpectedly as he had with Laban. In that same October 1940, in the autumn after the Blitzkrieg victory over France, Goebbels had to bestir Schlésser to act against "doctrinaire dance." "He must eradicate the evil. Dance must address the senses and not the brain. Otherwise, it is not dance anymore but philosophy. Then I would rather read Schopenhauer than go to the theater."

In February 1941, Rudolf Kélling was the "right man" for Goebbels. With him, the minister settled the work of the new dance school beginning in April 1941—the new-old dance school with the new-old dance conception. Goebbels once again demanded beauty, grace, and body form. No danced philosophy! The Reich Minister had time to worry about these matters a mere two months before Hitler's Wehrmacht invaded the Soviet Union. Kélling had intrigued with skill and tenacity and had seized control of the Master Workshops. His main problem arose from Goebbels' refusal to define "philosophy in dance" but simply to react badly if he thought he saw it. That a lilting waltz did not fill a theatrical event caused the minister some distress. His aversion to plot in ballet, which never even came near enough to any philosophical considerations, made everything he saw an occasion for suspicion. This prejudice took ever more extreme forms. The result, which emerged from these reactions, was a kind of spiritual deficit in theater dance for which even Kolling could not compensate. Kolling's nomination as director of the German Master Workshops in light of his direct connection with the German Opera House restored the traditional principles for the structures of ballet schools. Now, at last, both the leadership and the pedagogical principles could really change. But did they really?

The new regime literally reversed all of Laban's maxims and techniques. He had never worked primarily for theatrical performance and resisted that whole way of thinking. He had, in fact, tried to infiltrate the ballet world with dancers who had his spirit and bore his message. The object was, in the long run, to dissolve traditional ballet. The great vocation of modern dance was, in the end, to replace the lifeless formalities of the traditional structures with the new, alive, authentic dance forms.

It was a bitter irony that one of his successors assumed control of a truly Labanesque creation—the "Master Places", the master workshops—in order to restore the hated traditional forms; that is, restore them with the measures Laban had initially taken. The reinstated link between ballet school and theater simplified and transformed the object and practice of training young dancers. For Kélling, a young dancer had to master the traditional ballet techniques and nothing more.

After Laban's Fall 141, Kélling received authority to train the new generation of dancers in the traditional way and to that end to found a new dance group. The school was given a more conventional name, "German Dance School Berlin", and a larger budget raised from 170,000 RM to 250,000 RM.'®" The examination rules, though, backbone of Laban's structure, remained unaltered by Kolling.

But it was not long before Kolling, Goebbels's favorite choreographer, fell from grace as the curious story of dance under the swastika took an utterly unexpected turn. A Ban on Dance

Goebbels announced "a ban on dance—a prohibition on dramatic ballet," which "eradicated" all dramatic, plot-based elements in stage dance. With the prohibition on all music by foreign composers—French, Russian, Soviet as well as all "Jewish" composers such as Mendelssohn—the repertoire of the ballet companies had been already much impoverished and had reached extremely narrow limits in terms of the works that could be played.'8§

As a result of the ban, the classics of nineteenth-century French Romanticism such as Giselle could not be performed and Tchaikovsky required a special permit. The Nutcracker clearly threatened the Third Reich. Goebbels insisted that the forbidden works be replaced by "worthy entertainment."

The intervention by the state produced inevitable delays. Even if the works submitted for approval were eventually certified safe for public performance, bureaucratic wheels ground more slowly than artistic ones. Repertoire planning became a nightmare and frequently could not be carried out at all. The incredible ban on the existence of plots or drama in dance works marked a kind of intellectual "dumbing down" of the German public and may have arisen from the unspoken wish to close off all thought and ultimately to strangle all authentic art.

The next stage was almost predictable. Goebbels put an end to dance as an artistic category. The German theaters were henceforth to offer "divertissements," reviews, pleasant little scenes, nothing gripping and nothing that involved commitment. In the history of dance, the entire evolution of the art from the courtly and enlightened entertainments to grand and compelling stage works was reversed. The following text is OCRed from a book.

Dance was once more a diversion, a background or accompaniment. The dismantling of ballet was nearly complete. The Ausdruckstanz dancers in their folly misunderstood the meaning of the darkening of the stage lights on the rival form. They hoped that once again their expressive German medium would have a monopoly of favor among the great satraps of the regime. Instead, they received a sharp warning from the ministry:

"Once again in the recent past, there have been renewed efforts to characterize the so-called modern expressive dance, a form much cultivated by individual dancers and small groups, as the real, authentically 'German' form of art dance in contrast to classical ballet or to stage dance in general. These efforts and views, in which the dying remains of a decaying individualistic dance mode and a specialized aestheticism conceal themselves, are to be strongly combated. '8? 142 Marion Kant

The ban on dance was at first caused by two works staged in late January 1942 by the Theater of the City of Essen and shortly thereafter by the Municipal Opera House of the city of Dusseldorf.'9° Sonja Korty, a Russian dancer and choreographer, who had belonged to Diaghileff's Ballets Russes for a while, had become ballet mistress in Essen in 1941 and continued to act in that capacity until 1945. Her crime seems to have been choreographing Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony. Tchaikovsky was, of course, the beloved composer of an enemy state. At the beginning of February 1942, the Intendant of the Theaters of the City of Essen received notice from the Propaganda Ministry that performance of such work was forbidden. Goebbels himself, assisted by Ministerial Director Leopold Gutterer, who had risen from section chief to state secretary and who went on to become general secretary of the film company UFA in 1944, and the Reich Dramaturge Schlesser, prohibited the dance interpretation of symphonic works as well as drama set to dance and indicated that the details of the ban were in preparation.'?! Schlesser submitted a draft of an edict two days later. The decree stated that "dance dramas" that reflected the artistic movements of the period after the World War were to be seen as undesirable developments. Dance had nothing to do with philosophy but should occupy itself with the joy of life and the pleasures of the senses.'°

An astonishing thing then happened and exceedingly rare in the Third Reich: the Intendant protested against the ban and the draft edict of the Ministry arising from it. Dr. Bauer tried to explain why choreographing a symphony was not only perfectly proper but an artistic necessity, if one was ever to escape the dreary conventions of ballet. He was told in no uncertain terms that he had no doubt expressed interesting views but he was forbidden to allow dances based on symphonies.'”? On the same day, a circular went out to all intendants in which Reich Dramaturge Schlesser absolutely forbade all "dance dramas" as the intellectual basis of any sort of experiments.!* As a result of the circular, the General Intendant of the Municipal Theaters in Dusseldorf saw himself forced to request special permission to stage Tchaikovsky's fourth Symphony, which was already well into its final rehearsals, and Sheherazade by Rimsky-Korsakov. The Propaganda Ministry wrote back "not permissible," in particular because the Intendant in Essen had asked why Dusseldorf could perform works forbidden in Essen.'°° The issue continued to rumble on. Dr. Bauer in Essen asked why Essen couldn't stage works permitted elsewhere. This concerned a Palucca work danced to a Beethoven sonata. Schlässel confirmed the ban on Palucca's performance in Essen and raised the question of whether something should be done about Palucca. The Ministry did nothing regarding Palucca, who continued doing as she chose.

In September, the Ministry received a excited letter from the General Intendant of the Municipal Theaters in Leipzig. Dr. Schiller, not surprisingly, couldn't believe that an entire art form had been cancelled. He advanced arguments to show that pantomime and plot had been used in various cultures for centuries and that they were necessary and organic intrinsic aspects of ballet. He pointed to the relationship between "dancing" and "playing." He admitted that there had been excesses and that alien, degenerate, and overly intellectual elements hostile to National Socialism had been seen in some ballets. Obviously, that must be eradicated, but not the whole of ballet at the same time.

This letter needed to be answered with caution. The general intendants of great theatrical systems in big cities like Leipzig, Diisseldorf, or Essen were not negligible figures. All enjoyed real artistic prestige. Dr. Schlässel and the Propaganda Ministry wanted to cooperate with them and not merely correspond by loudspeaker or by issuing decrees. The universal cry of protest from the intendants was unequivocal and unmistakable. Besides, in the National-Socialist State, a collective complaint to which a large number of leading artists added their voice, had an alarming, unsettling feel to it. Theaters were supposed to promote "folkish" ideas and German art. It would not do to alienate the whole theatrical establishment, so the stream of decrees and edicts would have to be reduced.

Schlässel modified the edict. Not all dance productions would be forbidden, only those that were "intellectually crippled" or worked against the stylized, artistically valuable folk dancing. Works like Don Juan by Gluck, Till Eulenspiegel by Richard Strauss, or The Creatures of Prometheus by Beethoven or The Doll Fairy by Josef Bayer or pieces by Werner Egk, Ottorino Resphighi, or Alfred Casella could be heartily commended. Choreographic and dance transformations of such works had been wonderfully achieved by artists like Rudolf Kélling and Pino Mlakar.

Werner Egk, one of the most devotedly Nazi of all German composers and head of the professional group (Fachschaft) of composers in the Reich Music Chamber, wrote a very agitated letter to Schlosser. He wanted to know the meaning of the abolition of an entire art form by bureaucratic decision. Had the Ministry considered that they were depriving many German composers of their property and income? Were there any wartime explanations for the otherwise inexplicable decision to destroy an entire art form?

To confound an already confused situation, the Reich Chancellery involved itself as well at the end of September 1942. The Chancellery demanded to know whether the rumors were correct that there would soon be no plot-based ballets in Germany. The Propaganda Ministry replied that the ban had been initiated at the express wish of the Führer; there was still a large gamut available from Max und Moritz to Joan of Zarissa in which "divertissements" could be danced around the world.

Under pressure, an anonymous civil servant in the Propaganda Ministry collected arguments for and against a ban on ballet. He traced the history of ballet and concluded that ballet and plots were inextricably bound, banning based on stories or plots would ban all ballet. The practical solution was for the Ministry to encourage "divertissements" and quietly tolerate plot-based ballets.

The bureaucrat confused genres, describing condemned tendencies in stage dance as "absolute dance." He mistakenly compared "absolute music" with "absolute dance," which had no connection to ballet. He also mixed up genres and added confusion to confusion.

By late September, the situation became a mess, needing immediate resolution. The theaters waited impatiently for the ministerial decision. It is unlikely that a universal consensus emerged within the ranks of the art-bureaucrats. The wave of protests must have worked. One can almost hear the grinding of teeth as the memorandum to the minister concedes the need for tactical retreat. Goebbels had to accept that “almost without exception really weighty objections were brought to bear” against his directive, and that it had turned out to be almost impossible to execute the directive in practice. The intendants received much milder instructions. They were urged to encourage more popular forms of entertainment, but the plot-based ballet would not in the first instance be prohibited. To be sure, the Reich Dramaturge reiterated his preference to see more performances of tried and tested works such as Don Juan or Max und Moritz. So the ballet problem found a solution worthy of its great traditions.

On the basis of the documents we have followed, the absurd twists and turns in ministerial policy on prohibiting ballet, a strong protest put an end to one of the most absurd of the many absurd and ham-fisted interventions by civil servants, dazed by visions of artistic power, in the life of a major art in Germany. If a protest could force the Propaganda Ministry to retract one of its sillier edicts, why had there been no protest against the dozens of other idiotic, crude, immoral and ridiculous decisions of those same civil servants? Was it really the case that the same people could summon up the courage to protest at the destruction of a type of art but not the destruction of people? Do we conclude that artists involved were ready to protest when the question was one of the life of art but not when it was "only" one of ordinary lives?

Total Dance

In the years that followed, Goebbels's edict was in reality carried out. Until the 1944 declaration of "total war," which meant the closing of all theaters, there were no stagings of well-known works and there were certainly no new choreographies. Although dramatic ballet was not formally forbidden, it just never happened. As the theaters were reduced to their rudiments, the decree became more not less effective.

In May 1943, three and a half years after the attack on Poland and exactly two years to the end of the "Thousand Year Reich," the Propaganda Ministry drafted some proposal for dance after the victory of German arms. The new form should be an entirely German expression, cleansed of all Western influences and ballet traditions, and based on the tried-and-tested "divertissement." German dance of the future, a "healthy dance," should be based on three factors: 1) point dance, 2) national dance forms, and 3) the expressive movement of the new artistic dance. Dance would, according to the draft, see its task as "the presentation of cheerful and lightly lilting bodily feelings. Philosophical abstractions, dramatics, "heavy" or symphonically choreographed interpretations would no longer be offered." The prohibitions themselves were victims of the war. If the ballet ban could not be carried out at once, it could at least be imposed after the war, which the bureaucrats still expected to win. After Goebbels failed to solve the "ballet problem," he confined himself to entirely practical interventions and requests for information: he wished to know if there were still dance companies in the theaters; whether dancers were still classified as "essential" for the war effort; how many male dancers could be made available to the Wehrmacht and whether it was possible to carry on with only female dancers in the companies. Investigations showed that practically all the male dancers had been called to service, but there were still twenty-five left to be called up. There were hardly any dance companies left worthy of the name. In addition to the German Dance Theater, there was still a “Strength through Joy” theater company under the direction of Friderica Derra de Moroda and the dance group of the Municipal Theaters of 146 Marion Kant Leipzig. There were a few remaining ballet masters and a few choreographers. The minister was told that a “remnant” of male dancers was essential to provide the solo pairs in the ballet, the same minister who shortly thereafter, on 18 February 1943, was to ask a crowd packed into the Sportpalast in Berlin whether they wanted a “total war,” to which they cried “yes.” Instead of the ceaseless quarrels with the real ballet companies in theaters, Goebbels transferred dance to the film studio and created a company that was to work only in cooperation with the Reich Film Chamber. The films employed dancers directly and without tedious contract negotiations with theater managements. Goebbels loved film in any case and in a studio he could make sure that any kind of light entertainment could be suitably done. Rudolf Kélling, Sabine Ress, and Tatyana Gsovsky were the favorite film choreographers for a new but empty genre. At this point it did not matter much that they were also the choreographers who believed in formal and abstract ballet, or in Tchaikovsky’s symphonies, and that they were the agents of what had wrongly been labeled “absolute ballet.” In March 1943, the German Dance School and the German Dance Theater were bombed for the first time. It was a total loss. Instruction could begin again in the summer, but it was not the old dance school. Kélling insisted on the importance of what was left and continued to teach undeterred. The raids over Berlin and other German cities continued and increased. As the German cities disintegrated into rubble and ash, dancers continued to dance; dance companies continued to tour and entertain the troops; some female dancers continued to expect the ministry to provide them with shoes and costumes. They continued to assert their devotion to the “national cause,” which they defended by dancing. After Goebbels declared “total war” in his famous speech in the Sport Palace, the theaters were finally darkened, but in their own ways art, theater, and dance were at once manifestations of the collapse of Germany and of its survival. In March 1945, the Propaganda Ministry ordered the closure of its German Dance School and the German Dance Theater. Artistic institutions, which had been founded as symbols of German modern dance, had ceased to exist. After the Allied victory in May 1945, all the agencies of the Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda were dissolved and the Ministry itself abolished. Except for mountains of paper, nothing was left of it.

Postscript: What happened to the dancers and choreographers who imagined themselves at the outset to be certain of the favor and benevolent interest of the National-Socialist grandees? Rudolf von Laban arrived in England, his second station in exile after Paris, in February 1938. In Paris, Laban had begun to “debocher” himself, to make himself “un-German.” Lisa Ullmann, an earlier pupil and his collaborator and companion in England until his death in 1958, made Kurt Jooss aware of Laban’s poor condition after she had met him again in Paris. It was Jooss who encouraged Laban to join him in Dartington, an artistic community founded by Dorothy and Leonard Elmhirst. With Ullmann’s help, Laban recovered his strength and began teaching. He also continued the process of redefining his nationality; he considered applying for a Czech and a Hungarian passport in order to get rid of his German passport. The communal atmosphere in Dartington enabled Laban to pick up the work he had begun in Ascona in 1914 and Homrechtikon near Zurich in 1915 and 1916, carried forth in Cannstadt near Stuttgart in 1920 and 1921, in Gleschendorf in 1922 and 1923, and finally in the capital of Nazi Germany, Berlin from 1933 to 1937. He continued to conceive of dance communities with devoted members serving in movement choirs, or modern dance choruses, as he called them now. He also never ceased to investigate the relation of dance to the spiritual world beyond conventional knowledge and trained teachers to carry his message forth. Together with Lisa Ullmann's help he founded the Art of Movement Studio in 1945 which became part of the Laban Art of Movement Centre in 1954. The Laban Centre in London today prides itself on being the most important place to study movement and dance in the United Kingdom.

Mary Wigman had to hand over her school to eager Nazi colleagues Hanns Hastings and Gretl Curth and in 1942 withdrew to Leipzig. On the suggestion and with the support of Hanns Niedecken-Gebhardt, she gave guest classes in modern dance at the Technical College for Dramatic Art. The Nazi Party of Leipzig refused to allow her to run the dance department. In 1942, at the age of fifty-five, she stopped dancing in public; in the same year, she appeared in a film with two of her solo dances and in an interview explained her artistic principles. On the whole, it was a disappointing year for her, she who always wanted to be the number one figure in German dance, which she had created. She never understood why the Nazis refused her offer. She identified herself with them and hoped for reciprocal recognition.

After the capitulation of Germany, which she considered a defeat and the greatest possible tragedy, she stayed for the time being in Leipzig, occupied first by the American Army and then by the Russians, reopened a school, and was wooed by the new communist rulers. She was invited to realize the idea of a higher college of dance in Leipzig. Because she never felt herself to be "Eastish" [“Ostisch”] enough, she left Soviet-occupied Germany and settled in West Berlin in 1949. She saw herself as a German in the traditional, conservative nationalist sense, and this national identification gave a certain character to her aesthetic postulates. Oddly enough, given her history, she was the only one of the leading dancers who made little attempt to conceal her past allegiance to the Nazi cause. But then she was never directly asked about her past, nor about her early political approaches to the regime and later involvement with it. Her friends entered a "secret unspoken of agreement" with her in which it was understood to "forget" about certain aspects of her past.2! Gret Palucca, a first generation Wigman pupil, who according to Nazi racial laws was "Half-Jewish," danced for the SS, who celebrated her as the "most German of all dancers."2!* In 1936 she received a special exemption from the racial disabilities from Hans Hinkel, who made possible so-called private performances, that is performances not ordered by the Nazi Party or other official institutions, but arranged by concert agencies or organized on private demand. In 1937 Goebbels had the exemption scrutinized but did not change it. With Hitler's agreement, Palucca's status was confirmed, despite her being labeled "too philosophical." She had to give up her school due to being half-Jewish. She continued to tour and perform in Germany and many European countries, including neutral Switzerland, until the bombing in 1944 made travel impossible. After the war, she quickly gained the confidence of the Russians, claiming that she, too, had been persecuted. She took advantage of the sufferings of others to establish a new relationship with power. In the coming decades, she determined dance politics in the Soviet Zone and later in the German Democratic Republic. She was the only modern dancer to achieve proper recognition in the new state and was able to establish her own school once more. In 1989, she was "thrilled to have the terrible time in the GDR behind me." The state agencies never inquired about her past or her participation in the politics of the Nazi State. She refused categorically to answer any questions about those years.

Harald Kreutzberg, the dancing ambassador of National-Socialist Germany, never had anything to do with politics. He only danced. He had not noticed that there was a war in Europe. While traveling through Europe, from Poland, the "General Government," to the Netherlands, he had always been warmly greeted. In Germany, he was loved by the film audiences who saw him act and mime in one of the great historical dramas, Paracelsus. He was astonished to learn that there had been war crimes and knew nothing about them. He was awarded the Federal German Service Cross. He had never been asked about his Nazi past.

Jutta Klamt directed her dance school in Berlin until it was flattened. As an enterprise declared essential to the war effort, she was permitted to reopen it in Mulhouse in Alsace in 1944. After the war, she demanded her denazification, since she had taken no part whatsoever in politics. On the contrary, she had suffered under the Nazis. Her membership in the National-Socialist Party was impossible to explain. She must have been threatened in some way. On the second appeal in 1949, she was finally cleared and built a dance school in Switzerland.

Johannes Gustav Joachim Fischer-Klamt, who engaged in transforming dance into a racial activity and collaborated with Rolf Cunz to subordinate dance to Nazi ideology, was denounced at the end of 1945 by another dancer and sent to the concentration camp Sachsenhausen, which was being used by the Soviets to intern Nazis. He died there from under-nourishment or a lung infection.

Rudolf Kélling, who of course never had the remotest contact with National-Socialist policies, worked in several theaters in the East Sector of Berlin and in Weimar, in the Soviet Occupied Zone. He moved to Munich because he could not live under communist rule. He was never asked about his past in Nazi Germany. No denazification process against him was ever undertaken.

Fritz Bohme, Laban's journalistic propagandist, stated that he had never been a Nazi nor had he anything to do with their activities. He only became a party member to avoid a worse fate. To help him establish his innocence, he collected testimonies from Carl Diem, organizer of the Olympic Games in 1936, among others, with the result that he was denazified in 1949. The newly established Academy of Arts in the GDR—Gret Palucca managed to become one of the founding members—he worked out a dance philosophy; together with Palucca, he advertised plans for a new “Tanzhochschule,” the first dance academy in East Berlin. He fought for the misunderstood German modern dance, which others had unjustly hindered in its development. Only modern dance could deal with contemporary problems. Ballet was unsuitable for that. If modern dance, Ausdruckstanz, was still misinterpreted and attacked, Bohme lamented, because of the corrupted press, and dancers who were foreigners—English, American or worse. And anyway, those journalists and dancers were all dominated and under the influence of ballet, according to him. Readers in 1951 would have understood the message: the international conspiracy against Germany deluded by the Jewish press. Who understands now? 150 Marion Kant Notes Part II Introduction

Mary Wigman provided important elements for this legend when, in March 1946, she publicly announced that the Nazi years had been a time of “schmissige Ballette,” “saucy ballets”, and “zack- ige Erotik,” “sassy eroticism.” Wigman in a “Demonstration fiir die Deutsche Zentralverwaltung fiir Volksbildung” in the Soviet Zone of Berlin. Berliner Zeitung 6 March 1946. German Expressive Dance (Ausdruckstanz) is and remains the one area where some work has been done. In the Berlin Academy of Arts in 1993, the exhibition Everybody is a Dancer gave a useful overview of the evolution of Ausdruckstanz in Germany from 1900 to 1945. Hedwig Miiller and Patricia Stéckemann produced a catalog under the same name. Serious discussion about Mary Wigman began with Hedwig Miiller’s biography, Mary Wigman — Leben und Werk der grossen Tanzerin (Weinheim and Berlin, 1986) and was enriched and deepened by Susan Manning’s Ecstasy and the Demon: Feminism and Nationalism in the Dances of Mary Wigman (Berkeley and Los Angeles/London, 1993). I have published several studies of Rudolf von Laban, Mary Wig- man, Gret Palucca, Marianne Vogelsang, Harald Kreutzberg, and recently of Josef Lewitan. Inge Baxmann’s study on the origins of the German dance community, Mythos Gemeinschaft. Kérper- und Tanzkulturen in der Moderne (Munich, 2000) and Laure Guilbert's dissertation Danser avec le IIe Reich. Les danseurs modernes sous le nazisme (Paris, 2000) have meanwhile been published. Suzan K. Moss’ Ph.D. thesis “Spinning through the Weltanschauung” (New York, 1988) was unfortunately never published. There have hardly been any attempts to critically analyze Laban and his work. See the articles by André Levinson, especially “The Modern Dance in Germany”, Theater Arts Monthly, no. 2, (February 1929) and those by Josef Lewitan, Alexander Levitan, Alexaner Verin frequently writing in Der Tanz between 1928 and 1933. Der Tanz was founded in 1927 by Josef Lewitan, a Russian Jew, and appeared from October 1927 on as a monthly journal. (There were few exceptions when the journal had a bi-monthly run.) Lewitan’s Der Tanz was “aryanized” in July 1933, and he was forced to emigrate. Joseph Goebbels, Der Angriff. Aufséitze aus der Kampfzeit (Munich, 1939), p.322 and p.329.

Hildegard Brenner gives an example of Rosenberg’s direct attack on Goebbels: “There is now a regular tug of war going on in cultural matters. Everywhere I go, there are unanimous complaints about the vagueness [Richtungslosigkeit in original — JS] of the Reich Culture Chamber. Every- body is clear about the jumble collected there. Old Jewish comrades as presidents, lawyers from the Rotary-Club in influential positions, useless ‘National-Socialists,’ in between some good people who feel more than uncomfortable. And then Goebbels’s empty speeches, mannered, without addressing the problems. It is desolate.” In “Die Kunst im politischen Machtkampf der Jahre 1933/34,” Vierteljahresschrift fur Zeitgeschichte, 10 (1962), p.33.

See Document 4 in Documentary Appendix. See Laban, ibid., and Jahrbuch des Deutschen Tanzes 1937, edited by Rolf Cunz and Joachim Gustav Fischer-K______ The exception was "swing" or "jazz dancing." The struggles about this form concerned, however, less the aesthetic criteria or technical aspects of the dance itself than the cultural, political, and ideological issues. See the case study in this volume, entitled "The Nazi Attempt to Suppress Jazz and Swing Dance." In this chapter I have omitted discussing the "nazification" of social and folk dance. I am conscious of the fact that a history of dance under the Nazis that claims to be comprehensive (which this study is not) would need to include this problem, not least because social dance under the Nazis raised vexed issues of the politics of youth and youth culture.

'Wigman trained under Emile Jaques-Dalcroze, the Swiss pedagogue, in Dresden-Hellerau. Following Francois Delsarte, he cultivated a musical education system, which he called "gymnastique rhythmique." In this technique, he translated musical rhythms into bodily movements to make music visible through bodily activity. Jaques-Dalcroze's Rhythmic Training Institute was incorporated into the Workshops for Artisanal Art (Werkstatten für Handwerkskunst).

The Labor Front tried to form professional categories (Fachschaften) for theatrical employees within the white collar divisions and thus attempted to gain influence over theater politics. The League of Choir Singers and the Association of Dancers should, therefore, have been included in the Labor Front. "The goal we have long sought is to unite all theatrical employees into one cate- gory and to manage them in their own Fachschaften. This goal has been realized by Party Comrade, Leader Dr. Ley." September, 1933, BA 50.01 237, p.117. The goal had by no means been real- ized: Karl Schénherr, for the League of Choir Singers and the Association of Dancers, protested vehemently on 3 October 1933 to the RTC about the Association of Theater Staff advertising for membership and coercing his members into changing organizations. The choir singers and associ- ated dancers had no desire to be united in the Labor Front. Cf. BA 50.01 237, Schénherr to Leers.

In August 1933, in Bad Kissingen, all the main organizations of social dancing joined to form one united association of all teachers of social dance. The adoption of Nazi racial policy by the three most prestigious modern dance teachers was not forced and took place well before the Goebbels Ministry made anti-Semitic regulations obligatory. Palucca dismissed her school director Tile Réssler, who emigrated to Palestine, while Mary Wigman dismissed Fred Coolemans, a Dutch-Japanese who was also partly Jewish. Coolemans had been one of her closest collaborators since 1927 and had run the school in Wigman's absence on her 1933 tour of America. Barbara Mettler, another Wigman collaborator, emigrated as well. See Laure Guilbert, Danser avec le Reich. Les danseurs modernes sous le nazisme, p.106, who cites 'Wigman's own papers to document the voluntary nazification of the school and to refute Wigman's and Palucca's self-justifications that they were "apolitiques." The Polish-Jewish dancer and choreographer Pola Nirenska claimed that Wigman dismissed most of her Jewish students immediately after her return to Germany from her American tour. See correspondence in BA 50.01 237, p.48. Desk officer Peterss complained in the name of Otto Laubinger to the Reichsbund zur Pflege des Gesellschaftstanzes (Reich Association for the cultivation of Social Dance) on 23 September 1933 that his good will had been misinterpreted and abused, and the agreement not kept. He emphasized that the Propaganda Ministry would in the future be very careful to supply any support to this organization. Johannes Joachim Gustav Fischer (or Vischer) -Klamt to Ministerialrat Laubinger, BA 50.01 237, 15 November 1933. With the reference to "our purely artistic activity," Fischer-Klamt, well aware of the fiasco caused by the Fighting Leagues's previous intrusions, was evidently trying to draw a line between himself and the organization. Letter from the dance school to Otto Laubinger, | July 1933, BA 50.01 237: "We hope that the possibility exists that the work can be performed in a representative place under the patronage of Herr Minister Goebbels. We believe that the entire dance world would greet such a recognition as a sign that Herr Minister had taken art dance into his range of interests." Marginal note by von Keudell: "It is not desirable that Herr Minister extend his patronage over a performance put on by a private dance school." See draft letter from desk officer Peterss, RMPEP, 44. Notes 153 to Jutta Klamt School, 21 August 1933: "I cannot unfortunately accede to your wish to assume the patronage of the work which you plan to perform on grounds of principle." BA 50.01 237. See the correspondence about the integration of dance teachers which unfolded as follows: December 1933, N.S. Teachers League and the Reich Fachschaft for dance teachers refused to be absorbed by the Propaganda Ministry and/or the Theater Chamber. February 1934: agreement between the Propaganda Ministry, on one side, and the Reich Ministry of Interior and the Prussian Ministry for Science, Art, and Volk Education to the effect that all associations concerned with dance or dance teachers belong in the RTC. An integration into the Reich Music Chamber was no longer an option. March 1934: communication from the Prussian Ministry to the Unified Association of Dance Teachers that their integration in the RTC was to take place according to the executive ordinances of the RTC Law. April 1934: Laubinger confirmed to the Prussian Ministry his claim to complete control of all professional organizations of dancers and dance teachers. According to the agreement with the Reich Ministry of Interior, there was no longer any question of an integration in the N.S. Teachers League. June 1934: another protest by the Reich Fachschaft for the Cultivation of Social Dance was submitted to the Prussian Ministry. The absorption of the N.S. Teachers League by the RTC was, they claimed, illegal. Dr. Ley had made a very different decision. The Fachschaft asked that the decision be reconsidered and that the claim for control of dance teachers be abandoned. The Prussian Ministry passed the protest to the Propaganda Ministry, where it was rejected. Further resistance was useless.

Laban had not included any explanations in his original German version. Gleschendorf was home to the Siedlung Klingenberg. The Klingenberg community was founded by a wealthy manufacturer’s son, Paul Zimmermann, on Great Pénitz Lake in Liibeck Bay. Zim-mermann, originally a teacher, left the profession and from 1903 on devoted himself to social-reform experiments, vegetarianism, and free body culture. Such ideas were already familiar to Laban who had practiced them in Ascona and on Monte Verita. In Klingenberg he was able to put them into practice in a different and wider context. Klingenberg gave him the opportunity to try out his ideas about “ceremony.” The Siedlung had already become famous for its elaborate celebrations of the solstices, to which a large number of racial cultists would travel. Specifically designed solstice sheets decorated with the swastika were produced on which special cultic solstice hymns were printed. The greatest of these summer solstice festivals occurred in 1922 and none other than Rudolf von Laban was the artist invited to celebrate the cult’s apotheosis.

The connection between futurism and dance raises a fascinating set of issues. Dance had played a small but not uninteresting role in Italian futurist development. The debate about bodily presence, sexual liberation, abolition of taboos between the sexes, and the necessity for a new dance as the new art of the body, had ended in disagreement. The futurist manifestos of the dancer Valerie de Saint- Point on these issues had been irritably answered by Filippo Tomasso Marinetti, the founder of futurism. The dancer was more or less expelled from the inner circle of the movement, her demands rejected and ignored. The claim to a "feminist" view of dance collided with male claims to sole artistic jurisdiction well before Italian Fascism and German National Socialism entered the fray. Mary 'Wigman had suffered a similar fate with her feminist dances. See the work of Susan A. Manning who built her study Ecstasy and the Demon: Feminism and Nationalism in the Dances of Mary Wig- man, around this problem.

The cases of Hanna Spohr and Heide Woog caused friction. Laban rejected Spohr as too old and too intellectual. That judgment earned him the lifelong hatred of Spohr, which went beyond per- sonal conflict. Spohr insisted that Laban retract his negative assessment, which she regarded as a personal affront and she demanded compensation. Laban refused. The conflict could not be settled or ignored. Spohr took her case to Goebbels directly, and it is just possible that the minister used this incident later to arrange Laban's dismissal. Heide Woog was sent by the local group Duis- burg/Hamborn of the Fighting League for German Culture and Laban judged her to be "compe- tent and suitable" for participation.

Memo from Ministerial Councilor Keudell to Dr. Goebbels, Dr. Greiner, Dr. Schlésser, Dr. Ott, Dr. Schmidt-Leonhard, Herren Hinkel and Moraller, ______ The following text has been cleaned up, with incorrect page numbers removed and the text separated into paragraphs:

In 1934, Rudolf von Laban, in his work "Deutsche Tanzfestspiele," discussed the politicization of dance and the differences between theater and Ausdruckstanz. After 1929, a debate took place, with the front lying across the artistic divisions between theater and Ausdruckstanz. Valeska Gert, Jo Mihaly, Julia Tardy-Marcus, or Jean Weidt criticized the exponents of Laban's and Wigman's German dance ideology. Gert, Mihaly, and Weidt were either active in the trade union movement or the Communist Party. In the January 1933 issue of Der Tanz, Alexander Verin strongly urged the dance community to recognize the political signs of the times. He argued that dance fell into two distinct groups: the believers in "absolute dance," Wigman and her followers Palucca, Triimpy and the rest, and the critical dance group. By 1934, Gert, who was Jewish but held a British passport, had not yet left Germany but had become completely powerless. Weidt had been arrested, badly beaten by the Gestapo and had emigrated to the USSR, and Mihaly had gone into exile in Switzerland. Like them, all the other critical or dissenting personalities had been silenced or expelled from the dance scene, accompanied by either enthusiastic applause or silence. The elimination of opposition ended discussion of the political responsibility of dancers.

For emigration and exile, refer to International Biographical Dictionary of Central European Emigrés, 1933-1945 (München, 1999) and Handbuch der deutschsprachigen Emigration 1933-1945, edited by Claus-Dieter Krohn et al. (Darmstadt 1998). In May 1935, ten dancers were granted subsidies to pay their living expenses. By December, fifty-five had received support. These numbers may be small, but they were symbolic of the new hope. By such means, Laban gained complete control of the dance world. By July 1943, 120 students were enrolled in the dance school.

In 1935, the dance school received support from the government. By July 1943, 120 students were enrolled in the dance school. The support from the government allowed the dance school to thrive and maintain control over the dance world. However, the small number of students enrolled in the school was symbolic of the new hope that emerged during this period.

The mask had been dropped in a letter sent out a few months earlier, in which the workshops were intended quite explicitly to become teaching workshops.

"T replied: I would find it impossible to dance in Germany at the present time. So many artists whom I respect and admire have been persecuted, have been deprived of the right to work for ridiculous and unsatisfactory reasons, that I should consider it impossible to identify myself, by accepting the invitation, with the regime that has made such things possible. In addition, some of my concert group would not be welcomed in Germany. They are Jewish. When I was told they would be perfectly immune, I said, 'And do you think I would ask them to go?'"

After 1933, he advanced rapidly as a professor and president of the Reichsinstitut für Geschichte des Neuen Deutschlands (Reich Institute for the History of the New Germany). He saw himself as the destined leader of German historiography, with the task of forming the soul of the nation in a Nazi spirit. In 1936, a special Research Department for the Jewish Question (Forschungsabteilung Judenfrage) was created within the institute and was directed by Frank. Conflict developed between Frank’s institute and a rival institute under Nazi party auspices, the Institut der NSDAP zur Erforschung der Judenfrage. Frank’s influence declined, especially after 1941, when Rudolf Hess, his patron, fled to England.

Wigman’s letter to von Keudell in the Propaganda Ministry is another attempt to clearly distance herself from anything “Jewish.” Wigman had operated with criticism as a “Jewish” vice long before the Nazis came to power. In 1929, in her response to Levinson’s article, she referred to Levinson’s sarcastic critique as “acid” and “destructive.” See Wigman in Die Tanzgemeinsschaft, no. | (1929), and Levinson’s “The Modern Dance in Germany” in Theater Arts Monthly, (1929), no. 1. There is a distinct history of equating criticism and critical analysis with “Jewish” destructiveness in German dance. Levinson or Lewitan would never be able to understand her dance because they “lacked Germanic orientation.” Her complaint to the Propaganda Ministry about the Braur article was the final blow for Lewitan who had tried to manage his journal indirectly and secretly and write small articles and reviews under pseudonyms or without signing his name. After Wigman’s complaint the journal was immediately and thoroughly “aryanized.” Letters from Marie-Luise Lieschke to Schlésser and Cunz, 2 February 1937, BA 50.01 247, p.38.

The Deutsche Tanzgemeinschaft (German Dance Community) had been founded in 1928 to counter Laban's Reich League. The Dance Community included Felix Emmel, Mary Wigman, Jutta Klamt, and Gustav Joachim Fis-cher-Klamt among its members. Thus in 1937 Wigman and Klamt met once again in common hostility toward Laban in the resurrected German Dance Community but, had very different ideas for the future of dance. In common was their demand to be the single source of authority over developments in dance. The exact text of the Ministry reads: “... It is impermissible to endanger the recently emerging clarification of dance to be threatened by the admission of representatives of out-of-date and antiquated pedagogic systems...” Laban had not been forbidden to exercise his profession, especially since he was encouraged to return to the visual arts but it was a public humiliation.

See Document 62 in Documentary Appendix.

A bizarre correspondence began in 1939 and 1940 among three agencies—the RTC, the Reich Literature Chamber, and the Police Presidium—about Laban's membership in the RTC and his whereabouts. The two chambers confirmed that Laban's membership number had not expired and that his membership remained valid. Besides, he was being sought and nobody seemed to know where he was living. The handling of the Laban affair after his departure is full of contradictions. On 3 March 1938, the Reichspressekonferenz released a note on Laban: He had fulfilled his artistic mission in the 1920s. Despite several attempts to discuss Laban over and over again the RTC considered the case closed. Laban had meanwhile settled in Paris—without any German help; he was no longer on a German mission. See Elke Fréhlich, “Die kulturpolitische Pressekonferenz des Reichspropagandaministeriums,” in Vierteljahreshefte fiir Zeitgeschichte, no. 4 (1974). On the other hand, on his sixtieth birthday in 1939 Laban was publicly celebrated as the “old master of German art dance.” See Berlin Document Center, File “Laban.” Questionnaire, December 1936, BA R 55 167, pp.77-89.

Also, there are no references to any arrest in the files. It is likely that Cunz, who would have regarded such an arrest as a triumph, would have drawn it to the attention of his superiors in the Ministry. Preston-Dunlop’s suspicion that a request from the Gestapo indicated that Laban was being persecuted is unfounded. On the contrary, the Gestapo provided Laban with a declaration that there was nothing against him, an entirely normal form of political clearance in Nazi Germany, which all other senior civil servants and leading artists had to receive, such as Keudell, Ebrecht, Cunz, Klamt, Bohme etc. Chapter 12 171.

Changes should arise from practical experience and would affect only a few points, in effect, improvements on a very sound foundation.

In October 1942, Kélling traveled through Germany inspecting the dance schools that Laban had intentionally scattered throughout various parts of Germany in the hope that they would disseminate his ideas. The Master Workshops were to function as Central School, and the regional schools were mirror images. Kélling though was distinctly unimpressed. The level in the schools was ridiculous, hardly up to the level of cabaret. Kélling decided to concentrate the training in the German Dance School Berlin and one or two other very selective schools, all strictly controlled by the RTC. Cf. Ba 50.01 245.

The term “absolute music” represents an aesthetic concept or aesthetic problem. It was, essentially, a German Romantic invention and evolved from writings of philosophers, novelists, and critics such as Novalis, L. Tieck, C. Brentano, F. Schlegel, J.G. Herder, W.H. Wackenroder, Jean Paul Richter, and E.T.A. Hoffmann. It stood at the center of aesthetic and philosophical debates of the nineteenth century as Roger Scruton writes, at “Hanslick’s spirited defence of absolute Tonkunst against the Gesamtkunstwerk of Wagner—and also in the abstractions of twentieth century musi- cal aesthetics.” He also points out “that it names an ideal of musical purity, an ideal from which music has been held to depart in a variety of ways; for example, by being subordinated to words (as in song), to drama (as in opera), to some representational meaning (as in programme music), or even to the vague requirements of emotional expression.” (Article “Absolute Music” in Grove’s Dictionary of Music 2000).

THE NAZI ATTEMPT TO SUPPRESS JAZZ AND SWING: A CASE STUDY
by Marion Kant

Jazz, Swing and the Nazis

Nothing better illustrates the war of all against all with the peculiar mix of madness and pedantic correctness at the core of Hitler's Reich in the years 1933 to 1945 than the problem of dancing to American jazz and swing music. The apparently trivial question of how ordinary people moved their bodies to American dance music became a matter of racial principle, an arena for political maneuver, a theater of the absurd, and a bitter struggle between the Police, the SS, and the Ministry of Propaganda. The Third Reich reveals its oddity in some ways more vividly in this minor issue than with its great crimes, in the face of which our horror at its bestiality masks the fusion of bureaucracy, ambition, social Darwinism, and sheer craziness, generated by Hitler's Reich.

The Nazi Party regarded the 1930s jazz style known as swing as deeply un-German. Its popularity among German young people disturbed them. The spread of the radio as a mass medium—a medium, encouraged by Nazi propaganda—made the situation acute by the late 1930s. Within the archives of the Goebbels ministry, the files, marked "Tanzverbot" (dance prohibition) survived the war. They illuminate the relationship of governmental, party and state institutions—in this particular case that of the Ministry for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda—to swing. One can see how a prohibition was put in place but not really carried out. As the German saying has it, "Der Berg kreisste und gebar eine Maus." [The mountain heaved and bore a mouse. - JS]

At first glance, dance seems so innocent and far removed from politics that it is hard to imagine how it could offend authority. Yet dance, the art of the body, had a significance that Nazi propaganda, with its emphasis on the beautiful, Aryan body, understood only too well. In the totalitarian system, the state claimed a total authority over its citizens, their minds and their bodies. Swing threatened that claim.

Rk Notes for this section begin on page 187.

168 Marion Kant

Soon after the Nazis took power on 30 January 1933, the ideological problem of swing and jazz music arose. Both swing and jazz, the music and the accompanying dances, were classified as "non-German" and as such "degenerate." Regulations for prohibition were proposed over the radio in October 1935:

[a final ban on playing Nigger jazz in the entire German radio station network [is planned]... What is uncreative and destructive, yes, what destroys the basis of our culture—all such things we are going to reject. We do not use plays from Moscow, which celebrate Bolshevism; we do not have room for Nigger jazz... From today onwards Nigger jazz is to be eliminated from German radio programs, regardless of the disguise in which it comes. For jazz there is in the future only one motto: Fall out to the left and off to Africa.]

Jazz and swing were to go the way of modern, avant-garde music, literature, and fine art. The Nazis declared them "degenerate" ("entartet"), because they did not fit the racist concepts of art. Books were burnt, and artists banned. Modern German Dance, as we have seen, never officially fell into that category of "entartet." This discrepancy of evaluating modern trends in social dance in comparison to so-called art dance is in many ways remarkable. Though at first sight there seem to be no direct connections nor any genuine interest between the two spheres—the high cultural sphere of art dance and the low sphere of popular entertainment—the great artists of German______ The cleansing of dance as form as well as social dance was generally undertaken by its own representatives. The difficulty with swing, however, was that the authorities hesitated to enforce a ban because they had no idea what they were actually prohibiting. If they could not define which concrete dance movements were "degenerate," it was impossible to prohibit this kind of dancing. But they could at least ban the music, which was easier to classify. Also, the politics of a ban had to be considered. Some Nazi officials wanted to rescue swing and jazz as entertainment for the masses. As a result, jazz became a subject of conflict between National-Socialist administrative forces, centralized in Berlin and other, mostly regional, National-Socialist interests. The conflict unfolded in a climate of irrationality and inconsistency in theory and in practice; it was in fact a mess.

From the beginning, Nazi jurisdiction was interpreted and carried out in different ways in the various geopolitical areas of the Third Reich. This applied particularly to prohibitions and bans. Not everything that was, in principle, forbidden was immediately eliminated or removed. Since, as we have seen, the Ministry of Propaganda with its Reich Culture Chamber gained administrative control of German art and culture, it had to define the link between Nazi ideology and each relevant art form.

The Reich Theater Chamber had created two Fachschaften [occupational groups or units] in which dance professionals were organized, one for the "stage," with a subdivision for performative, theatrical dance, and one for "dance," whose members were dance teachers or pedagogues of any kind, free dancers, movement choir directors, choreographers, members of community dance associations—in short, everybody not employed in a theater. The Einheitsverband Deutscher Tanzlehrer e.V. (the United Association of German Dance Teachers) became the central organization for the many existing associations of teachers of ballroom or social dances, tap dance, ballet teachers, pedagogues of free dance and so forth. It had been founded immediately after the Nazis came to power and integrated into the Ministry of Propaganda and its related organizations. Its main aim was to control and manage the dance scene, in this particular case the teaching of social dance and dance entertainment. Swing and jazz fell under its responsibilities.

Jazz musicians and swing dance instructors were both compulsorily enrolled in the Reich Culture Chamber, though in different sections. The logical agency to implement a ban on swing was the Association of Dance Teachers. They were the ones in touch with eager young people. They could provide and spread or restrict the knowledge and practice of dances. The necessary participation of the dance teachers was easy to achieve. These pedagogues by profession were keen to show their support of the new regime, keen to prove their loyalty. They did not pose an obstacle to the enforcement of a ban on swing. On the contrary, the teachers exceeded every expectation and demonstrated their National-Socialist beliefs by inventing methods to cleanse German dance. They created a climate for legal measures by providing the politically correct moral environment and suggesting possible actions. Not only had these people understood the mechanisms of Nazism and its politics well, they applied them in their own interests. Some of their ideas seem very strange today, but they were meant to be taken seriously. For example, the dance teachers suggested that those who performed a waltz incorrectly or in too fast a tempo—sixty bars to the minute—should be penalized by being sent to a concentration camp.* The demand for a radical cleansing of "racially alien" [“fremdrassischen” in the original text] dances together with a precise list of those dances to be banned came from dance teachers.> The request for decontaminating the profession by expelling all Jewish teachers came from dance teachers.® The offer to expel Jewish pupils from lessons came from dance teachers. The denunciations and defamations about the lack of an adequate "Aryan heritage," or about homosexuality or the liberal use of nude dances in bars, came from dance teachers. The teaching profession never hesitated to apply National-Socialist politics. On the contrary, many of the requirements were introduced by overly eager teachers keen to demonstrate their obedience.

If there were any reservations and if the idea of banning swing dance was questioned at all, then these arguments were discussed in and among the Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda, the local branches of the Reich Propaganda Ministry, the Ministry of Interior, the Reichsführer SS and Police, or the High Command of the armed forces. In the files of the Propaganda Ministry in Berlin, there is no evidence that dancers ever made the slightest effort to oppose their Nazi masters. 170 Marion Kant

The profession embraced Nazism with enthusiasm and without reservation. The only issue was how precisely to utilize the Nazi guidelines. As loyal and trustworthy allies, they stood by the Ministry of Propaganda in all matters concerning swing and were not only ready to do whatever the ministry decided but actively participated in "Gleichschaltung" [the contemporary term for the redirection of every activity along the track set by the Nazis - JS]. They advised the local offices in German cities and regions, freely joined the Kraft durch Freude movement [Strength through Joy, the name for the Nazi leisure program - JS], and operated as devoted Nazis themselves in many other ways.

The following account illustrates the mechanisms of the Propaganda machinery and shows how the prohibition of one popular dance form involved and set in motion the various forces in the Nazi State: The Ministry for Propaganda, the Police, the SS, the army. In the battle about swing or jazz dance, they took advantage of the opportunity to establish their realms and demarcate their spheres, meddle with the rival's affairs and interfere in his business; they played the power game with the issue "swing dance" as the ping pong ball hit from one corner of the table to the other. wk Ok

In February 1934, the State Chancellery of the Free State of Bavaria and its State Ministry of Interior issued a dance decree. During public dance entertainments that needed police approval, dancers were forbidden to act against "uncontaminated popular morality" ("unverfalschte Volkssitten"). Dancers were asked to keep in mind that they had to protect "genuine folk identity" ("echtes Volkstum"), and to take measures against the penetration of foreign elements" ("gegen das Eindringen fremder Elemente"), and against "degeneration" ("Entartung"). The police were advised to intervene if there were any signs of "degeneration." The State Chancellery had "false" folk dances just as much in mind as jazz dance, but in practice, the regulation aimed at jazz. The problem was that nobody had provided a clear definition of what jazz dance actually was or what it looked like. If nobody could say what it looked like, how was it possible to define unacceptable body movements? How were simple police officers to identify the insulting movements and take measures?

The Saxon Ministry of Interior turned to Berlin for guidance; it asked to have criteria for approval or disapproval of dance entertainments. The Saxon Ministry wanted precise definitions by which to classify dances as "German." In order to establish the "Germanness" of popular dances, in February 1935, the Reich Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda asked Rudolf von Laban, employed by the same ministry, to describe the elements of German Dance. Laban had somewhat earlier been named as the national overlord for dance by the Goebbels Ministry.

Laban's explanation offered three main arguments for the identification of German dances—geography, "racial essence," and social usage. His first element of recognition rested on a geographic notion: German was what had been danced in the "various German regions from olden times in traditional manner," and had been incorporated into German customs. He perceived dance as part of a heritage in which foreign influences had been ground or worn off and thus made into German cultural assets. German soil and land had embraced these alien inventions and turned them into something they had not been before.

Laban created a mythical historical evolution in which these dances, like migratory tribes, had traveled to German areas over the centuries. Though such dances had once upon a time arrived on German soil as "Lehngut" (borrowed assets), they had passed so deeply into the "flesh and blood of the German population that one could safely call them German dances, art forms that arose from German ways of life." The German tango was one of those borrowed and transformed assets.

The "nature of movement" and "movement forms" that "originate in, and represent, the German spirit," he concluded, would further inform definitions of German dance. Laban accepted waltzes, or "turning dances" ("Drehtanze") and running dances ("Lauftanze") as German dances.

In his second argument, Laban went to the heart of the matter. He turned from external factors to internal matters, to the "way of moving" ("Bewegungsart") and the "form of movement" ("Bewegungsform"). For Laban, "racial criteria" characterized dance movements, in particular "rhythm" but also "body posture" and the "way the extremities" are used. The "racial criteria" determined the "essence of German expression" (das deutsche Wesen) as much as they were a result of them. This "essence" in the end distinguished German dance from any other movement form.

The category "rhythm" in modern German dance had near mystical significance. For many of the theoreticians and practitioners of modern dance, for Laban or Rudolf Bode or Jutta Klamt, it was one of the crucial elements of a "racially" acceptable movement. Yet, as so often in Nazi ideology, whether in the fine arts, in music, literature or dance, it proved extremely difficult to define beyond doubt what actually constituted the "German" element. Nevertheless, Laban proceeded to identify "racial characteristics" in dance. Reflection on what is not German in dance will most quickly lead to clarification. By separating the “German” from the “non-German” Laban constructed a theory that defined what was not “German”. This was a method Alfred Rosenberg, Hitler’s chief ideologue, had successfully established in his book Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts. He had introduced an ideological construction with opposing groups of ideas or terms and thus documented that “German” was the opposite of “Alien”/”Foreign”/”un-German”—Jewish. Once the construct was in place, it was easy to build a hierarchy and justify whatever one wanted as “German.” Germany represented the positive, which had to be protected and rescued from the negative, which was threatening and had to be eliminated to save the positive. Laban adopted exactly this method when he wrote that clarification would be achieved by: reflection on that which is not German in dance.

Certain Spanish or Hungarian or indeed certain definitely Slavic bodily movements and rhythms are so foreign to the 172 Marion Kant essence of German expressive and cultural sensibilities that they could never be taken over and molded into German forms of dance. This applies to exotic forms of movement of more distant races such as Negroes, Indians, Mongols etc. Laban completely applied Nazi racial theory and Rosenberg’s polarization of good and evil, German and un-German to dance. He set an arbitrarily defined “German” characteristic against an equally arbitrary “un-German” feature. Since “German” remained elusive, it was hard to apply in practice. Laban could not, for example, define German folk dances, their historical development, their traditional stylistic movements, their functions and practice, simply in relation to other equally important dance traditions with a different national heritage. He—like Rosenberg—had to create a hierarchy; he too had to prove that German dances were better, racially superior, of higher quality.

The next step, and this the Nazis had made clear in their party programs right from the beginning, was the actual eradication of the “un-German,” dance, because it was inferior. At the same time as Laban was theoretically underpinning the Nazi desire to cleanse the dance scene in Germany, his colleagues were busily identifying the un-German social dance forms and eliminating the unacceptable excesses. Laban found a third distinction by examining the social usage of dances. He suggested that folk dance should no longer be separated from social dance because social dances had in fact become so popular that they already were a form of folk dance.

The idea that folk dance would disappear and be replaced by a particular kind of social dance was one of Laban’s favorites contemplations. He had always hoped that his movement choirs would prove to be the future form of social dance, a united and unifying folk/community socializing through movement; his hope was that they would form the basis for a completely new dance form, one that “wants to promote something, aside from the immorality for our race.” Naturally, the dances of the 1920s Western societies disgusted him. They were nothing but erotically challenging decorations and frivolities. At a course for dance teachers in Halensee in 1926, he warned: “I do not want to see any institute with my name on it in which social dancing is taught ... This four-legged shoving back and forth across the floor is not dance at all but degeneracy. It’s a sort of mixing up of two wills, indeed two wills of different genders, which I cannot see as agreeable. "In a lecture at Berlin University on 1 April 1928, he had emphasized his view again in public: “Personally I have everything to say against the present forms of social dancing.” Jazz dance was “nigger dance, jewified and spoiled by American-ization.” He proceeded to sketch the basic body movement of the white race on which the new dance could build. “The picture that we have of the most natural movement for the white race, is roughly the sideward movement.” '4

Shortly after that insight, he doubted whether “the Negro is capable of inventing any dance at all. If one hopes to find any kind of Negro dance culture [in the United States of America — MK], one is in for a big disappointment. A gift for dance-invention as well as the higher development of the other arts and sciences seems to be the privilege of other races.” That the “white race has re-adopted distortions of its own dances” proved how rotten Western civilization had turned. Most important was, that there were men with a vision. Laban belonged to those men with a vision and he designed his own new social dance as the art of movement that reflected the true rhythms of life of the “Master” race. Thus his proclamations about the “Negro Unkultur” merged with the attacks by the Nazis on jazz and swing as racially unclean and harmful to the white race.'®

In his outline to the Propaganda Ministry Laban finally concluded that today waltzes and running dances from the area of so-called social dancing can be certainly accepted as German dances, insofar as they are performed in the German way and to music that corresponds to the sensibilities of the German Volk. Music, of course, did not correspond to the sensibilities of the German Volk. The National Socialists had emphasized this long before January 1933. With an apparently scholarly justification, Laban offered an important apologetic argument for the prohibition of jazz and swing in both musical and dance entertainment. Though his definition was not immediately applied, it did have a long-term effect and was to be important for other reasons. His definition became a valuable means of orientation when the matter was hotly debated.'®

Laban provided the prohibition of swing and jazz as “Nigger and Jew dance” with a pseudo-scientific basis. Nobody forced Laban to provide these definitions. He was only too eager to lend his expertise to the Nazi project to purify German culture. Once artists had created the intellectual foundations, they could be utilized by the administration, the police force, or the SS to evaluate dances, to ban or encourage them, or to employ them in their Nazi propaganda. Though there was now a definition at hand, the Ministry of Propaganda nevertheless behaved cautiously and did not start a cleansing action at once.!? For some time, the debate seemed to quiet down. Once in a while, it emerged in small squabbles. In general, the ideas of dance teachers about a truly German social dance were regularly published in the relevant journals, but they did not have any apparent influence on the reality of dancing nor on the choices made by young people. The preferences of the young generation were obvious; they loved swing and jazz music, and swing and jazz dance. ok Around 1938 the situation changed, whether because radio listening had spread the popularity of swing or because the likelihood of war had stirred the Nazi rank and file is not clear." Suddenly, administrative attention focused once again on "degeneration" in dance and entertainment music. Decrees and injunctions were instigated mostly from below and sent up to the higher ranks of the hierarchy, not the other way round as one might expect. In particular, local police stations were eager to curry favor with party institutions in Berlin. It was these local forces that pressed for a decision, the more extreme the better. Yet Berlin hesitated. At the end of the year 1938, a new initiative from North Germany demanded a complete prohibition of jazz music and jazz dance.

The Secret State Police, the Gestapo in Kiel, reported to the president of the Government in Schleswig that they had observed an overwhelming increase of American dances, in particular swing. These "completely un-German dances" had become a public offense and needed to be banned. Though there already was an ordinance in place forbidding swing, set up by the local professional association of the Nazi organization of tavern and restaurant owners, it was apparently not observed.

The Gestapo bureaucrats in Kiel pointed out that the Gauleiter in Stettin and the chief of police in Freiburg/Breisgau, two different areas in the Reich, had issued formal police orders. The authorities in Schleswig asked their superiors in Berlin for permission to regard such orders as models; they hoped that these rules or something similar could also be applied in Schleswig. Ideally, it was hoped that a general order for the entire Reich would be promulgated.

The demand for a unified regulation for the entire Reich, or even better a Reich-wide ban on such dancing, came up again and again in the following years. The chief executive of Schleswig-Holstein told the Reich Propaganda Ministry's local office in Schleswig-Holstein that a regulation would soon be promulgated. A few days later, at the beginning of 1939, he asked Reichsführer SS and Chief of German Police Heinrich Himmler at the Ministry of Interior in Berlin whether a unified order for the Reich was in prospect and how he should proceed in the meantime.

At the same time, the administration of Upper Bavaria in Munich was asked to extend its very effective ban on dancing. Nevertheless, in many areas, there was still confusion about how to proceed. The Reich Propaganda Ministry local office in Mainfranken inquired at the central propaganda office in Berlin about who had authority to issue bans and how far they should go.

The request eventually reached Rolf Cunz, who worked in the Theater Department of the Reich Ministry of Propaganda and Popular Enlightenment under the direction of the Reich Dramaturge, Dr. Rainer Schlässner, and who was also the desk officer for dance. As we have already seen, Cunz had been instrumental in removing Laban from supreme leadership in dance in Germany in 1937. Cunz scribbled in the margins of a ministerial minute: "How is this to be answered?"

The Reich Theater Chamber had already issued a directive, the so-called "Swing Ban" for the radio. Several departments VI (Theater) and X (Music) in the Propaganda Ministry were, Cunz pointed out, considering measures against swing as well as a definition of the permissible limits of dancing. All those involved understood the basic rule of thumb: "In the end, how people actually behave will decide the question." In spite of the complaints, the Propaganda Ministry did not consider swing all that threatening. As a result, it gave no answer to the local offices who were agitated about the issue of banning swing. In practice, the musicians of jazz and swing bands and their dancing fans chose both the type of music played and the way it was danced to. Local propaganda offices in the different provinces could only look on suspiciously at behavior they could not prevent. They kept pressing the Reich Ministry in Berlin to finally take an unequivocal stand. Local bans and police ordinances multiplied on a regional level quite unsystematically. The situation resulted in irregularities, because there were no centrally administered rules, a messiness intolerable to German bureaucrats. Not only did the Reich Ministry lose any oversight of the situation but ran the risk of losing influence on the whole question.

The Reich Ministry of Interior, responsible for police and public order, complained more and more loudly because the Reich Theater Chamber, which was subordinated to the Goebbels Propaganda Ministry, did not react to requests for clarification and never answered letters. At the same time, several local Propaganda Ministry offices launched campaigns in the press against “this degenerate dance.”2 After they had been running for some months, pressure to act began to build up in the Reich Ministry for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda in Berlin. Articles and appeals were being directed at both press and radio officials.

The Reich Station Hamburg was criticized for its New Year’s program in 1938/39 because, although the station played the Blue Danube, it was accompanied by the remark that this was music for the older folks. That was followed by music quite explicitly aimed at the young. The police and SS complained that one could hardly believe one’s ears. It was difficult not to think one was in Africa. Such music was bound to lead to “un-German behavior.” The complaint continued by asserting that even in music it was necessary to enforce a really German outlook and make sure it was broadcast properly. Such an outlook rested on “the cultural inheritance and creative powers of the Volk and the appropriate Germanic decency, which emerged from it.” The authorities expressed the hope that “dance music, which erodes the Germanic outlook ... would in the new year be eliminated from the broadcast schedule, in order to ensure that German culture can develop freely.”24

“American Nigger dances like Swing, Hot, Big Apple, Lambeth Walk” had no place in National-Socialist Germany. On 10 January 1939, in central Germany, the press initiatives finally achieved something. A newspaper reported that an accord between the Reich Music Chamber and the Economic Chamber had been reached, which foresaw a further ban on “Nigger music and Nigger dance” and that “this plague” would be “rubbed out,” a characteristic Nazi expression. The article went on to explain where the plague began: It is the Jewish band leader Goodman who had ‘invented’ this mixture of the primitive sensuality of Negro rhythms and Yiddish emotions. This Jewish scum is the father of these twisted body motions dripping with sexual overtones. The article continued by making a ringing appeal for a renewal of racial purity, which must, of course, include dance as an important expression of the common life of the Germanic race. Most officials were acutely aware that a return to genuine folk dance as a substitute for modern entertainment dances was very unrealistic. Neither the Schuhplattler [Bavarian and Austrian popular dance performed in traditional costume with much slapping of knees, thighs and bottoms—MK] nor the waltz would be accepted as youth culture.

Some Nazis hoped that it might happen, but the “realists” recognized that they would be more successful if “racially questionable” practices like swing could be integrated into Nazi culture. It was merely a question of eliminating 176 Marion Kant "excess." In any case, there would have to be a consensus on a generally acceptable German dance, which, as a journal article observed, "reflects the true emotional life and soul of our Volk, is original and is rooted in our traditional heritage." This demand could neither be met by folk dance alone, nor by social dance; both forms would have to submit to other requirements: They would have to: scrape off the inferior, pull out the valuable elements, and unify themselves into something new. One does not want to invent a world view embodied in dance but ensure that general attitudes, which underpin our Weltanschauung and govern our public life, should also be present in the domain of dance2> At the end of January of 1939 the Gau student leader Dr. Scherberger asked the students of Heidelberg University to observe the ban on swing. These alien dances, he announced, were incompatible with Germanic nature and National-Socialist beliefs. Students should dance and should not only concern themselves with the serious questions of science. But the value of dance has not yet been measured for the people who perform them. Here too the German student faces the task of stopping moral degradation in dance and eradicating those dances, which have been identified by Movement° [the combat journal of the NS student association — MK] as "fundamentally primitive, sensual, bestial and appealing to the subhuman [an den Untermenschen]."2" The journal SA-Mann sometime later reprinted a passage from another magazine Hakenkreuzbanner,"® which combined brutality with racist anti-Semitism: Swing was not dance, it was "degeneration." Jew press and Jew publishers who routinely support and encourage niggerlike combat culture have instigated a real swing circus, which is beyond belief. We Germans have not produced any Mozarts of swing music and, thank God, we will not have any. We are of the opinion that the art of Mozart and Beethoven stands in relation to Swing and Lambeth Walk like folksong to popsong or kitsch. Nobody could miss the point of this rabid condemnation of swing and jazz. Up to the years 1938/39 members of the SS and officers of the Wehrmacht were the only people expressly forbidden to listen to swing or jazz. The police orders and decrees, which were filed under the heading "banning swing," were aimed at "excesses" and "distortions" in dance practice, not against the dance itself. Besides, judgments about when and how dancers and dance were alien to the German essence were difficult to verify and at no point adequately defined. As party member Rolf Cunz had quite rightly suggested, it was the practice of dance that decided on the reality. That practice—again and again—had made any ban or prohibition look ridiculous and undermined any orders. The hope of the Reich Propaganda Ministry local offices and the police was to eliminate the practice. The Ministry of Propaganda in Berlin, though, had no intention of reinforcing orders that did not work. Officials were not interested in undermining actual dancing any more than necessary. The conflict among the agencies, so typical for the Hobbesian world of Nazi bureaucracy, led to uncertainty in the treatment of swing and jazz. Another report from the Berlin Ministry of Propaganda, this time from Silesia, pointed out the existence of crucial discrepancies in the circles of party comrades in the evaluation of swing, even more so with the Lambeth Walk. The author wrote, "In 1933, the German dance scene was cleansed in a rigorous but healthy way of all excesses of Negro dance forms. I do not understand why this point of view cannot be extended to get rid of those other dances. It is illogical to make fun of American dance extremes (Big Apple, Peel the Peach, etc.) in the press and yet allow these dances to be performed. That simply provokes those unpleasant scenes which we have just ridiculed."

If certain circles of "society" sustain the opinion of the magazine Elegante Welt that the Lambeth Walk is a century-old English folk dance and even provide academic evidence, we are in a very odd situation. The same circles that so passionately defend an alleged English folk dance are not interested in dancing German folk dances at all. They would find it absolutely inappropriate to perform a Bavarian folk dance in dinner jacket and evening gown. In addition, the pop song to which this dance is executed has nothing melodic in it; it consists of pure rhythmic music only.

What was to happen now? The official asked. The Reich propaganda office in Silesia did not want to pre-empt the decision of Minister Goebbels: after all, he alone had the right to issue a formal ban. In Silesia, it was known that the dances in question were part of social occasions in Berlin and that people in high places in government and party enjoyed dancing them in public. After several days of thinking about the matter, Herr Cunz came up with an ideal solution: The dances should not be forbidden, but the English verses should not be sung any more. Could the Reich Propaganda Ministry local offices in the various regions be informed? He asked. In any case, he noted that this was a problem for Minister Goebbels's personal decision, and that the Minister would also notify the Führer. Clearly, the Führer would have the final word on what was or was not an acceptable dance for Germans.

The uncertainty among the agencies of the Nazi State increased the importance of the subject and made it more and more pressing. It was pushed from office to office and ushered to the next higher level until there was no higher stage to reach. Why was Nazi totalitarianism, not known for its tender conscience, unable to make up its mind on a relatively minor issue of cultural policy? A simple ban would have put an end to the whole question. Can the delay in promulgating a general Reich decree be interpreted as a sign of bureaucratic uncertainty or even uneasiness?

One branch of the hierarchy was growing impatient; the police and the SS. They were particularly furious about the way jazz and swing musicians disguised themselves with false beards and funny noses when they were playing swing and jazz music. They wanted to prevent "growling" mutes on brass instruments and in general what they called "wailing." They wanted to forbid the immoral contortions of the body and encourage dances with less erotic movements. These advocates of Germanic breeding wanted to eradicate "degenerate elements" and promote German art. The Ministry of Propaganda was not interested. It refused to acknowledge the disguises and had no interest in growling trumpets and wailing saxophones. They ignored what they did not want to deal with. The crux of the problem was that the Goebbels Ministry realized that a younger generation, hungry for its own culture and eager for its own music, could be intimidated or put in jail or concentration camps. However, finding an adequate youth culture to replace it was impossible. Entertainment—suitable, agreeable, enjoyable entertainment—was more important than ideological purity. The police were not going to supply fun for the young, so the Goebbels Ministry had to do that. It was responsible for leisure, pleasure, and fun in the Third Reich as well as for the darker side of propaganda, the battle against “degenerate” art.

The bureaucrats probably reckoned that eradicating jazz and swing not only prevented an enjoyable amusement but more importantly, robbed the Ministry of the means to control and entertain large parts of German youth, in particular the urban youth. The dilemma of how to ban the forbidden and leave the rest could not be solved. Nobody had found a reliable substitute for swing. The clumsy campaigns from 1933 onwards to launch suitable German “folk dances” had always gone wrong. German “folk dances” that were accepted by a wide public were never invented, and the campaigns were not successful in pioneering new social dances. The experts knew that “folk dances” would never satisfy an audience that wanted to dance to the newest fashion. For a generation rebelling against its fathers, a prohibition only made the dancing sweeter and more attractive. Even the police should have known that.

All attempts to initiate “German” social dances had miscarried. Those dance teachers who regarded the Anglo-Saxon foxtrot as permissible in the Third Reich had been proven right. The Ministry of Propaganda now had to avoid an unambiguous prohibition and struggled to find reliable boundaries between the tolerable and the intolerable. It was not a compromise but an effort to control music and dance practices more reliably. This too went terribly wrong.

The Ministry of Interior, the institution that supervised SS and police forces, insisted on a formal decision. It referred to the demands of the various local police administrations in the country. They needed an unambiguous decree to get rid of swing music, swing dance, and, if necessary, musicians and dancers. The reactions from the Propaganda Ministry were hesitant and vague. In principle, the Ministry appeared to agree but never really took any decisive action.

In February 1939, the deputy Gau [party district in Nazi terminology — JS] leader in Baden, Réhn, wrote a letter to the head of the party chancellery in Berlin. He urged that the unity of the Nazi Party be restored and that all its subdivisions agree on questions of swing music and dance. Discrepancies in attitude would lead to inconsistencies in action and generally confuse the local authorities of party and police. Réhn insisted that the Gau leader had no right to issue specific bans on individual dances. The Propaganda Ministry and the Reich Culture Chamber were in sole charge of all bans and prohibitions. The Ministry and the Culture Chamber were responsible for getting dance teachers to toe the line and laying out unmistakable and unequivocal rules. Réhn too was of the opinion that prohibitions in this area would achieve nothing. A different development could only be initiated by introducing other nice and appealing social dances. The character and individuality of persons are displayed while dancing, and I have established that all those English and American contortions have had no influence on the mass of people who love to dance. To prohibit a dance, which is already accepted and performed by hundreds of thousands of people, I regard as politically unwise, in particular, if the prohibitions are issued by incompetent authorities!*” The letter from Réhn reached Reichsleiter Martin Bormann, deputy head of the Nazi Party, and he now interfered, addressing a letter to “dear comrade”®! Goebbels and assuring him that the local offices were right to anticipate a uniform ruling from the Ministry of Propaganda. Goebbels could be expected to promulgate the rules for dealing with swing. Of course, Bormann argued, these dances played a completely different role in the cities than in rural areas, but it was fundamental in the light of the fact that the Führer had voiced his view and said that it would be completely wrong to take on dances of our worst enemies, the English and Americans. No doubt these dances have changed notably, yet for precisely this reason one should not keep their foreign names. Besides, we think that good German dances can be developed and it should then be fairly simple to introduce them as modern German dances via stage, film etc.* This letter must have confirmed the attitude taken on by the Ministry of Propaganda anyway: a verbal ban against swing music and swing dance had existed for several years—it did not need to be carried out with the help of Himmler’s police. Instead, it would be better to find a mild, more acceptable form of this so immensely successful entertainment. That meant—the newest interpretation—either renaming the original English titles and/or finding a German dance that would mould itself on the English model and could then be easily popularized and advertised through the film medium or songs. Unfortunately, mere renaming was far too little action for the Ministry of Interior. The bureaucrats there protested that the existing practices would just be confirmed and the police, who had fought a bitter battle against any loosening of the injunction, would be frustrated. The Ministry of Interior, therefore, protested vehemently and asked for more support in suppressing swing and more and clearer decisions by all the authorities involved, not less and vaguer. “Success could be achieved,” was their slogan. The Ministry of Propaganda, on the other hand, was much more aware of the fact that it had also failed miserably to create new German dances. So, an additional memorandum was added to the many others already waiting in files and gathering dust. The entire development was summarized, objections recollected, and suggestions repeated. The civil servant for dance in Department VI reported to the state secretary that, yes, an immediate decision was in demand and needed to be sent to the Reichsführer SS and Chief of the German police, as well as to the local offices of the 180 Marion Kant Ministry of Propaganda, but a prohibition that would cover the entire Reich was practically impossible to put through. Experience had shown that one could not draw a line where swing dance began or ended. Did, for example, “swinging arms enthusiastically” indicate swing dance or not? Or was one talking of “convulsions and contortions”? The most one could do was to ask, occasionally, that Department X, the Music Department, once more issue a regulation forbidding the playing of “certain dance music, which originates from questionable sources or causes unwanted effects. "It remained the job of the police to intervene in individual cases and prevent degeneration in dance sites on the grounds of public nuisance. But the police did not have the right to issue any kind of decree or ban. The instructions 'Extremely urgent' (Große Eile) and 'for rapid reply' (Beschleunigte Stellungnahme) and 'Reichsführer SS has to be informed under all circumstances immediately' (Reichsführer SS muß unter allen Umständen sofort unterrichtet werden) were added to the text of the note—and then it was left lying in some office for a month.

From Department X of the Ministry of Propaganda came another comment on the problem of Lambeth Walk and swing. Would the other departments, please, withhold their ironic remarks? After all, there was a ban on the Lambeth Walk, issued by the Reich Office for the Examination of Music (Reichsmusikprüfstelle). This ban applied to certain styles of 'hot' and 'ice' instrumentation. Nothing could be done musically against swing dance because it could be performed to other music just as well. In fact, swing dance was not dependent on swing music. Within the confines of the Propaganda Ministry, it could be said that the prohibition was ineffective because the President of the Reich Music Chamber had not followed his own instructions for more than a year and did not pass on the respective orders.

In effect, the Music Department, annoyed and ridiculed, blamed another administrational instance and thus thought it had got rid of its responsibilities. A general set of Reich orders, bans, or directives was simply not issued. The presidents (Oberpräsidenten) of the provinces, Reich plenipotentiary (Reichsstatthalter), and other important personalities of the party districts and the provinces notified the Ministry of Propaganda that, while they were still waiting for a general order, for security reasons, they had already taken action against the unbearable situation in dance and musical entertainment, swing, hot, Big Apple, Lambeth Walk, and the like.

From Pomerania, Thuringia, and Saxony came the update that the authorities were proceeding 'with sharpest measures against the deformations and twists of our contemporary dance style.' At the same time, the presidents of the provinces had to confess that there had been certain improvements in the situation, although one could not speak of the complete disappearance of American dances. With some resignation (or was it realism?), they concluded that a 'complete disappearance' would probably never be achieved.

On the basis of the legal framework established by the Reich Culture Chamber in 1933, the Pomeranian local office of the Reich Propaganda Ministry and the representatives of restaurants and clubs owners in the district could agree on some measures in late 1938. These ordinances were designed to ensure that 'racially' advantageous, 'German' conditions would exist in dance halls and be enforced by police action:

1. The band leaders and musicians under contract are to withdraw from the reproduction of foreign popular music, insofar as possible.
2. 'Hot' playing, excessive wailing, growling, and drawling on their instruments and standing while playing were forbidden. The musicians were to execute their parts exactly as written.
3. If songs were played, they were to be sung only in German versions and German interpretation. It was forbidden to play popular songs in the English or American way or to use foreign words." 4. The musicians were forbidden to wear costumes, false beards, wigs, etc.
5. Encores, so-called “tails” (Schwanzchen), should be omitted if possible; only one encore after each dance was permitted.
6. The owners of taverns and restaurants were responsible for the playing of predominantly German dance and entertainment music on their premises.
7. The owners of taverns and restaurants or their representatives were to forbid the dancing of swing dances and to ban those couples who performed them from the floor.

Owners of taverns and restaurants who do not fulfill the above-listed demands have to reckon that their locality will be struck by the relevant authority from the list of places suitable for visits by holders of party offices and formations. Members of the Wehrmacht will be asked to observe the ban. Band leaders and musicians who violate their contractual obligations have to reckon with a fine or an exclusion procedure on grounds of unreliability according to Paragraph 10 of the First Regulation of the law of the Reich Culture Chamber dated 1 November 1933.

Thus another attempt, born out of obstinacy and arrogance, was made to deal with the jazz phenomenon by using fear and intimidation. The individual, the owner of a tavern or musician, was to be made liable for keeping regulations in place, which had neither been described precisely nor were capable of avoiding ridiculous application. Pressure was put on the weakest links, the musicians and club owners, and punishment threatened if a border line in dance, that nobody had precisely fixed, was not respected. As party comrade Cunz had asked, where did the limit of tolerance actually lie? Were “swinging arms enthusiastically” and “convulsions and contortions” illegal?

In Bochum, Westfalia, the president of the Police Authority declared that there must either be a general regulation for the whole Reich or, until that was issued, he would do nothing against swing in his area. As the Reich stations of German radio were still broadcasting swing music, he did not understand why it should be up to him to forbid it. He added: Swing and swing-like dances are ... being played without restraint during this year’s carnivals in Berlin and Munich, even for representative balls. Leading men of government and 182 Marion Kant party were present. It obviously only depended on who was dancing and how. I regard it as unnecessary to declare a general prohibition because a few people transgress decency. He concluded by pointing out that Bochum had witnessed no indecent or immoral excesses nor any repulsive dance scenes.*”

To measure where indecency began was, after all, dependent on highly subjective criteria. In Bochum, a highly industrialized area, one was not inclined to let subjective judgment rule. The months passed; the Reich Ministry of Interior sent reminders, asking for a final decision and a final ban. The Ministry of Propaganda put them off and noted: “Again a letter asking for decision,” and, “I have not seen any decision at all.”38 Nobody in the Ministry of Propaganda took any decisions that had not been taken already anyway and were publicly accessible. The civil servants promised the Reichs- leader SS to find solutions and just left the problem lying. In February and March 1939 the Propaganda Ministry concluded once more that the Lambeth Walk was “in essence quite harmless, yes even partly childish”.*° The Ministry of Propaganda took the view that it was easier to ignore what was happening and simply tolerate swing dances. The police handled the affair as they had so far. The problem of a dance prohibition would solve itself by inattention. Everything could remain as it was. Practice would determine reality. Decisions could be delegated; subjective interpretations could govern police behavior. In the cities, all sorts of dancing were accepted anyway; in rural areas, German "folk dances" were commended instead of swing. It was an irregular but sensible way to proceed. More time passed. Germany prepared for its second World War with swing and jazz in its knapsack.

At the end of May 1939, the Reich Theater Chamber and the Reich Music Chamber discussed "degeneration in dance" once more and proposed a new solution to control it:

"Certain phenomena in social dancing, in particular, the introduction of some new foreign dances, which are not consistent with the principles of a racially conscious culture, are a good reason to make the circulation of new German and foreign dances dependent on a certificate of non-objection. Such certificates will be communicated in the 'Official Information' leaflets (Amtliche Mitteilungen) of the Reich Music Chamber and the Reich Theater Chamber and made available to musical journals. Until a certificate of non-objection is issued, any propagation of this kind of dance—by publishing, circulating or performing and by teaching or demonstrating it—is forbidden. German dance bands are notified hereby that it is shameful to sing foreign words to dance music. Anyone who does not obey these instructions must reckon with the measures provided by the legislation of the Reich Culture Chamber.*° This solution could not work, because it was unenforceable. Local Reich Ministry of Propaganda offices refused the suggestion that they were "under" the authority of the Reich Theater Chamber. They were not bound to issue any such certificates and did not do so.

Here we encounter a peculiar feature of the Nazi State: the existence of overlapping and conflicting jurisdictions. The multiplication of authorities, none of which fit into a clear hierarchical authority, produced the characteristic chaos of the Third Reich, which has prompted historians to speak of a "polykratie" or rule by many. It is a paradox that Hitler's absolute power generated bureaucratic muddle. The chaos arose because the leadership principle, the so-called Führerprinzip, forced all decision-making up the various lines of authority and precluded compromises at lower levels. Unless Hitler or one of his great satraps made a specific decision, the bureaucratic battle could go on for years. This can be seen perfectly in the hesitation and indecisiveness of the Ministry of Propaganda.

Who was responsible for what? Where dancing did deteriorate and where dances that were not per se degenerate, were carried out in a questionable way, the police could intervene. These dances could be dealt with as single cases. Goebbels as minister did not wish to issue a specific prohibition of swing or similar dances. No further publications, either praising or condemning jazz, were to appear in the daily press. Necessary information would be printed in the specialist journals for music and dance. In other words: this was another confirmation of the status quo. The problem of jazz was to be kept as inconspicuous as possible and shunted to the regional levels for decision. As before, the professional associations were to instruct their members with regard to future conduct. The following text is OCRed from a book.

Fines should not be inflicted, as this directive was to be understood as a formally advisory one only. From time to time, the regional propaganda offices could officially declare dances as undesirable. Accordingly, regional and local offices could settle down with their own measures, which they could issue and which would be dictated by their local assessment of threats to law and order.*!

The debate surrounding jazz seemed to have been essentially settled but nevertheless it continued. There is something grotesque in the spectacle of mass murderers fussing about dancers swinging their arms or wiggling their bottoms. War criminals capable of exterminating millions had striven in vain to ban popular dances. The issue had been formally presented in all relevant decision-making authorities. It had been handed from institution to institution, from office to office, and nothing had really happened.

After the attack on Poland and the beginning of the Second World War, the question of swing and jazz dance should have become irrelevant. Once German troops invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, all public dance events were forbidden anyway. There were to be no more small or large "dance entertainments". Jazz, swing, or waltz—whether dangerous or seductive, morally safe or harmless—were not to be danced at all.

At first, dancing within dancing schools and learning dances in special courses were exempted. Regular teaching in dance schools was also allowed, as was dancing at private events. Fine distinctions, again, made a lot of difference.

Though the Nazi bureaucrats came back to jazz dance now and again, it had, on the whole, been replaced by a very different, more acute problem: Germany was at war. Still, the Ministry of Propaganda and the headquarters of the Wehrmacht had not forgotten completely about jazz and swing. They were considering an even more extensive prohibition of dance, music, and entertainment in general. Instead, the opposite happened.

At the end of October, after the victory over Poland, all dance prohibitions were lifted, "out of consideration for the population, which had been asked to bear many sacrifices. It should not have all joys of life taken from them." (In any case, and this sounded like echoes from peacetime, there had been sizeable unemployment among professional musicians and dance teachers who had not been drafted into the Wehrmacht. This was not desirable either.42)

The Ministry of Propaganda was soon to change course yet again. Dance, as entertainment and as art, was gradually eliminated. As early as 17 November 1939, Goebbels had forbidden carnival festivities during that very cold winter, including dance music and other "light" entertainment music.4? On 10 January 1940, he demanded the prevention of all scandalous and offensive activities in dance localities.44 On 20 February 1940, the Minister asked whether anyone had a new ban in mind and answered his own question by suggesting that no more bans were necessary. He personally did not wish further measures to be taken.

To ensure morale in the population was an immensely important task for the Ministry of Propaganda. Proper ideology, preached relentlessly and proclaimed constantly, was one thing; entertainment to make a gigantic war tolerable was another. It seemed logical to integrate dance into this system and to use dance in order to offer a bit of "joy in life". It was an undisruptive amusement, which distracted people from the dreariness and fear of everyday life in wartime. After the "Polish campaign," he had thought it a good idea to encourage dance. Then, in mid-1940, he changed his mind yet again and cracked down—no dance; but then followed another turn—more dance. The triumphant Wehrmacht promised to extend German authority to the entire continent. By 31 October 1940, Hitler's troops had conquered Denmark and Norway, The Netherlands, and Belgium. France was occupied and ruled by a puppet state. Goebbels now ordered a relaxation on the previous restrictions for the Greater German Radio Network, which was allowed to play yet more dance music, including international titles. But for safety's sake, he asked the Wehrmacht for permission. In December 1940, the Ministry of Propaganda was so sure of victory that even more prohibitions were loosened. Radio stations were advised to play more dance music. Some of the local propaganda offices went a step further: they asked Berlin to reverse the ban on dance because dancing had "positive effects" on the spirits of the population. The soldiers coming home from the occupied territories, in particular those from the General Government, insisted on diversion and amusement. They must have opportunities to forget the war, demanded the local propaganda offices. Taking these requirements into account, the Ministry allowed dancing in the Christmas season of 1940, once more under police supervision.

The discrepancy between the substance of ministerial decisions and what else was going on in the German Reich at war was colossal. The abyss between bureaucratic memoranda and mass killing in the occupied territories is one example. Outside ministerial offices, war and war atrocities, murder and holocaust worked havoc. But most people in the Reich closed their eyes and their ears; they did not want to know. They wanted to forget, they wanted to be entertained, not reminded of uncomfortable truths. Any form of amusement and distraction was welcome. At the end of the year of 1938, on November 10, while Germans were dancing to swing music, the synagogues burned. Most Germans shrugged and went on dancing. After all, what had dance to do with politics?

As we have seen, Joseph Goebbels and his colleagues in the Propaganda Ministry, Heinrich Himmler, his police and the SS, the High Command of the Armed Forces, Hitler and Reichsleiter Bormann really did see a connection between the right kind of entertainment and preparedness for war. They seriously believed that by loosening or tightening prohibitions—in this case on a certain kind of dance—they could manipulate daily behavior in the population. Now that belief was to be tested. On 1 February 1941, a complete prohibition on all performance of jazz music on German radio was—finally—issued. No music with "distorted" rhythms or atonal melody development was to be transmitted. No muted horns were to be heard. The prohibition was as unambiguous as any that Himmler had demanded in 1938. Goebbels confirmed in a decree dated 20 May 1941 that everything "that stemmed from Jews, had English texts, and no melody but only rhythm" had to be eradicated. Records with English or American labels could not be sold any more. On 31 May 1941, in an answer to enquiries from several local Propaganda Ministry offices, Goebbels refused to modify the dance prohibition, which meanwhile had been extended to social dancing. Roles were now reversed. The Propaganda Ministry in Berlin, pressed by its zealous local offices, had for years been reluctant to force a prohibition on the population. Now the local offices wanted a more relaxed interpretation or in some areas no ban at all. The more realistic local offices, dealing closely with unsatisfied people, wanted to lift the ban and thus raise morale. Soldiers on home leave hoped to be rewarded for their sacrifices. The Goebbels Ministry refused to budge, and received backing from the headquarters of the Wehrmacht. It is not easy to see why the Propaganda Ministry suddenly decided to sanction a complete dance prohibition. It was illogical for the Ministry of Propaganda to deprive itself of an efficient means of diversion and it contradicted its previous position that the “drug dance” was a harmless drug: it promised better times and dreams; it was a form of escape more necessary than ever for a population under stress. When, however, the office of the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces asked the Ministry to issue an even wider ban, covering dance circles for youth groups, dance lessons, and dance instructions, the Ministry of Propaganda hesitated once again, although this time for different reasons. It worried about the impact on a post-war world once German troops had been victorious. Dance could help Germany to consolidate its world status (Weltgeltung). In December 1941, such a consideration meant a lot to the Ministry. German postwar rule would want to show off its culture. Its disciplined youth had been made hard like Krupp steel by the war but had also acquired good manners in dance lessons. The special circumstances brought about by a world war made it impossible for German soldiers to spread the value of German social dance and its attendant good manners, but who knew when peace might allow the art of dance to flourish again?

186 Marion Kant

In reality, dance, as art or entertainment, more or less ceased to exist. By now the prohibition was directed against performing folk and community dances as well. Eventually war veterans were not allowed to dance either. Dance lessons in schools were also restricted. Of course, restrictions and prohibitions always needed to be reviewed and the bureaucrats were unlikely to miss an opportunity to talk about age limits, alcohol consumption, smoking, and other evils. It proved particularly difficult to agree on “the interpretation of the words ‘persons up to the age of 18’ according to § 3 police decree.” When official representatives of the Reich Ministry for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda (including: the Legal Office, Theater, and Propaganda), the Reich Security Head Office (SS), the Reich Ministry of Interior, The Head Office of the Police, the Party Chancellery, the local Reich Propaganda offices, the Reich Youth Office, the Cultural Senate in the Reich Youth Office, the National-Socialist Community “Strength through Joy,” the Reich Theater Chamber and the Reich Culture Chamber got together, they could not arrive at a consensus on certain items on the agenda. Should boys and girls go to dance lessons when they were fifteen or sixteen? Or should boys be sixteen and girls fifteen or younger or older? Or could girls be permitted to take lessons in waltzing at age fourteen? And by the way, what was the distinction between folk dances, social dances, and communal dances? Did anyone know? Future sessions would have to bring clarification. Over a dozen ministries, offices, and services of the Third Reich were engaged in a prolonged discussion of what seem absurd or trifling issues in the depth of a war of total annihilation. Yet this strange meeting with its strange discussions cannot simply be dismissed as laughable. They represented a deeply characteristic feature of the Nazi State: its rage for bureaucratic perfection. The Third Reich was a regime in which every activity, including waltz lessons, was to be uniformly carried out according to clearly defined categories and in harmony with the principles of the racial state. From the waltz to the gas chamber, everything had to follow the correct administrative procedures.

As the war dragged on, and discussions on whether or not to ban the remaining possibilities of dance became more and more ridiculous, one of the bureaucrats in the central Ministry of Propaganda eventually remarked laconically in February 1943: “First we need to be victorious!” (Erst siegen!)* But victory did not happen. The year 1943 passed without triumph and the year 1944 brought more defeats. Still, the discussions and arguments raged on, even though theaters and dance schools had closed, artists and teachers had been drafted, and there was nothing left to forbid. Memos were written and sent. There is something uncanny about this empty bureaucratic activity, but it was characteristic of Hitler’s reach that his civil servants went on passing paper to each other until all the ministries were buried in rubble. Who knows what went on in their heads?

What is clear, if scarcely credible, is that the Ministry of Propaganda, the local Reich Propaganda offices, and even the High Command of the Armed Forces (OKW) continued to occupy themselves with banning or re-enforcing a prohibition of dance until the end of the war. As late as 1945, they were still arguing about dance lessons, their moral implications, and whether there were to be general or special rules with exceptions. Order, National-Socialist order, required both uniformity and clarity, even in trifling matters like the prohibition of certain kinds of dance. The rule of Nazi hierarchy and subordination, the Führer or leadership principle, had to extend to the smallest dance hall. Ultimately, it is in these specific cases that one sees in what precise way the Nazi regime can be called “totalitarian.” The mechanisms of an entire system that tried to gain control over every possible area of life had taken on perplexing and monstrous dimensions. Bizarre, inhumane, useless, and at the same time destructive, empty, and crazy—Tanzverbot, “dance prohibition,” was an authentic reflection of German circumstances in a very special German time. Although in the end it was ideologically ineffective and politically nonsensical, this ban on dancing demonstrated one thing above all: no place, no matter, no issue was too trivial for National-Socialist arbitrary tyranny to ignore.

The Mayor of the City of Essen

to: Herr Minister of State Dr Leers,

194 Marion Kant
Dear Herr Minister of State,

Permit me to introduce to you the director of the “Folkwang Dance Theater of the City of Essen,” Herr Kurt Jooss. Herr Jooss is the creator of the dance The Green Table, which has recently been awarded a prize in Paris and has been performed in Germany, in Switzerland, as well as in Holland, France, and England with great success. I belong to the greatest admirers of this remarkable achievement.

Herr Jooss has been, together with his group, engaged by the Essen City Theater. He has now indicated that he wishes to step down in order to accept several extremely prestigious engagements abroad in Western Europe and North America. He has the understandable desire to organize guest appearances in Germany, especially in Essen, where his group has grown up with him. He has in the meantime choreographed several new works.

A certain difficulty has arisen in the fulfillment of this understandable intention, which is much to be welcomed. The difficulty lies in the fact that the composer of the music for The Green Table and also of the music for the newly created works is Herr Fritz Alexander Cohen. The said gentleman comes from the well-known University Bookstore in Bonn but had to be suspended during the revolution because of his non-Aryan origins. The taint in his genealogy arises from his paternal grandfather, who on the other hand must have been baptized already. It could also have been the case, as Herr Jooss will explain to you, that the said grandfather had been born a Christian. In any case, Herr Cohen is marked as a Jew, and in the present set of circumstances in Essen, and perhaps in other places, difficulties may arise if Herr Cohen appears on the playbill as composer and takes part in the performance. (The music is written for two pianos).

Since the Joossian art is the fruit of the purest German philosophy and German sensibility, I should personally very much regret it if Jooss and his dance group should be condemned to perform abroad only because of a hostile attitude on account of the said Cohen. In agreement with Herr Oberbürgermeister Dr. Reismann-Grone, I have advised Herr Jooss to seek the view of the Theater Committee or at least its chairman, Herr Hinkel, in order to avoid difficulties in eventual performances in Germany. I have urged Herr Jooss to discuss with you this case, which is truly important for the development of German modern dance and to seek your support. I should be grateful if you were willing to assist Herr Jooss.

With my highest respects,
Your devoted

Document 3 (PRIVATE COLLECTION)
Dresden, 11 July 1933
To the graduates of the Wigman School, Dresden, the Palucca School, Dresden, and the Triimpy School, Berlin

As a result of thorough discussions, we have now resolved the question of the subordination of educational institutions into the newly formed professional organizations of the Reich. In the general interest and in order to maintain contact with the representatives of our working methods in dance, we feel an obligation to orientate you about our decisions in this question. With this orientation we combine at the same time the call to you to join the organization in the manner that will emerge from the following exposition and for your part to make a contribution so that our work will find fruitful realization in the formation of the new people's community (Volksgemeinschaft).

We have decided to join the National-Socialist Teachers' Federation as well as the Fighting League for German Culture. As our representative, empowered and entitled to negotiate for us with the Reich administration, will be the section of the National-Socialist Teachers' Federation called the Reich Association of German Turn, Sport, and Gymnastics Teachers, Berlin. Within this Reich Association, the newly formed Professional Association (Fachverband) for Gymnastic and Dance as a recognized Reich organization represents the special interests of gymnastic and dance teachers. This professional association as supreme organization will include 1. the German Body Education Association (D.K.V.) 2. the German Gymnastic League 3. the Bode Professional Association. Their representatives are the chairmen of the three named subgroups, Herr Jo Fischer-Klamt, Herr Oberschulrat Hilker, and Herr Dr. Bode. An extension of the professional association beyond the three already existing associations has been rejected on organizational grounds both in terms of administrative unity and coherence.

As a result, the subgroup that comes into question for us is the German Body Education Association, Headquarters Berlin, which the Wigman School, Dresden, as central institute, the Palucca School, Dresden, the Triimpy School, Berlin, as well as for the time being the Wigman Schools in Hamburg and Chemnitz known as the Wigman School Group (a closed group of schools) have joined, effective 16 July 1933.

The special conditions covering our membership were laid out in a letter of membership which the Dresden Wigman School as central institute, the Dresden Palucca School and the Triimpy School have sent today to the chairman of the German Body Education Association from which we communicate certain passages to you as follows:

1. The Wigman School Group collectively joins the German Body Education Association. It consists of the coworkers of the Dresden Wigman School as central institute, the Dresden Palucca School, the Berlin Triimpy School as well as coworkers in the branches of these institutions within the territory of the German Reich. The individual presentation of the members will be carried out by the Wigman School as central institute. The latter will make every effort within the circles of the graduate teachers of the Wigman School, the Palucca School, and the Triimpy School to enroll them via the Wigman School Group in the D.K.V. (Deutscher Körperbildungsverband; German Body Education Association.) With respect to the branch institutions of the three schools, membership in the D.K.V. and thus in the N.S.L.B. (Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund; National-Socialist Teachers Union), the Fighting Force for German Culture and Professional Association (Fachschaft) for Gymnastic and Dance will be obligatory. Personal and professional prerequisites for fitness for such membership (the Aryan paragraph) will be strictly enforced.
2. The Wigman School Group will have permanent representation in the executive committee of the D.K.V. The following text is OCRed from a book. Please clean it up, removing extraneous characters and separating wrongly appended words. Whenever you encounter a number, verify if it is part of a header or footer, showing a page number. These must be removed. Important: do not continue unfinished sentences. Reply ONLY with the corrected text:

K.V. and Mrs. Mary Wigman have declared themselves ready to serve as permanent representatives on the condition that in case they cannot be present, they will entrust a delegate to act with full executive power in their name.

3. Communications will be gathered in the Wigman School after registration and forwarded to the D.K.V. Business communications between the members of the Wigman School Group and the D.K.V. (subscription to the magazine, payment of membership dues) will take place through the offices of the D.K.V. in direct contact with the members of the Wigman School Group. Members will receive from the D.K.V. their membership cards in the Fighting League for German Culture and the Professional Association for Gymnastic and Dance. With respect to professional matters (artistic-organizational, pedagogical-organizational) the Dresden Wigman School undertakes, in agreement with the executive committee of the D.K.V., to regulate such matters within the circle of members.

4. Members of the Wigman School Group will be expected to help to call into life local working groups and to take active part in them, which reflects the unified approach embodied in the foundation of the Professional Association for Gymnastic and Dance. Conditional upon the agreement of the executive committee of the D.K.V., the Wigman School Group will extend its recruitment to teachers and institutes of other styles of work, which operate in neighboring areas.

5. The annual subscription of a member of the Wigman School Group to the D.K.V. will be 16 RM including the subscription to the N.S.L.B., the Fighting League for German Culture and the Professional Association for Gymnastic and Dance. The amount within the 16 RM designated for membership in the D.K.V. can be reduced to the sum of 10 RM taking into account the fact that the Wigman School Group has more than forty members. We ask you to reply as soon as possible to the question as to whether you are prepared to join the Wigman School within the D.K.V. In case of a favorable answer, Documentary Appendix 197 membership forms, by-laws, as well as instructions for participation in the local working groups of the Professional Association for Gymnastic and Dance will be sent to you as speedily as possible. With best wishes

Document 4 (BUNDESARCHIV 50.01 237)
Fritz Bohme to: Reichsminister for Propaganda and Popular Enlightenment (sic), Dr Goebbels
8 November 1933

Newspapers in recent days have brought the news of the foundation of the Reich Culture Chamber connected to your Ministry and the seven special chambers included within it: visual arts, music, theater, literature, press, radio and film. One has to note the absence of a particular art: the art of movement. As far as I know, dance has up to now found no place for its concerns within your Ministry. The reasons for that are unknown to me. Dance is however worth special consideration, respect and attention, because it is not the lightly considered arabesque of a civilization or culture, as it is normally regarded. It is not a matter of indifference, whether in a small cabaret caricatures of stupefied and idiotic peasants are danced or in social dancing forms alien to our nature or foreign rhythmic movements are practiced as matter of course every day. Nor can it be irrelevant that in theaters a ballet style, which emerges from a liberalistic conception of art, is cultivated, an international formalism, empty of popular content, appears every evening as an image of movement to the crowd, although the new German artistic dance has already won full recognition abroad. It is equally impossible to try to build artistic dance on gymnastics, which serves entirely different purposes. The German artistic dance, especially in its stage variant, which has now gone through its own development, must not be allowed to be neglected as an art form in its own right. It will not suffice to mix it up with gymnastic, sporting, or pedagogical pursuits. If we are to arrive again at healthy, or more precisely to arrive for the first time, at German expressiveness, then a unified leadership is necessary, which can only come from a single personality who knows the virtues and vices of all the partial areas and builds on the basis of a fundamental position guided by racism and an awareness of the essence, function, and cultural mission of dance. So considered, dance can function, directed to its goal, as a constructive and formative force, as the guardian of racial values, and as a shield against the flood of 198 Marion Kant confusing foreign postures alien to the German character and German stance, and could be made effective, and uncertainty of instinct and weaknesses, which, received through body movement, can affect the will and lame it.

The dance element is not to be underestimated as a factor in cultural life. One can suppress it but it will find a way to burst out as explosive opposition (epidemics of dance in the middle ages). One can neglect it as a matter of state policy. It will then grow wild and proliferate (the postwar period!). One can grasp it positively. It will then be a fresh source of good cheer, harmony, and inner equilibrium. There are two categories of dance: |. self-danced forms (folk dancing and social dancing), and 2. performed dance (theater, podium, variety, cabaret). Both are bearers of consequences and influence, first of all, by accustoming people either to genuine or false, native or alien, healthy or unhealthy postures and movements, but secondly the formation of an inner model (that is, influence on attitudes). Our attitude is both an inner and an outer affair, and can be decisive, creative or destructive. The effect must be of such a nature, that is, only such forms must be projected that the German as a person is rebuilt and renewed, led back to himself and educated.

Dance is a race question. There is no international dance form that is above race. Where dance is so cultivated, it attacks the roots and the authentic expression of a people (Volk). It is no coincidence that the dance movement of our racial antipodes, which is seriously meant that of Negroes and Jews, seems to the healthy among us as repellent, grotesque-comic. By constant exposure to the spectacle, combined with the sycophancy of our press, the instinct for our specifically natural elements can be dulled. (Dance criticism rested largely in Jewish hands and in part still does even today). That is also how we accustom ourselves to alien forms and rhythms in self-danced activities. There must be an office from which such matters can be authoritatively, conscientiously, and uniformly handled. This is not a question of formalism or aesthetics but of the cultivation of the authenticity of German forms of expression in the shaping of body stance, which radiates either a constructive or a destructive force into life. It must be of urgent importance that an office be created where these issues in their entirety can be grasped attentively as normative and propagandistic matters, from a racial and National-Socialist standpoint, therefore, from the point of view of the renewal of Germany. Perhaps it might be possible to create an eighth chamber in the Reich Culture Chamber for Movement Art and Dance. I ask for your permission, Honored Minister, to be granted an opportunity to support these remarks in a personal audience with you. Heil Hitler!

In the appendix, I send you a memorandum about artistic dance in Germany, together with a set of administrative-technical and financial proposals. On the occasion of a report by the undersigned on 12 July 1934, at which Herr Ministerial Director Greiner and Herr Ministerial Councilor Dr. Ott were present, State Secretary Funk approved these proposals. I pass the memorandum on to you for your information and for the files at your end, and draw your attention to that fact after the most exact assessment of the necessary expenditure the sum originally proposed of 90,000 RM for the Reich Dance Week has been reduced to 60,000 RM. A further reduction is not possible nor is a reduction in the sum of 12,000 RM set aside for dance schools in financial difficulty. Payments will be made from the fund for the promotion of artistic purposes - Chap. V a 2, Title 6 - to which the ten percent of the fund not yet expended after its authorization by the RFM [Reich Finance Ministry - JS] will be put as well as any eventual surpluses or deficits from planned dance event.

Appendix to Document 5 RMfPopaProp (Reich Ministry for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda) Note Berlin, 9 January 1934

Since about 1900, there has existed a modern form of artistic dance in Germany, which has grown out of German preconditions (founder: Laban), which as German art dance has conquered all European and extra-European culturally advanced states (e.g., America and Japan). In this dance, the German man creates works of dance (individual, group, and choral activities) in a way that Nietzsche desired for "the moving and dancing German man." He uses the medium of his body trained to be 200 Marion Kant his instrument and draws such works from the depths of German emotional and spiritual life, which can stand side-by-side with most of the worthiest works of art in other artistic areas and in the shaping of the festive and ceremonial in the life rhythms of the Third Reich, which have an especially comprehensive role to play. This Ausdruckstanz (in the world known as the "New German Dance" or "la nouvelle dance allemande") is just at this moment being rejected unjustly not by the public but by some members of the clique of theater dance enthusiasts (ballet). They prevent it and try to suppress it idiotically with slogans such as "cubism" or "expressionism." In the "German League of Choir Singers and Association of Dancers," the compulsory professional association also for art dancers within the Reich Theater Chamber, a choir singer has the lead who understands nothing at all about art dance. A subgroup within the National-Socialist Teachers' Federation is also trying at present to pursue a special interest policy within this area of art and at the cost of this particular art form, although the Teachers' Federation has absolutely no jurisdiction in this area. Finally, during the auditions of dancers for the theater, all German art dancers were systematically rejected and only those who had been trained in ballet, often at foreign ballet schools, were accepted. This is all the sillier as slowly but surely the dance creations of German art dance are beginning to overcome the all too styl- ized and soulless figures of ballet dancing in the great and culturally important dance groups in theaters. What is clear is that German art dance stands on the edge of col- lapse. The economically weak but artistically recognized independent artists receive no help from official sources, and as result of the opposition mentioned and as a result of the economic situation in Germany face ruin. Important representatives of German art dance are either jobless or forced to earn their bread abroad. The four model schools of German art dance (Wigman, Palucca, Laban, Giinther) are desolate and face collapse. German art dance, which has advertised German culture in triumphal march abroad (e.g., America and Japan) and could make German cultural propa- ganda a la Fiirtwangler with corresponding support, is about to die, unless the Pro- paganda Ministry intervenes at the last minute.

What is to be done?

1. Measures that cost no money:
	* An official commitment to the importance of and necessity for German art dance. Without an official prompting, the anxious and uncertain spirits will not be soothed.
	* Influence the specialist press and critics so that they no longer make propa- ganda only for gymnastics, ballet, and foreign ballet schools both at home and abroad (handwritten: “Dr. Grohmann, Bohme, Strength through Joy critics”)
	* Instructions to the Professional Association, to theater intendants, and to city administrations to place more weight on German art dance and its cultivation and to open theater and meeting places in greater measure to presentations of Ger- man art dance. Documentary Appendix 201
	* Instructions to Opera intendants to include in their ballet ensembles an appropriate percentage of German art dancers, especially, since for other vital rea- sons, the penetration of ballet dance by works of French and Italian origin must be countered by typically German artistic creativity.
	* Establishment of the training course for the coming generation of dancers and the setting-up of suitable examination committees.
2. Measures that will cost money temporarily:
	* Temporary subsidies for the four essential leading dance schools, which without help will close their doors in September. This subsidy must last until 1 Jan- uary 1935 and will cost 10 to 12,000 RM.
	* Make provision for the great tasks of German art dance. From the 6th to the Oth of September this year the three German choreographers Laban, Wigman, Giin- ther were supposed to demonstrate their abilities in Venice at the invitation of the Ital- ian government. A month ago the Italian government postponed the event to 1936 because of lack of money. This is an occasion for the Propaganda Ministry to inter- vene and to grant to this wonderful area of art, which has hitherto been treated in Germany like an unwanted child, the possibility to develop its potential on German soil and to show what it can do.
	* Execution of the measures under paragraph 2 would lead inevitably to the foundation of a permanent dance theater in Berlin, which would make propaganda for Germany’s cultural mission and development in Germany, in tours abroad, and above all at the Olympic Games in 1936. I shall submit appropriate proposals in due course. (signed) Keudell

13 July. [Appendix to II, para.2:] From 9 to 16 December a German art dance week (the name can be changed) is to take place in the Volksbiihne (Theater on Horst-Wessel-Platz). The three choreographers who had been invited to perform in Venice, Laban, Wigman, Giinther, will be directed to create one work for group dance each and to employ for this purpose three separate groups of ten to fifteen unemployed dancers for performance in December. With these events, which will be directed to the communal dance (group dance), there should be interspersed offerings, which show the art of individual dance. The 202 Marion Kant personalities who come into consideration in the first place are Palucca, Harald Kreutzberg, perhaps, Alice Uhlen and Herr von Swaine. So, Sunday 9 December, matinee (three group dance works) Tuesday | 1 December, evening performance for individual dance creations Thursday 13 December, group dance works Saturday 15 December, individual creations ve RYN > Sunday 16 December, a matinee with group dance works. Cost calculations: —21,000 RM living support for ca. forty dancers for three and a half months, as long as the rehearsals are required; per dancer per month 150 RM. — 4,000 RM for three orchestral compositions at 1,330 RM each. — 3,150 RM for an accompanist for rehearsals, who receives 300 RM per evening, thus per group 1,400 RM. — 4,000 RM for costumes and outfits, of which each costume costs ca. 100 RM per dancer x forty dancers. — 15,000 RM for choreographic direction for each choreographer who must a) each create a work; b) will have to dedicate three and a half months to a substantial choreo- graphical job and will therefore be unable to take on guest performances or other forms of income-earning activity. — 3,150 RM for one assistant director/choreographer per production, who will receive 300 RM per month, thus three x 1,400 RM. — 3,000 RM for travel expenses. —4,000 RM for soloist fees for ca. four soloists on two evenings. In the fee music, cos- tumes, travel, and lodging are included . — 2,560 RM for board and lodging during the dance week in Berlin: eight days x forty dancers at 10 RM per day. Total 59,860 RM Income: 1. 3,000 RM on each of five Berlin evening performances equals 15,000 RM. 2. It is intended that the dances performed during the Dance Festival Week will be performed in all the major German cities and perhaps abroad as well. Since no additional organization costs will arise and there will only be the costs of touring and lodging there is the fairly certain prospect of income, which will substantially reduce the previously estimated cost entry even within the budget year 1934 itself. It is therefore requested that the sum of 59,860 RM plus the additional sum of 12,000 RM (support for the four exemplary schools) be debited for the fund for the Promotion of Art Dance - Ch.

Examination Regulations for German Dancers and for Teachers of German Dance
ref: Reich Theater Chamber filed: signed K (eudell) 10/X Aw
GENERAL PROVISIONS
I. The Examination for German Dancers is the precondition for acceptance in the relevant professional association of the Reich Theater Chamber and entitles the said dancer to exercise the profession of dancer in all public and private theaters, stages, concert halls, and other places of performance, which fall under paragraph 33 of the Reich Trade Regulations. Artistic dance performances may be rehearsed and artistically directed in professional terms only by members of the said professional association. Equally amateur performances in which professionals take part fall under the same regulations. Traveling companies require in addition a special artistic license to be provided by the professional association.
II. The Examination for German Dancers does not qualify the holder to teach. An additional teacher’s competence certificate is necessary for that purpose. This may either precede or can later follow the passing of the dance examination. Only with the successful completion of the examination can a dancer be formally enrolled in the section “Dance Teaching Personnel” of the said Professional Association.
III. Instruction in dance of any kind may be given only by dance teaching personnel of the said Professional Association. This provision refers to teachers of dance and music-rhythmic body education, to teachers of amateur and art dance, for ballet, acrobatics, etc. Schools that only provide partial instruction in the teaching areas described below are to be regarded as special schools and have not got the right to prepare students for the examination for German dancers.
Documentary Appendix 205
VI. Independent training of dancers in one’s own school may only be undertaken by teachers of German Art Dance after three years of practice but not before the attainment of twenty-four years and only after the satisfactory completion of “the Examination for German Dancers. "Until such time, said persons may only give amateur instruction, act as chorus leaders, work as assistants at recognized schools, and in appropriate circumstances be active as stage dancers. The authorization to train dancers and dance teaching personnel will be issued from time to time by application to the Reich Theater Chamber. V. Teaching personnel who confine themselves exclusively to instruction of amateurs only require the “Examination for teachers of German Dance.” After completion of that examination, such persons may freely instruct lay pupils in dance or music-rhythmic body education, in folk dancing, in round games, in movement choruses, etc. with the proviso, however, that students of such instructors may not be admitted to the “Examination for German Dancers.” VI. Whoever wishes to give instruction in gymnastics in addition to dance will be expected to produce a corresponding, recognized certificate of teaching competence in such a field. VII. Teachers, whose main professional activity is gymnastics, body education, sports gymnastics, or other gymnastic activities [Turnen in original —JS] do not belong to the Professional Association in the RThCh.

B. PROVISIONS REGARDING ELIGIBILITY FOR THE EXAMINATION AND THE TRAINING COURSE

A. In general, students will be admitted to the examination who can demonstrate a three-year training course.

B. The basic prerequisites of such a course are:

1. Entry age: sixteen years of age. Children's instruction in theater schools will not be affected by such provisions.
2. Conditions for acceptance: medical health and bodily fitness certificate. Aryan origins. For students who wish to undertake the teacher's competence examination in principle, secondary school education.
3. Length of training course: three years comprising at least nine months of instruction and at least twenty-four hours a week. Dance students who, at entry, can already demonstrate a dance training or dance practice in children's companies in theaters or who prove themselves to be especially gifted may abbreviate the three-year course in recognition of their previously acquired 206 Marion Kant skills. Pupils who attend the school only to acquire the certificate of competence for teachers for dance body education or amateur dance only require two years but must have attained their seventeenth year before admission.
4. Character of the training: the training course may prepare candidates for the Examination for German Dancers or for The Examination for Teachers of German Dance. The training course divides into lower and upper stages. The lower stage runs for at least one scholastic year and serves as preparation and as time for acquisition of the fundamentals of body education in a natural way in the sense understood by German art dance. The upper stage is comprised of at least two years and provides the dance instruction as such: for German art dance and the classical, historic form of dance. Musical and theoretical instruction is to be distributed appropriately over the two stages. Insofar as teacher training with a view to acquisition of the teacher's certificate of competence is attempted simultaneously with dance training, appropriate pedagogical instruction will be given room. For pupils who attend the school only to obtain the teacher's certificate of competence for dance body education and amateur dance, the two-year course required will be divided into an upper and lower stage accordingly of one year in each case. 5. Axiom of the training course: to develop dance abilities to full potential and not merely to teach technical ability.
6. Object of the training course: to produce dancers who serve German Art Dance not merely through their dancing abilities but also by means of their artistic will, which puts them in position to be culture bearers of the German dance idea, be it as German dancers or as teachers of German Art Dance. Dancers, who obtain the teacher’s certificate of competence should be competent not only to prepare professional dancers but also to give instruction in dance body education and amateur dance. They must be equal to the great German task of body education for children, young people and adults both in their specific areas and in general pedagogic terms in order to be able to cooperate in aesthetic development, social fulfillment, and employment of free time. Training must give them the tools to do this.

Reich Theater Chamber, Executive Office to Herr Ministerial Councilor von Keudell
Reich Ministry for Propaganda and Popular Enlightenment
Berlin, 11 October 1934 (Stamp: "on | June 1935 matter settled")

Dear Herr von Keudell,

With regard to the examination regulations for German dancers and with reference to our telephone conversation of today's date, I submit herewith a copy of the minute, which I wrote together with a copy of the list of those present for your kind consideration and further implementation. Heil Hitler! (signed) Fraunfeld (stamp)

Minute of the meeting on 10 October this year in the Reich Theater Chamber:

Dear Herr von Keudell,

The meeting was opened at around 11.00 o'clock in the morning by the president of the Reich Theater Chamber, Ministerial Councilor Otto Laubinger, who immediately gave the floor to Ministerial Councilor von Keudell for his report on the draft of an examination scheme for German dancers and teachers of German Artistic Dance. The draft had been circulated to members of the relevant professional associations before the meeting, so that those present had been thoroughly oriented about the details of the draft.

In the discussion that followed, in which the representatives of the German Stage Association and the German League of Choir Singers and Association of Dancers took a prominent part, the issues of the age of admittance, the length of the training, and occupation during the training period played a particular role. Herr Ober-regierungsrat Director Scheffels, and Ballet Master Terpis spoke especially sharply against the admission age of sixteen. Equally disputed was the question of whether the course should last two or three years. Ballet Master Terpis, in contrast to Ballet Mistress Frau Maudrick, argued that a two-year course was entirely adequate if followed by a year of practical work. Minister (ret.) Dr. Leers also thought that an admission age of sixteen was too high and suggested that it be left to the directors of the recognized theater schools, whether and in which form to shorten the course of the training period. President Laubinger spoke in favor of the start of the training period at the completion of the fifteenth year and further for the possibility that the students should be actively engaged in the theater during the last year of the training, so that the practical year and beginning years could be reduced. With regard to the transitional regulations for the examination scheme for German dancers, Ministerial Councilor Laubinger suggested some amendments he had formulated, which are attached as an appendix. There followed a discussion of whether the next examinations should be carried out through the Reich committee provided for in the draft or by the existing examination boards. The chairman established that there was agreement that in 1935, under all circumstances, there had to be examinations, but that it would be left open whether the examinations should be carried out by the new Reich committee or the existing agencies. In any case, it would be 1936 before the new examination contents, as they had been stipulated in the paragraphs C, I to VIII, could be required of the examiners and candidates. For 1935, a special instruction would be issued for the examining boards.

Dear Sirs,

My children Inge and Uschi are not Aryan. Their father Walter Kiehl is pure Aryan and a war veteran, at present a typographer. I am separated from him. The children were supposed to take part in ballet lessons at the local City Theater in the private ballet class of the ballet mistress and the first solo dancer. Ballet lessons are private and do not involve public performance on the stage, but the instruction takes place in the ballet hall of the city theater. The General Intendant [of the theater -JS] has forbidden the children to take part in the ballet class, although as far as I know there is a paragraph that says that non-Aryan children, if especially gifted and where one parent is Aryan, may be admitted to instruction, which I can understand is intended to avoid any possible embarrassment. Since, however, the law exists and the children are Protestant, I request ministerial permission to allow the children to take part in the lessons, all the more since the instruction does not involve any performance on stage. The children are well educated and besides the elder who is nine is class spokesman in the V.D.A. (Office of Germans in foreign countries) and really kills herself for it and yet the participation in instruction at the City Theater is refused her. I ought also to note that my father fought in the 1914 to 18 war and my grandfather took part in the campaign against the French in 1870. I hope that I have not made a mistaken appeal. With German greetings

Nothing can in my view be done with respect to the prohibition of the Breslau General Intendant, because such prohibition corresponds absolutely to the prevailing views. It is also in my view entirely questionable whether it is appropriate in view of the wartime activities of the grandfather and great-grandfather of the children to apply the exceptional provisions of the civil service purification legislation to establish the existence of exceptional circumstances in a case such as this. I am inclined to take a negative view. Heil Hitler! By Order, (signed) illegible 216 Marion Kant

Those Germans who have read the declaration of the Reich Directorium of the National-Socialist Cultural Commune in the affair of Furtwangler versus Hindemith, are absolutely amazed at the public declaration that National-Socialist agencies are supporting a woman like Mary Wigman, whose attitude is only too well known. Does anybody seriously believe that Mary Wigman’s position today is anything more than opportunism? Can one consider a woman truly German, who only two years ago changed her name by deed poll from the good German Marie Wiegmann into the English form Mary Wigman? Besides it is very well known that the teaching personnel, including musicians and secretaries, in the Wigman School in Dresden and in Chemnitz is made up exclusively of communist-Bolsheviks and that the Jews plays the main role in the school. An Eastern Jewess dared to say to a young girl pupil who wore a Swastika badge, “don’t let that be seen in this school or you will be kicked out.” Since this Eastern Jewess was one of the darlings of the school, this indicates that she was extremely likely to be well informed about what girls with National-Socialist credentials will encounter.

Documentary Appendix 217

Other artists are unpleasantly aware of the fact that Wigman seems to have suc- ceeded in getting advantages for herself in the most influential places, when they, if not public supporters of National Socialism, were at least not overtly hostile to it. One should be a bit more cautious in issuing newspaper declarations against the one when another is apparently publicly protecting some other equally guilty of opportunism. 1935

Deutsche Tanzbiihne
To Reich Ministry for Pop.Enl. and Prop.
Attention: Herr von Keudell
11 February 1935
Ref: in reply to your letter of 29 January 1935, herewith my interpretation of the con- cept “German Dance”
Heil Hitler! (signed) Laban
Deutsche Tanzbiihne
The interpretation of the concept “German Dance”: The categorization of a dance form as “German dance” can be justified from many points of view. In the first place, there are those dances which have been danced in various German regions in traditional forms, which we can certainly call German dances. Here, there are mutually borrowed elements from the dances of neighboring peoples. A whole array of folk dance steps are cultivated in the same ways in Holland, England, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Switzerland, and Northern Italy as well as in Germany (Polka, Mazurka, many counter dances). It cannot be established if one or the other of these peoples first developed the relevant dance steps and dance forms, but they have penetrated so deeply into the flesh and blood of the German people that they can confidently be termed German dances. The waltz is certainly a German dance. Indeed, it can be called the typical form of dance movement of the German Volk.

This brings me to the second point of view, from which the concept "German Dance" is to be assessed. Here, we deal with the type of movement and the form of movement that correspond to and arise from essential German features. Here, it can only be briefly remarked that racial characteristics stamp themselves in the movements, especially in the rhythm, in the posture of the body, and in the use of the body parts.

Marion Kant Reflection on that which is not German in dance will most quickly lead to clarification. Certain Spanish or Hungarian or indeed certain definitely Slavic bodily movements and rhythms are so foreign to the essence of German expressive and cultural sensibilities that they could never be taken over and molded into German forms of dance. This applies to exotic forms of movement of more distant races such as Negroes, Indians, Mongols, etc. To be sure, there are sometimes occasions when something native will be adapted from a foreign stimulus, which we can observe both in the Middle Ages and in modern times. For example, at the time of the Crusades, both peasant and aristocratic forms of our own racial dances evolved from the Moriscos (Moor's dances) and more recently the so-called German tango grew out of Iberian dance rhythms and Anglo-German social dances from Negroid running and hopping dances. How far such transformations, often third hand, of dance structures can be considered German dance types depends doubtless on the way they are performed and used.

There is a third point of view. One can assess dances according to their social and societal use as either foreign or home grown. There are courtly dances, which are historically undoubtedly of foreign origin, such as the minuet. Although they reflect a foreign choreographic origin, and in spite of the fact that they reflect entirely courtly customs, they have in certain transformations had an impact on peasant dancing. Thus, today social dances have by their very wide use become themselves folk dances. It is even questionable today and for the foreseeable future, if the distinction between folk dance and social dance is really tenable and where the boundaries are to be drawn. In conclusion, it can be said that today waltzes and running dances from the area of so-called social dancing can be certainly accepted as German dances, insofar as they are performed in the German way and to music that corresponds to the sensibilities of the German Volk. An interpretation of the concept "German Art Dance," that is, the various representational forms of dance, must be approached in much the same way from similar points of view.

(handwritten note of Ministerial councilor von Keudell: “It is probably still premature to provide a fixed definition. What can be said is that “today waltzes and running dances from the area of so-called social dancing can be certainly accepted as German dances, insofar as they are performed in the German way and to music that corresponds to the sensibilities of the German Volk.”) Documentary Appendix 219 Document 15 (BUNDESARCHIV 50.01 237) President, Reich Theater Chamber To The Reich Minister for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda, Section IX 27 February 1935 With respect to the matter concerning the scheduling and organization of the free dancers, I pass on a memorandum sent to me by my professional association, the German League of Choir Singers and Association of Dancers for your attention. I draw your attention in particular to the necessity, emphasized by my professional association, of granting subsidies and support from the Reich. I should like further to bring to your attention that the Reich Association of German Callisthenics [Turnen —JS], Sport and Gymnastics continues to claim for itself those artistic dance pedagogues who give instruction in rhythmic gymnastics. pp. (signed) Frauenfeld German League of Choir Singers and Association of Dancers Memorandum About the artistic and organization classification of the free German dance community on the basis of the regulations for application of the Reich Culture Chamber Law and the First Implementation Ordinance, as well as Order No. 20 of the Herr President of the Reich Theater Chamber: The general interest shown on all sides for German dance, which the Festival of German Dance of 1934 has proven, shows that the times are ripe for this art form. There is an obligation accordingly in a similar way on the part of the German free dance community and the agencies that regulate it not to let things stop here. The German free dance community appreciates the role of the Reich Culture Chamber as protector of the arts in the new Germany. Success has shown that this must be just a starter so as to build up the entire area of the free German dance community in such a way that it becomes a valuable independent art-form and cultural factor and is so conceived. Only a unified overall leadership and organization of all free German dancers gives the guaranty that the art of dance has a strong foundation on which to let its ideas blossom unhindered to their full creative potential. In this central organizational process the following points must be remembered: I. The organization of the profession II. The next measures III. The structure of training and examining IV. The final clarification of the association membership on the basis of the regulations for application of the Reich Culture Chamber Law and the First Implementation Ordinance, as well as Order No. 20 of the Herr President of the Reich Theater Chamber. I. The Organization of the Profession The organization of the profession [Stand in the original — JS] for free German dancers is to recognize all the working areas of the dancer. The organization of the profession must serve to protect the Free German Dance Corps [“Tanzerschaft” in the original - JS], which is the only authorized body competent to solve dance problems. a) All practitioners of the dance, choral dance directors, and dance teachers belong to the Free German Dance Corps. The representative organization of the Free German Dance Corps is the German League of Choir Singers and Association of Dancers, the professional association of the Reich Theater Chamber in the Reich Culture Chamber. An employment and control agency must be established to support, promote, and help the Free German Dance Corps in all its activities. The agency must have a permanent travel manager to cover the entire Reich. Within the Free German Dance Corps, a group council shall be set up, composed of four members, with a group chairman responsible for artistic oversight. The group chairman, proposed by the president, needs confirmation from the Reich Theater Chamber.

b) Analogous wage conditions for theater dancers must be set up for the Free German Dance Corps as a basis for honoraria and fees, etc.
c) The employment agency of the professional association must establish a card file, which includes all free German dancers. It must stay in contact with all cultural agencies and organizations.
d) This agency must ensure that the dancer material is and remains of high quality. All free German dancers who remain unemployed for any substantial length of time, must undergo an examination according to the provisions of the Reich Theater Chamber.
e) A unified teaching and examination scheme, which is to be worked out in cooperation with leading dance pedagogues and revised by the relevant offices, is to be established by law as the foundation of dance training and certification.
f) An inspection of schools to ensure that this uniform foundation program is being carried out is to be introduced, naturally, with due consideration for the workshop character of each school.
g) The establishment of an independent dance theater and an elite troop under its own artistic and financial direction to travel through all of Germany is to be realized. This dance theater is undoubtedly the dream of every artistic dancer. The German Dance Festivals have shown that this is possible. The first attempt was a great success. Now it is time to consolidate and build it up. It would then be conceivable to imagine a dance theater as an entirely independent institute, which would perform for the whole year. Within the framework of the German Dance Festival, it was only possible to show a part of the rich variety of German dance. It was only a cross-section, and many individual and group talents could not be involved. It might even be thinkable to combine all the best forces in one unified group to be agreed by a commission, which would give joint performances, broken down into separate numbers, in order to prove that this group is ideally called upon to travel through Germany. It goes without saying that in the first instance, only the most selective material will appear in such dance evenings. One could even envisage, although this lies in a more distant future, the foundation of corresponding dance theaters in all the major cities. Every school and every pupil could be afforded the possibility of showing his progressively growing expertise in studio performance within the framework of this theater.

II. Concerning the next steps
Finding work is by far the most important problem in the construction of the organization. The financial foundation for the establishment and improvement of the employment agency for all free German dancers must be created and secured by a loan from the Reich, the Propaganda Ministry, or some other agency, irrevocable and interest-free, for at least five years and repayable in installments. It might be worth considering employment opportunities for free German dancers such as work in podium dancing, film activity, folkish meetings [“Thing” meetings - JS], outdoor shows. Beyond the realm of artistic dance in all its aspects, we have to work on the Volk and its choric lay dance forms, which express the aesthetic and educational values for the new Man on whose development National-Socialist Germany is now working, and from which the formative elements in the creation of the new human being must be seized. It is, therefore, necessary for the unfolding and the cultural and cultic aspects of the new Germany to encourage the establishment of popular choric dances to be supervised by professional dance teachers. This dance form will be equally useful in its practice stage for those who dance in the choir, as in its usage form to enliven and increase enjoyment at ceremonies and festivals for those participating and those working with the dance choirs, and finally in its show stage in the framework of grand ceremonies at folkish meetings, open air theater, and mass festivals and the newly emerging cult and show-places.

III. Concerning the teaching and examination regulations

The main difficulties at present in placing the pupils of any of the schools in theatrical employment can mostly be found in the fact that the teaching plans of these institutions are not uniform and not many-sided. The working out, therefore, of a teaching and examination scheme for free German dancers, must be done as quickly as possible and it must be given a corresponding legal foundation. The establishment of local branches, with respect to appointments, which will look after the dancers free at present, provide for practice times and eventually further training: Hence practice places must be set up, to give those dancers temporarily without professional employment an opportunity to practice and to improve their technique.

222 Marion Kant
A central body will name the cities and the local practice places, which could be within an already existing school. Just as in other branches of the arts, e.g., music, visual arts, architecture, etc., a legally based foundation was required in order to develop themselves further, so in the case of dance it is absolutely vital to promote and to encourage dance as a science. This science, built upon ancient laws of movement, gives in its unfolding form that clarity that leads to completeness. Closely tied to it is dance notation, which affords in circles that have mastered it a valuable means by which to transmit dance compositions and choreographic inspiration.

IV. Final Clarification of the membership of the proper association

In order to settle the basis for the free German dancers, it is absolutely necessary that the professional structure [“standischen Aufbau” in original - JS] and especially the jurisdiction of the dance practitioners, both teachers and pupils, be clearly recognized. The present inevitable clashes and conflict, created by the inclusion of the German free dancers for organizational purposes on the basis of the Reich Culture Chamber Law and its first executive order and also Order 20 of the president of the Reich Theater Chamber must be completely eliminated. The claim on the free German dancers from other associations is not only groundless but harmful for their economic survival. A clear separation of jurisdictions is essential, in order to realize the great idea of the establishment and development of German art dance and its practitioners. In order to carry out this clear separation, it is necessary to let the heads of the offices in the relevant ministries, Ministry of Education and Propaganda Ministry, present and solve existing conflicts and to prepare the necessary directives.

German Dance Festival 1934, Berlin, 9 - 16 December, Theater on Horst-Wessel-Platz
Presented by the Union of German Dance Theaters, General Director Rudolf von Laban

To Herr Reich Minister for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda, Chairman of the Reich Culture Chamber, Dr. Josef Goebbels (13 March 1935)

Dear Herr Minister,

On behalf of all the dancers assembled in the German Dance Festival 1934, I express to you as the chairman of the Reich Culture Chamber our hearty thanks for the exceptional support that you were good enough to give us on the occasion of the Festival. The goal of the German Dance Festival 1934, to make the character and value of German artistic dance and to demonstrate its cultural significance, was fully realized and confirmed by the great participation of the public and its resonance in public and press. The Festival also showed us the path to the solution of further tasks, which are of great value for the development of German artistic dance.

1. Elevation and Encouragement of the achievements in the area of dance. Achievement rests on schooling, which must be fixed through clear work and assessment methods. Cinematic visual and extensive discussion material about the German Dance Festival, its artists, works and resonance, could furnish a good base for dance education and its development. A thoroughly new order in this area is desperately needed.
2. Employment provision for free dancers. As a result of the Festival, wide circles and several places have become interested in dance performances. The absence of a central assistance agency for free dancers makes it impossible to capture this interest for performances and appearances by guest artists, although the existing economic misery among free dancers could be reduced through it.
3. Expansion of the "German Dance Theater." It has long been our wish to put on dance festivals and performances within the framework of a "German Dance Theater," and we are grateful that in the Third Reich it has finally become possible to enable us to create the first "German Dance Festival." The corps of German dancers regards it as their duty to proceed along the way just trodden and hopes to have your counsel and interest.

We take the liberty of sending you the collected press judgments and other publications about the "German Dance Festival 1934." Heil Hitler! (signed) Rudolf von Laban

This is the present state of things: on account of several requests for leave and illness the meeting to discuss the examination scheme must take place on || July at three in the afternoon.

I am sure that we could finish the examination scheme in two days, especially since at present the atmosphere seems to be favorable. I regret it very much that these meetings fall in the period when you are undergoing treatment but believe that we cannot carry on without you.

Absence for Sundays must be notified by Friday evening at the latest. There must be silence in the quarters after 22.30, so that other guests and participants can be undisturbed. Guests and participants should be having a holiday in spite of the work. The office of the Deutsche Tanzbiihne is to be found in the Gasthof Ziedrich. Office hours for participants are, weekdays from 9 to 12 and 13 to 15 hours. Post for participants should be directed to the private quarters and not addressed to the office.______ All participants take upon themselves a burden of responsibility toward the National-Socialist State. The future of many of our colleagues, indeed the future of German Dance as such, depends on the smooth running of the course. Each must accept the duty to be responsible for the strict discipline of all participants—as in any case such behavior should be self-evident in our National-Socialist State.

Instructions given by the management of the training camp as well as those given by responsible assistants or teaching personnel appointed by the management are to be obeyed most strictly. Outside the hours of training, each must be aware of the responsibility undertaken through their participation in the Deutsche Tanzbühne and thus towards the authorities as well. Any transgression against the substance of the regulation cited above will result in the immediate expulsion from the camp.

Dear Herr von Keudell,

The attached article by Friedl Brauer “A Look at German Art Dance” appeared in the October issue of the journal Der Tanz (Berlin). The article, which came out just before the dance festivals in Germany in a dance magazine produced in this country, does damage to the work just initiated to promote German Art Dance. For this reason, we feel an obligation to draw the matter to your attention, all the more so since Der Tanz is the only German dance magazine with a regular and substantial circulation abroad (Paris, Warsaw, Prague, London, New York). It provides space for articles in both English and German and provides foreign dance periodicals with running reports about the German dance scene.

The author of the attached article, Friedl Brauer, was a trainee student at the Wigman School, Dresden, from February 1928 to 15 July 1930. She was an enthusiastic supporter of Zionist ideas and, because she had no funds herself, paid 228 Marion Kant for her course in part through the support of the Zionist Society. After her training, she taught in Tel Aviv, from which place she went on to Alexandria for two or three years. As far as we know, she has only been in Germany on one brief visit, so she could hardly have had the opportunity to follow the development of artistic dance in Germany.

A few weeks ago, she sent Mary Wigman the subsequently printed article and remarked that it would be printed in Greece. Of course, Mary Wigman did not answer the letter nor did she reply to the article, as indeed she has not replied to any attacks that come from abroad. Special motives are clearly behind the composition and publication of this article, which have nothing to do with the matter in hand and which we hardly need to elucidate. We regard it as dangerous for the well-being of German Art Dance if such attempts to undermine it were to continue and request therefore that an official response be forthcoming as soon as possible.

To Herr von Keudell, Reich Min Pop Enl and Prop
24 October 1935
Dear Herr von Keudell,
In addition to the letter, which the pedagogic director of my school has written to you today about the dance magazine Der Tanz, I should like to add the following: Would you regard it as appropriate in the present situation if I were to write to the journal in question to forbid them absolutely in future to publish my photograph or that of my dance group? I am of the opinion that the German dance community as a whole should break off all relations with the magazine, but how and through whom should it be carried out? Since the editors of the magazine Der Tanz will certainly have completed by now all the necessary preparations for the publication of the November issue, I am particularly concerned to have your view of the matter as soon as possible and thus in the appropriate circumstance to send my letter at once to the editors.
With warm greetings and many thanks for your efforts
your devoted
(signed) Mary Wigman

Insight into the German Art Dance by Friedl Brauer
(The author is a former Wigman pupil and directs a modern dance school in Alexandria, Egypt. See also “Questions of the day in Dance” in this issue)
[Italics are used in the text below as in the original — JS]

I. The Wigman Dance
The Wigman dance — misunderstood as the New German Dance — is called the “Central European Method” abroad. It is an art of the spontaneous cry from the soul, art as expression of a powerful, intoxicating being, of a solitary phenomenon. It is actually for Wigman. It expresses only her and her alone and her lonely, lofty world. Wigman is the great dance genius of our times. Nobody will or can deny her that (least of all I, her former pupil). Her grandiose, creative urge gives her the right to step over all the laws of development of a new style but only her; not her disciples. Here lies the rub. The large number of her followers — professional and lay dancers, critics, enthusiasts for dance on the outside — simply misunderstand or choose not to understand that they have got her message utterly wrong.

Proposition: a genius creates the urge to the new, but is incapable of leading or forming it into a valid style. That is the way it is in dance. By the glamour of her incredible, fluid radiance and power of suggestion, Mary Wigman can make her followers capable of dance but she can never educate them to dance as art. [Tanzkunst - JS]

A genius does not need to learn, and thus cannot teach. The disciples must learn and desperately need a teacher to do that. The genius can ignore all the rules and still create great art. The crowd of professional dancers cannot afford to ignore a single rule of organic development, if art is to avoid artifice. In their ecstatic credulity a whole generation of Mary Wigman followers — the female dancers between 30 and 35 years of age — have been led astray. They are easily recognized. In their work, they are willful, and through their constant clinging to a boundless gushing enthusiasm completely undisciplined. They are grand only in soulful agitation and all too individualistic in the mysteries of empty worlds of feeling. They cannot separate the dualities — chaos/cosmos and realm of nature/realm of art. Those drawn to the occult among them go under in an ecstasy that is little more than unwilled streaming out of the individual self flowing back into the same self without ever penetrating the realm of artistic creation. By exploiting this element of ecstasy, even a lay dancer can succeed in dragging her audience into the rush of intoxication and in fascinating them. Art, professional dance, has nothing to do with this stuff. Marion Kant Dance becomes art when the intellectual-sensual, symbol-creating elements in the form that give a work its completeness through their rule-bound development, go along with ecstatic-rhythmic elements. For the goal of every art is the work. In artistic work, artists perceive, visibly and audibly, their experience as mediated for others. The unwilled stream of unconscious experiences translates itself in conscious transmission of rule-based forms. If we want dance to be recognized as art by this definition, we have to submit to its laws.

The countless hangers-on in the New Dance have exhausted themselves for years in "Indian-Grecian-medieval-martyr-gestures." Their range of dance expressions have stiffened in structures grown old. They scarcely imagine that—without knowing nor wanting it—they are making the fortress of their "Ideal Dance" an ideal object for the next generation to storm. Only a few of the followers of Mary Wigman, the small number with self-control, have managed in good time to work themselves out of the contradictions of their position by accepting the need for harsh criticism of their deficiencies. After they left Mary Wigman, they stood alone. Since nobody could show them the way forward, they courageously took the road backward to classical dance, the widely scorned ballet.

II. Ballet

The magnificent style of classical dance arose from a clearly conceived system. Style as Expression. Two premises directed this style: inner discipline and outer conquest. Hard, ruthless, unforgiving against oneself and the body in training, this discipline created a special art of dance and bore it for several centuries with success across all of Europe. Overcoming body weight by dancing on the tips of the feet, the masterly capacity in the jumps, the melody of beautiful gestures, the exemplary technique, provided ballet with the one permanently established style in the history of dance as art.

When today we look for something spiritually akin to that in order to apply it to our new dance, we look back on Pavlova, but we seek the rules and the form, not the individual movements, to imitate. Imitating what she did would be a dreadful lie, inner and outer falsehood. Pavlova's art arose from a form shaped by intellect and that form was in turn the expression on an inner security. That is completely lacking in the Wigman dances; but New German Dance must and will have it—that security coming from within. Classical dance enjoyed its absolute validity in a time and place in which it emerged according to the laws of its inner development. For us dancers of the twentieth century, it has no unconditionally obligatory models. A return of ballet that would lead and direct the entire realm of art dance, is out of the question, as unthinkable as the return of Homeric verse forms, classical architecture, or the Greek ideal of beauty.

A new style of dance is emerging. The land of its birth is undoubtedly Germany. Its precursor is the LABAN-WIGMAN-dance. Now the task is to stretch the cord from the exemplary style of classical dance to an equivalent style for New Dance. However the new style may develop, however different it may look from ballet, for it will have to adapt itself to the new technological age—it must retain one common aspect of the old style, if it is to survive: inner self-control, that is, a technical, bodily order, worked out, not capricious, form, this-worldliness, competence. III. The New German Dance and the New Dancers

Since a new style that has become necessary in an art form must be born within a people [Volk - JS] at a given time, it must also logically grow out of that people. It cannot be dictated, neither by a genius nor by the professional group of artists. That holds true for dance and the formulation of a new style. The genius—in this case, Mary Wigman—excludes herself by the very fact that genius is always a law unto itself. The corps of serious professional dancers fulfills its highest task as embodiment of the art dance of its epoch by celebrating it. They too exclude themselves. The real heralds of the new style are the youngsters just coming up, who are in the schools today, who are being unnecessarily held back, because the leader today no longer has the strength to master the currents which she has called forth. The New Style bubbles in these youngsters, and it is the task of the dance teachers to carve out the emerging form. (But where are the real teachers capable of the New Dance? Everything floats in the wake of the brilliant Mary Wigman, who is incapable of educating.)

The ideal dance pedagogue must have an inner vocation to teaching work. He must be himself a fully and thoroughly trained dancer. He must not cling complacently to his "favorite system" but must love and dance the art in all its forms and be able to teach this many-facetted legacy to his pupils. DANCE attracts all those who can see. But it can only be created and transmitted by those who have wholly absorbed its laws in and by themselves.

The birth of the New Dance will declare itself completely in the moment when the coming young corps of dancers is no longer sacrificed to the conflict Wigman/Ballet. The incorporation of ballet classes in the Wigman schools and vice versa the inclusion of "Expressive Dance Technique" in the ballet schools have created an unhealthy compromise. Both systems consider the other as "hostile", an unwelcome and disturbing appendage. I wish that art dance in general and the young and youngest should stay free of falsity and remain under the driving force of one will.

The New Dancers will in any case look different. Fate has determined them as the fighters for a dance form disciplined by mind. Together with inner and outer self-control, they will bring their passion and their confession of the new faith, which arises from spiritual realms but purified of all sentimentality and affect. They want to set the form. They want to hammer out the style and begin the "counter-revolution of order." They want the dance, their dance to come forth from the isolation into which under the leadership of Mary Wigman it has been banned.

In the realm of dance, let the geniuses create only from the underworlds; for art dance as professional work of culture, we need secure, clear thinking, discriminating and discerning TEACHERS.

To Herrn von Keudell, RMfPopEnlaProp, department IX
25 October 1935

Attached, I send you the final draft of our preliminary report for the opening ceremony of the Dietrich Eckart-Theater, which we forwarded to Herr Dr. Diem. In addition, I include a short minute of my conversation with Herr Dr. Wallaschek, about which I spoke to you on the telephone shortly before my departure. It would be very important and helpful in the interest of dance and of the great tasks ahead if Dr. Wallaschek could begin his work at once, assuming that the plan is acceptable to you. The following text, corrected and cleaned up:

I shall be in Berlin for the meeting, which will probably take place, and I am at your service if I can help in any way. With German greetings, Heil Hitler!

The German Destiny
Basic idea for a dedication ceremony for the opening of the Dietrich Eckart-Theater within the framework of the opening ceremonies in the Reich Sport Field

Participants: German movement and dance choirs from all the districts of the Reich
Individual speakers and choral speakers, singing groups, orchestra with bells, fanfares, drummers, etc.

This production is the first large-scale joint performance of all the German movement and dance choirs. It is designed to show how choric movement is the expressive language of our time.

Entry of the choirs with music and singing

The herald announces the meaning of the production, which is designed to show the destiny of the German people. Beginning with what is now and draws us together, the production calls us back to what was, in order to let us experience the sense of the present age with joy and thankfulness. In the course of the performance, we experience the horrors of war and the miseries of the postwar period. Battered soldiers, wailing women and mothers, rabble-rousers, and somewhere the few who maintain and fight for the faith in the German people, in discipline and restraint, in its healthy core: its soul and its capacity.

Documentary Appendix 233

The warning cry to recollect and arise sounds with bells and fanfare, the storm song of Dietrich Eckart ("Germany Awake"). Gradually the believers gather more and more until all Germans confess their loyalty to the people's community ["Volksgemeinschaft" in the original — JS]. With joy they go to work and respect the work of others: the land worker, the artisan, the factory worker — worker of the fist, the worker of the brain and spirit. The finale a great work symphony ["Arbeitssymphonie" in the original — JS]. Discipline and respect reign again, joy returns. German women and mothers step forward. After work is done, everybody unites in prayer. In fresh, natural joy in the festivity, the choir of all swings and finds its way to the German summer wheel (i.e., the swastika — JS), the symbol of our ancestors for our people's community, of eternal light, to which we all strive. The wheel dissolves in gross, turning, jubilant circles. Symbolic middle point.

For the overall strategy and rehearsal of the speaking choirs: Intendant Holl
Participants: Amateur dancers from the Reich (members of the Reich Association), Extras, comrades [“Volkgenossen” in the original — JS] from Berlin. [This section was handed in twice — MK]

Implementation: The above description arises from the results of a meeting of the choral dance directors who have been considered and consulted in Rangsdorf. The choirs, which are being considered are original choirs from the North (Bremen, Hamburg, Kiel, Berlin), West (Essen, Mülheim, Diisseldorf, Krefeld, Neuss), East (Dresden, Breslau). The choirs will be lead by the best known choral directors and trained in the home schools. Eight days before the celebration they will be gathered and united in Berlin. The tripart direction in dance, song, and word will have to make the boundaries more precise among the musical, verbal, and movement aspects. The overall picture of the choirs will correspond to the spirit of the Dietrich Eckart-Theater just as the poetic, choreographic, and tonal creations will. Since the work has arisen from the community, the organizational preparation of the gathering must take account of the character of the celebration. Members of the choirs await May 1936 as the time for a communal pilgrimage, in order to give the collective joy in the festival its proper expression and to show the German people’s community [“Volksgemeinschaft” — JS] that choric dance is a new and valuable language expression of our times.

Cost estimates:

* Return fare to Berlin at an average price of 20 RM per person and fifty per cent travel discount for a total of 6,000 RM
* Room and board in Berlin for eight days at a minimal level of existence of 3 RM including city travel for a total of 7,200 RM
* Travel reimbursements for at least three rehearsals and the performance for extras and stand-ins in Berlin for a total of 1,500 RM
* Costumes for ca. 1000 persons, 4,600 RM
* For the preparation in the prescribed places and surroundings a minimal subsidy for rooms, musicians, advertisement, etc. a minimal amount has been calculated (times seven choirs) at 7,000 RM
* Valuable small choirs and local amateur dance groups from the surrounding areas will also be included. Thus the choral dance directors in the entire Reich will get a new impulse for their work and their work can be used to assist and strengthen the entire activity.
* For administration, choreography, stage direction, movement choir leaders, singing choir leaders, poetry, music and scenery, in all 7,000 RM
* A small sum has been set aside for a very modest honorarium for the individual leading artists, more or less in the form of a monthly reimbursement of their costs
* For orchestra, speech, and song choirs, 2,000 RM
* These must be drawn from the Berlin area and will need modest reimbursement for travel and subsidies to the many individual rehearsals at the Dietrich Eckart-Theater in the final week before the ceremony
* Administration, office, inspection trips, 5,000 RM
* An extremely tightly controlled unified direction will be necessary from the beginning.

A particularly important organizational precondition, which was emphasized by all the choral dance directors, is the granting of a five-day leave to all the amateur dancers who are professionally active in the various offices of the Reich. Preparations must begin at once, because the rehearsals and arrangements will take at least six months. As a result, a part of the necessary money must be ready to be drawn upon from the very beginning.

I submit in the annex the program of the German Dance Festival 1935 and observe that the coming performances of this festival of dance represent a very marked step forward compared to last year. Of course, even this year’s performances represent only “the first steps” in an art form that had been neglected unjustly by the previous regime during its fourteen years. Even in this year it is foreseeable that dancers will soon be 90 per cent dependent on benefits of the labor exchanges for their survival. Although the means available to the Ministry even in this year to alleviate the misery remain restricted, the situation of the German dance corps has improved as a result of a variety of organizational measures.

The Berlin employment office of the Propaganda Ministry has proven itself. Through Directive No. 48 of the Reich Theater Chamber “the dancers’ basic law” has been issued for Germany and an end has been made to insecurity and arbitrariness in this area. In a short time Master Workshops (to spare the nerves of the Reich Education Ministry, I avoid the term dance col- leges) will be offering the leading personalities in this field the necessary further train- ing. I hope that the Master Workshops will begin their activities on | April 1936 and that the budgetary means available to the Ministry will alleviate the greatest need.

Documentary Appendix 237

With respect to the attached program, I would like to remark that Palucca on the 3rd of November, Kreutzberg on the 5th and Mary Wigman on the 9th, together with their master students, will be showing very great works of art, for which they can really envy us abroad. On the 8th of November the Hamburg Ballet under Frau Svedlund will perform a very beautiful dance piece, before which individual pieces by one of the most gifted of the coming generation of dancers at the State Opera will be performed. All in all I recommend a visit to the theater on the 8th.

The 7th of November is less interesting. The Cologne Ballet Company will show a short creation, which — like the majority of such works — repeats traditional material. (After the establishment of the Master Workshops that should improve). The first half of the evening will be filled by a series of master students of Wigman. I cannot recommend attendance on November the 6th. The dance group Giin- ther-Munich has an enthusiastic and large public in Germany. Its dance creations are merely artistic artisanship, if rather good artisanship.

On Monday, the 4th November, three of Palucca's master pupils will perform, of whom Vogelsang has given grounds for high hopes. Following that, a lay dance group (workers, teachers) will perform "The Birth of Work" by Lotte Wernicke. This form of dance composition, together with the dance matinee on the 1st of November, at which the Hamburg Work Circle under the direction of Frau Lola Rogge will perform The Amazons, has significance in its principles. Here, works of art are performed in which the original artistic creativity of the most varied classes of the people are manifested. I am convinced that this art of lay participation of great masses of the people will also have decisive influence on the further development of the ritual fields [“Thingplatz” in the original - JS]. For this reason, and also because one of these creative dances, namely The Birth of Work, is in my view quite extraordinarily beautiful, I should be particularly grateful if the Herr Reich Minister or one of his representatives could give me his opinion. I could easily imagine that in addition to a series of outstanding individual performances, just this work (The Birth of Work) would arouse the interest of the Fiihrer and Reich Chancellor. When this festival is over, I shall take the liberty of preparing a possible program for the Fiihrer and the Reich Chancellor. On the 10th of November, this year’s Dance Festival will finish as it did last year with a gala performance at the Berlin State Opera. The absolutely excellent Barberina will be performed, followed by a rather boring, rural dance composition based on Lisztian motifs. Barberina is so outstanding, and shows how the aims of the Propaganda Ministry can be developed appropriately through the art of ballet hitherto largely ignored in Germany, that I strongly recommend a visit to the first half of the dance evening.

Attached: program 238 Marion Kant 1936 Document 25 (BUNDESARCHIV 50.01 244) Department IX (Keudell) To Herr Ministerial Councilor Hanke, in house Berlin, 4 March 1936

Herr State Secretary presented my submission of 15 February of this year to the Herr Minister and I received notice after this audience from Herr Ministerial Director Dr. Greiner that the Herr Minister

1. is in principle in agreement with my submission;
2. wishes to see a stronger expansion of the professional section for ballet together with attraction of younger dance teaching personnel to the ballet professional section;
3. wants to see a financial summary.

In the implementation of the above directive with respect to number 2, I attach in the appendix a summary, which contains a list of the objects taught, the probable number of students, the financial compensation of the teaching personnel and recommendations for the teaching personnel to be chosen. To this summary I add the observation that in it the ballet is not only treated equally with the so-called German Dance (concert dance) but actually represents the larger professional section. There are thus the professional section for ballet dance and the slightly smaller professional section for the so-called concert dance. Every student of a dance professional school can choose the professional section that he wishes to attend. In any case, students of the two aforementioned professional associations will be required to attend the professional lectures to be seen in the appendix and to show knowledge of dance direction.

I further report that the financial compensation set out represents an approximate estimate. The corresponding monetary amounts will change, probably be reduced. I append further as a second appendix an outline of the total budget of the Master Workshops, which has been substantively and financially approved by Herr Dr. Greiner. This budgetary entry has been carefully and precisely estimated and will in all probability not come down much. Finally, I should like to add that in the case of the teaching personnel, we are dealing with experienced and long-serving master teachers, whose names—and that is very much in the interests of the development of this dance higher education—enjoy a great resonance and drawing power in Germany and abroad.

The Master Workshops, which are to be created, must meet the highest standards expected by the highly qualified students from home and abroad. While it is deeply encouraging that there are now a great many young dancing talents who are beginning to show what they can do on stage or podium, these personalities do not, in my view, have the maturity yet to serve as teachers in the first German dance higher schools. These promising beginners do not belong to the teaching personnel on the master level, but as practicing dancers on the stages.

Starting from these premises, I should like to suggest the following personalities for the professional section "ballet":

1. For director of the professional section (Frau Maudrick) we have the ballet mistress of the Prussian State Theater, who has qualified herself in recent years as the most intelligent and competent ballet mistress that we have. She must be in her late thirties.
2. For teaching personnel for ballet, the twenty-four-year-old but outstanding teacher Fraulein Rauser is suggested. Her ability at master level has been sufficiently tested, and she had an opportunity to show her ability in conducting a short rehearsal for the Herr Reich Minister on the occasion of his visit to Rangsdorf.
3. For instruction in national dance forms (ballet) Fraulein Koster, a younger member of the Ballet of the Reich Opera, seems suitable.
4. Ballet training will be in the very competent hands of the soloist of the Reich Opera, Herr Stammer.
5. Finally, as one of the most attractive figures of the ballet professional section, we have engaged the world-famous ballet dancer Harald Kreutzberg.

I ask you, my dear Herr Hanke, bearing in mind the Olympic Games that will soon "descend" on us, to be good enough to submit my memorandum as soon as possible to the Herr Reich Minister. I would also like to say to you that I should be extraordinarily grateful if you were in a position to arrange a short audience with Herr Reich Minister to allow me to add a few verbal explanations to my memorandum. Heil Hitler! (signed) K.

1. to all regional directors of the RMPE&P Dance is among those artistic activities for which I am responsible. All male and female dancers as well as the amateur dance movement have been organized in the Reich Theater Chamber. Training regulations for male and female dancers were laid down in Directive No. 48 and in the executive provisions "Dance in the Reich The- ater Chamber" (published in January No. 2 of the Biihne). The stage certificate con- cerns the provision of work for all those racial comrades (Volksgenossen) active in the field of dance. All these measures are not sufficient to overcome effectively the pre- vailing economic and spiritual emergency of an artistic activity that was neglected by previous governments.

240 Marion Kant As part of a series of work creation measures the Propaganda Ministry has cre- ated "The German Dance Theater" (Berlin, Potsdamerstrasse 27), which works together with the Reich Theater Chamber under direction of the Propaganda Min- istry.

Reply ONLY with the corrected text:

As one of its first acts, the Dance Theater has opened a workshop at 27b Potsdamer Street for dancers who are presently out of work. Participants who voluntarily join the program of the workshop receive free training rooms and free instruction on the most varied areas of dance by selected teaching personnel. The especially needy may be granted monthly support. The directing staff of the dance workshops have had a good deal of success in coordinating the work with the stage certificate to ensure that participants have permanent employment possibilities or to help them by organizing guest appearances or tours, for example, in connection with "Kraft Durch Freude" [Strength Through Joy, a Nazi mass recreation organization - JS] or through performances in seaside resorts, spas, or small cities at least until such time at which they can be permanently reintegrated into the work process.

The usefulness of these first German dance workshops, which are incidentally open to every dancer in Germany, is obvious. It is equally clear that one Berlin workshop will not be adequate for the whole territory of the Reich and that further workshops of the kind described must be created. Given the importance of dance, which represents the oldest art form in German cultural development, I request that you consult state and communal authorities in the area of your jurisdiction, and in consultation with the regional director of the Reich Theater Chamber, arrange to create a workshop of the kind mentioned.

The Reich Theater Chamber and the German Dance Theater are available to assist you in matters professional and personal, since the choice of a director for the program is the most important element in the success of these work creation measures. Please report by 30 May 1936 on your progress.

The necessity for the establishment of Master Workshops for dance is generally recognized. The German press, the entire profession desires them. They have been foreseen and provided for in the directives of the Propaganda Ministry and the Reich Theater Chamber. Outstanding individuals suitable by professional and personal characteristics are available. Budgetary means are at hand. Over the years the Propaganda Ministry has granted to ballet, artistic dance, and the other sub-specialties in dance absolute equality with respect to their future developments to the universal applause of all participants and the entire press. There is across the wide and wonderful dance scene no longer any reason for battles for control. Each dance form can unfold in its own way, and the state leadership can confine itself to excluding unfounded attempts to disturb things by individuals and groups with no direct interest.

As far the time set for the erection of the Master Workshops is concerned, a large number of very valuable comrades [“Volksgenossen” - JS] would be impeded in their development if the deadline for opening them were further postponed. In addition the international dance contest on the occasion of the Olympics is now very close, and according to today’s report nineteen foreign nations have accepted invitations. The Master Workshops for those individuals and groups who will uphold Germany’s position as the leading country for art dance in the world have now become desperately in need for the final preparations for the competition. The competitions with the expected presence of many from abroad, to whom Herr Reichminister Dr. Goebbels issued invitations, begin on 15 July, that means in only three months. The German representatives in these truly very difficult battles will be greatly harmed if the authorization is not given soon.

The activity of the workshops will proceed very modestly and completely unobserved by the wider public. I suggest therefore

1. To begin with the work end of April;
2. That there be no press communiqué or opening ceremony;
3. Instead of the eighteen instructors originally foreseen only seven should now be engaged. (One or two guest appearance can be arranged if need be.) At present there are in the Berlin dance studios, which have been for the last nine months providing the unemployed and starving participants, in addition to an excellent training, with work projects of the value of about 80,000 RM, five instructors (two ballet, two artistic dance, and one director) already working there. Nobody will notice it and in any case it will be a logical next step if instead of five there are seven instructors at work beginning at the end of April.
4. The arrangement remains, as submitted to and approved by the Herr Reich Minister in principle, a ballet class, an art dance class, and a class for general dance studies and stage direction.
5. The Master Workshops remain provisional for the financial year 1936. As a reflection of my suggestions in numbers | to 5, the existence of the Master Workshops will not reach the public. The work will be carried on in a very modest way and yet the success desired will be achieved. I request approval, Heil Hitler! (signed) Sch[lésser], (signed) Keudell 244

Re: Verification of previous membership of the dissolved Marxist parties
According to the Law for the Re-establishment of the Professional Civil Service, paragraph 2a and 4 in association with paragraph 15, loc. cit., persons who belong to the KPD or communist auxiliary and substitute organizations or who have been active in a Marxist (communist or social democratic) sense, are to be dismissed from the service. Exception may be made, if before 30 January 33 they have joined a party or association that placed itself in support of the government of national renewal and have proved themselves in the national movement.

Verification of the questionnaires has yielded the fact ten persons in the attached list have made incomplete entries about their former membership in Marxist parties or associations, so that in these cases a further detailed verification is necessary. Documentary Appendix 245

It is requested that the corresponding further investigations be requested from the Secret State Police [Geheime Staatspolizei — JS] or the organs of the NSDAP. to enable us to take a position on the basis of more precise evidence and according to the presently operative regulations for dismissal. It must further be decided how to proceed with present members of the NSDAP, resp. members of the allied organizations, who as earlier members or supporters of Marxist parties and associations only became members after 30 January 33 but have since then proved themselves. Among such persons in the attached list are the stage hands Franz Kaluzny and Karl Seltz. The former according to his entries was from 1921 to 1923 and from 1925 to 30 July 1930 a member of the KPD, from 24 April 1933 a member of the NSDAP and from 8 July 1933 a member of the NSKK [Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrerkorps, National-Socialist Corps of Motorists - JS].

The latter belonged to the KPD from autumn 1927 to spring 1928 but since 26 April 1933 has been a member of the NSDAP and NSKK.

In agreement with the view of the Obmann of the enterprise’s unit of the German Labor Service and with reference to decree of 20 May 1936 —I B 1290/20.5 — according to which, with approval of the Herr Reich Minister and even on the basis of the German Civil Code, persons who in specially constituted situations may be reinstated, I believe that I should ask now for the further employment of both the two stage hands.

Ref. Cunz Berlin, 9 July 1936

1. Minute

The dance school of Mary Wigman gave an insight into the workshop of her artistic dance work through an evening of pedagogic studies and dances in the Bach Hall, Liitzow Street on 3 July. In the first part, which concerned her teaching method and dance training work, the directress demonstrated that she is today one of the strongest forces in the area of group dance training, which is decisive for the further development of dance. Her strength lies above all in her convincing execution of studies, études, and dramatic movement pieces by her students designed for concert hall or stage. This irreplaceable educational task in group training should be put as soon as possible — for example from the 1st of October this year — at the service of the “German Workshops for Dance,” a measure that was proposed at the time of the establishment of the “Master Workshops” but because of cautious dispositions with the dance budget has not yet been considered.

As in the past two years, there is once again a request from Frau Wigman to receive authorization in the fiscal year 1936/37 for a great state subsidy to maintain her old, private “dance group.” Apart from the fact that other private dance schools and groups of importance operate without any subsidy at all, there is the fact that Documentary Append______ Besides it must be further considered that the Wigman group, which consists largely of fully professionally trained and independent forces, has in the last two years fulfilled its circle of tasks and has already declined from its highest point of artistic capacity entirely apart from a rather cramped general attitude that has arisen as a result within this artificially maintained "touring star troop." The future tasks of Frau Wigman must lie in a constantly renewed group dance effort in the workshops and especially with fresh, unspoiled young forces. In this way, a live group of workshops will be created new each time, which can stand any assessment.

There is no compelling argument to finance once again the previous old group, for which an honorarium of 3,000 RM has been allocated one more time for the "International Dance Competition" in July. If they can maintain themselves, like other private undertakings, through contracts for guest appearances or similar means, that is their affair. On the other hand, there is every reason to save every available penny from the dance budget for this year and the first quarter of next year for the building up of the Master Workshops.

2. To Frau Mary Wigman, Dresden, Bautzen Strasse 107
The German Dance Theater informed you some time ago that with regard to the provision of considerable sums to maintain your existing group, nothing can be undertaken for the time being, because the establishment of the German Master Workshops and other important tasks in the year of the Olympic Games do not permit any further allocations from the budget. If the guest performances that you have in mind cannot be secured by firm commitments from the sponsors, it might be advisable to advise the finished members of your group to seek alternative professional employment so that they can take suitable steps to secure their livelihoods in the coming theater season. A renewed assessment in the studio for your artistic dance work makes it more than ever desirable that beginning with the new semester at the Master Workshops, a suitable form can be found to bind your admirable force in the area of group dance training to this leading institution of the Reich.

Dear Frau Wigman,

After your conversation with my desk officer responsible for dance, I have to communicate to you the following: With all due recognition of the striking artistic work that you have accomplished with your present dance group during this year and which it is to be hoped will once more be demonstrated at the "International Dance Competition," there can in principle be, as you are aware, no question for the fiscal year 1936/37 of any sort of subsidy for private dance groups of any kind. There it seems advisable that you communicate to the present members of your group this situation and intimate to them to stand on their own feet professionally, insofar as this is justifiable in artistic or dance pedagogic terms. At the same time, there is the wish that it may be a firm obligation on the part of all those professionally finished pupils who make their way independently into the world of German dance that they honor their world-famous mistress in a manner she deserves and has earned.

Laban, associated with the RT hCh To RMfPopEnlaProp
14 August 1936

In connection with my report on the trial semester of the German Master Workshops for Dance in the summer of 1936, I make the following applications:

The provisional division of tasks, which arises from the specifications of the interim budget, is to be extended by the development of the workshops for younger dancers as a preparatory training center for master candidates and applicants. The German Dance Archive, resp. its section “College Archive,” is to be permanently incorporated in the German Master Workshops.

Documentary Appendix 249

The right to distribute scholarships and work subsidies for talented Masters candidates of the preparatory training center is to be newly regulated. The expansion of performances of young dancers generates income, which must be offset against the work subsidies. The small additional contribution granted in the provisional budget, which is necessary to the proposed expansion, as well as the additional costs arising from extended instructional measures and scholarships, has been easily covered through the previous savings and the income from the Master Workshops and the Dance Theater.

In personnel matters, I suggest:

Ballet Master Trojanowski is to be relieved of his present activity in the Master Workshops and with the same salary as before to be re-engaged as a teacher in the preliminary instruction center and as adjunct for ballet at the College Archive (previously national dance instruction at the Master Workshops).

Albrecht Knust is to be engaged as instructor for dance theory of the German Master Workshops for Dance and for the preliminary instruction center as well as director of the College Archive.

Performance director and choreographer Miss Ivers is to be engaged for instruction and the artistic stage direction of the preliminary instruction center and of the German Master Workshops for Dance (up to now only attached to the Master Workshops and German Dance Theater as artistic organization directress).

Choreographer Miss Snell is to be engaged as operations manager and propagandist of the performances of the preliminary instruction center (as part-time assistant at the performances of the Master Workshops for Dance). (Previously propaganda directress of the Dance Festival Competitions)

Bookkeeper and cashier Ebrecht is to be paid from October 1936 450 RM because of the extension of the managerial responsibilities. (For a transitional month Ebrecht drew a salary of 350 RM and from the Ist of May during the implementation and the winding up of the Dance Competitions drew a salary of 450 RM for the month.)

As guest instructors, well-known dancers such as Kreutzberg, Giinther, Wigman, etc. are to be invited. They can be engaged for individual lessons or lesson series in the corresponding instructional plan.

Willi Masseck, hitherto messenger engaged at the Festival Competitions, should be employed by the German Master Workshops as a school guard.

The organizational preliminaries must begin now so that in early October this year a smooth functioning of the operation can be guaranteed.

Documentary Appendix 251

Dear Herr Cunz,

You can easily imagine how hard I find it to stand aside or more accurately to lie in bed during the beginning of the realization of one of the most important tasks for German dance. The number of hours I can stand up are still rationed and counted. I have had a very serious session with Geheimrat Rémheld, one of the leading authorities in the field of my special illness. He assures me that were I to consider leaving or taking up indeed any even partial resumption of my professional work, I should endanger all prospect of recovery. Two or three times I have neglected such medical advice and in addition to a progressive deterioration of my condition, I have had to accept ever-smaller periods of my capacity to work.

So I have decided to submit to the Ministry the medical certificate together with a request to prolong my leave of absence. I do not want to neglect to thank you for your recent friendly lines and to tell you how pleased I am that you have committed yourself—with or without me—to the work of schooling for master and other dance pupils more or less competently begun by me. We have to carry on and it must become a great and exemplary affair. In what way, how or how much I can help in that endeavor is today difficult to assess.

At any rate, I hope to be in Berlin soon in some sort of consultative capacity. Until then, as has been planned from the first moment, I have ordered the completion of the previous well-tried planned hourly program of study. One will have first to know the type and number of pupils before new dispositions can be considered. Through regular reports of the offices and teaching personnel, I hope to be in a position to be able to prepare the next steps. The following text is OCRed from a book.

Rolf Cunz, Section VI Note for the files to Section IB, Herr Kallus in House 28 September 1936 The request of the director of the German Master Workshops for Dance who is presently undergoing clinical treatment, for a prolongation of his leave, which ends on 1 October is approved by Section VI for two reasons: 1. It is so that the explanation offered by the person in question in the attached private letter to the competent section chief, Herr Cunz, is correct. Laban has recently suffered strong relapses in his illness and has had to take prolonged leave in such cases, because he returned to work before he had entirely recovered. Such a risk must be avoided this time at all costs. Since the disease is chronic, the present case shows that the full exercise of his former activity as the director of substantial state enterprise by the patient is not possible in the long term. 2. The postponed re-assumption of this activity makes the present moment suitable to deal in the interim with the still unsettled questions of personnel. It would come close to the view of Section VI if for the coming weeks the activity of Laban was confined to advising on questions that may arise in the areas of dance notation, choreographic theory, etc. with a corresponding reduction of stipend. In the meantime the artistic and pedagogic work schedule for the Master Workshops continues as planned under close supervision from the Ministry in order to clear up in the next few weeks the outstanding matters of teaching personnel and teaching plan. These compelling and unavoidable facts have been combined in happy coincidence through the application of Rudolf von Laban, so that perhaps even in the Documentary Appendix 253 course of the second experimental semester of the Master Workshops that lasts until the end of March 1937 a solution can be found with respect to the condition of the present director, which will not cause any undue severity. That applies, of course, only to the case that other grounds do not suddenly require the Personnel Section to consider an unexpected personnel decision as a clarification of the situation.

Dear Mr. Schlosser,

I thank you for your letter of 9 October and for your interest in the difficulties that have arisen for me. It would pain me if misunderstandings of a purely economic nature should lead to consequences, and I should like to emphasize to you explicitly how much I remain committed to put my energies at the disposal of the cause of German Dance and also in the service of dance training. Of course, I am extremely sorry, but I made it clear from the beginning that during the winter seasons my obligations here would not allow to share in the involvement of the Master Workshops in the way I should have wished. Nonetheless, I shall continue to promote the training center with my counsel and, insofar as possible, also in pedagogic matters, but I do ask to bear in mind my realities and to respect the agreements in force.

It is not in order, I think, for Herr Ebrecht to write to me as if there were no contract at all or to act as if the existing contract were invalidated without prior consultation in the moment when I am not in a position to give lessons. My contract is not a contract for lessons by the hour but a co-worker's contract and I receive my honorarium not only for the eighteen hours of monthly instruction. My contract specifically states that I am obliged to work with the section and to provide for instruction, that I am to work with my fellow members under my own artistic control, and that the artistic direction of the professional section remains in my hands even during the periods of my absence. My membership of the staff refers to artistic direction and supervision of my assistants.

Naturally I am prepared to make good at least some of the lessons, and if I had not had to excuse myself on the 9th and 10th of October because of a bad case of influenza, I should have given my scheduled lessons in the previous week.

For my part in order to contribute to clearing the misunderstandings, I suggest that until a meeting, which seems to me absolutely necessary, most convenient for me would be the occasion of my Berlin evenings at the beginning of November, we simply let all the outstanding questions and the settlement of differences remain unresolved and arrive at an agreement to the effect that the sums, which in my view were unfairly deducted from my stipend, be offset against my further contractual staff work or that we agree between ourselves an alteration of my contract, which does justice to both parties.

I should be very grateful, dear Herr Schlosser, for a quick response and with best regards. Heil Hitler! (signed) Palucca (handwritten; "Confidential.

What I simply cannot do at present is to be responsible general director of the German Master Workshops and to organize the instruction.

I ask you to be good enough to inform the Herr President of the Reich Theater Chamber with whom I concluded my previous contract of my decision and then to let me know if there are any further steps that I need to take.

To Reich Culture Curator Hans Hinkel
6 November 1936
Minute

The state ballet mistress Lina Gerzer in Stuttgart goes into several urgent issues in the question of training for dancers of the rising generation in a long letter to me, issues, which in any case by order of Dr. Schlosser I have been temporarily assigned to solve as the competent expert. She takes the occasion in one paragraph to point out that the corps of dancers simply cannot understand how, for example, Frau Palucca continues to receive as she has for a long time every assistance as the great German dancer although she is well known as a communist and fought for it openly. To support her charge she encloses a newspaper article, which I shall paraphrase and bring to your attention and consideration.

I share Frau Gerzer's view that the one-sided exaltation of modern expressive dancing as "the new German dance form" is out of place today and it is time to end the battle of the schools "here old ballet, as the Russians do it" and there "modern dance." I am, however, aware that representatives of both sides are unlikely to find a just solution in the general confusion by themselves. From my twenty years of practice as a critical observer and protagonist in this cultural matter, I can see that the only way forward is to arrive at a practical compromise, which will be carried out as the agreed directive for the German Master Workshops for Dance.

In the profession there appears to be nobody who can master and steer things from a superior position of experience and knowledge, I have suggested myself to Pg [Parteigenosse, party comrade - JS] Herr Dr. Schlosser, the president of the Reich Theater Chamber, as desk officer and expert consultant. I shall carry out the disposition of the teaching personnel in the Master Workshops, which are still at a very early stage and will do so until the end of the third trial semester. I am also prepared to undertake from a higher perspective, which is in any case built into my directing status in Section VI, without any additional recompense, the artistic and pedagogic leadership of the development of German Dance taking account of what the profession has done to improve its social and professional status.

Minute: The request by Laban to be relieved of his post as general director of the German Master Workshops for Dance is to be accepted, and an immediate alteration of his contract to be effected, to which he has already made verbal indication of his willingness to agree. The contract concluded with him runs out regularly at the end of March. To that point Laban would have continued to receive his monthly salary of 1,250 RM. In view of the fact that he still has to provide for dependent children and that in the coming months he will be constantly at the service of my relevant desk officer in the elaboration of the increasingly necessary provision of new points of view and clear ground rules, a reduction of the monthly stipend to 500 RM seems justified to run until the end of the contract. With this in mind the text of the attached letter seems reasonable.

To: Herr Rudolf von Laban, at present Plauen, Dobenaustrasse 127

Your letter to my section chief Cunz has come to my attention. As regrettable as it is that you are no longer able to meet your obligations as director of the still experimentally established “German Master Workshops for Dance” for health reasons, I am prepared to grant your wish and have entrusted my section chief with the new ordering of the direction of the Master Workshops during the course of the second semester (from October 1936 to 1 March 1937), which runs concurrently with the necessary management of the teaching personnel. Further steps to achieve this reorganization have already been undertaken as part of this task. Since you will not be in a position to take up your employment at the beginning of the Semester in October, a renegotiation of your contract of employment from that point in time will be in the interest of both parties. It is recognized that you will continue to act in a consultant and expert capacity for dance and to be still effectively active in the lay dance movement inspired by you. In consideration of the special circumstances, I regard a salary of 500 RM until the expiry of your contract as reasonable. Your advisory activity for that time period and with a view to your medically imposed convalescence will confine itself to reports and necessary adjudication, which you will carry out under instruction from my section chief in those places of convalescence, in which you find yourself.

Since the reorganization of the German Master Workshops, which I founded and which have been under my direction, has already begun, there remains a question to be settled whether it would not be appropriate to appoint a new chairman of the registered society [e.V., eingetragener Verein - JS]. In every other matter, which affects the transfer, I am, of course, during my stay in Berlin, entirely at your disposal.

Then there is a personal request: I have agreed to the reduction of my salary to 500 RM with retroactive effect from | October 1936. Since this proposal reached me on 10 November, it hit me very hard, because I face further not inconsiderable costs for my recuperation and in addition I have reckoned with certain costs of the transfer itself. I request therefore that the withholding of the amounts already paid to me be enacted from February 1937 and in installments.

With my best wishes,
Heil Hitler! (signed) Rudolf von Laban

Section VI
To Herr Section Chief IB, in house
21 November 1936
Now that Rudolf von Laban has withdrawn from the direction of the German Master Workshops for Dance, my section chief Cunz, to whom I have transferred the artistic and pedagogic control of policy, has already begun the job of reorientation of the teaching body. At the same time, the appointment of a new chairman of the registered society will be necessary. On grounds of unity of direction of the special tasks assigned to him, it seems most suitable if Herr Cunz himself takes over the chairmanship of the e.V. [eingetragener Verein, registered society - JS], which he is prepared to do without claiming any fee.

Since he belongs to Section VI, I request approval.

After investigation of your personal matters and conversations held with your representative, Herr Grohmann, I issue you a special authorization to exercise your profession revocable at any time. I urge you in your own interest not to make use of this right to perform in the period of validity granted by my decision in respect to performances, which have been promoted by an agency of the NSDAP the state or local authorities.

Note for the files: via Herr State Secretary
To the Herr Reich Minister Berlin, 24 February 1937
The dancer Alexander von Swaine, who is of English origin on his father’s side, enjoys a reputation well beyond our borders. Over a year ago he was sentenced by judgment of the Berlin magistrate’s court to eight months prison sentence for a crime that violates paragraph 175, No. 47 of the Reich Penal Code. As a result he has been permanently deprived of his right to be allowed to appear in public performances even in respect of his extraordinary artistic ability. If this embarrassing affair is once more presented to Herr Reich Minister, it is being done because certain mitigating circumstances, which led the authorities to commute the remaining half of the sentence by a parole under conditions of good behavior to 30 September 1938, have made a personal decision of the president of the Reich Culture Chamber seem prudent. The dancer von Swaine has achieved enormous success abroad in partnership with Alice Uhlen. He has always been extremely devoted to his father to whom he paid half of his fees. In the conviction he was found guilty of two minor offences, which were completely outside his relationship with professional comrades and the artistic community. In the case of the second personality, the man had a record and came from the streets and had nothing to do with the stage or the circles, in which von Swaine otherwise lives and works. The possibility exists that the exclusion of a world famous dancer from the Professional Association for Dance (Fachschaft Tanz) might be exploited outside our borders to make “something big” out of the matter. For that reason the competent department in agreement with Section 1B of the Ministry do not feel entitled by themselves to make the final decision. The relevant official charged with a close examination of the case has suggested to the Herr Minister that the period of good behavior scheduled to run to 30 September be made coterminous with further membership in the Professional Association. This course seems advisable because von Swaine has shown himself to be full of remorse, which naturally does not in any way mitigate the revolting character of the entire affair.

The Minister has decided that the application of 11.1. this year by the Professional Section [Fachschaft in the original - JS] Theater, Professional Group 5 in the Reich Theater Chamber for the expulsion of von S. is to be withdrawn. The further instruction of the Minister to make clear to von S. that this act of grace is conditional and a special exception and that any further events or indeed any appearance in homosexual circles will be certain to have grave consequences, for which no grace can be expected has been carried out personally on the 23rd of this month by me personally.

I am, like my siblings, Isadora (Dec. 1927), Augustin, and Raymond Duncan, Aryan on the side of both parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents, in fact, of Scottish, Norwegian, and Irish ancestry. On my father's side, we are descended from the Scottish Protestant Clan Duncan (in the vicinity of Dundee, Scotland). Our great-grandfather on my father's side, General William Duncan, fought in the American Revolutionary Wars against the British in 1775, as a member of the branch of the family who emigrated and settled in Philadelphia. My grandfather also lived there, whose wife, and the grandmother of my siblings and me, was a "Biron" by birth and of Norwegian Aryan descent. Our father Joseph Duncan was a businessman and banker who went west to California where he met my mother.

On my maternal side, we are descended from two prosperous Irish Catholic families, the "Grays" and the "Gormans." In 1819, these families arrived on various ships in the United States. Our maternal grandparents, Captain Thomas Gray and Mary Gorman, were married in St. Louis on 24 November 1829. My grandfather took part with the famous men, Fremont and Benton, in the opening of the West. He took part as a Colonel in the Civil War from beginning to end. Our mother was born in Little Mound on 26 January 1849, and was baptized by Bishop Peter Richard Kendrick. She went with her parents to California where she met and married our father. My siblings and I are the children of this marriage.

Besides my passport, I have no residence documents because such documents were not required at the time. All other family papers were destroyed in the San Francisco earthquake.

To Rolf Cunz, Reich Ministry for Propaganda and Culture, 11 May 1937

My dear Herr Cunz, I should have preferred to say personally what I would like to write to you today. Unfortunately, I had no time for a direct conversation in Berlin. I have been given the honor of working as director for the artistic conception and production of a set of choral movement scenes as part of a great festival in Munich. The engagement is an even greater honor because the occasion is planned in homage to the Führer. The event is planned for July 16th to 18th and is to be performed before the Führer during the "German Art Day" at the Royal Square in Munich. The engagement was offered to me by the publicity section of "German Art Day" (Gauleitung Munich, Upper Bavaria). I report this to you now because the work on such a project may affect my ability to do my teaching in the Master Workshops and indeed might make it necessary for me to ask for leave. However, I may regret that, I know—and I am sure you are one with me in this view—that every other task must give way before such an engagement.

In addition, I have been authorized to collect the best and most suitable dancers from all over Germany for the performance. I should very much welcome your advice and support in that effort. On my next visit to Berlin, I hope to be able to give you more details in a direct conversation. Until then, I am with "Heil Hitler!" Yours (signed) Mary Wigman (handwritten: (...) remark illegible)

Presented to Herr Minister
Re: visit of Frau Mary Wigman

Frau Wigman is living in Dresden and has her dance school there. She is convinced that Dresden is artistically a dying city and will under all circumstances transfer her school to Berlin. Frau W. believes that she has a great deal to offer in this field but has not, in the last few years, been able to break out of the Dresden circle of influence. She is convinced that, as a leading personality of the New German Dance, she belongs in Berlin.

Frau W. repeats again and again that this is not a matter of her personal interests. She has today such a large international reputation that she has no reason to worry about her own personal standing. On the contrary, she now sees her principal task as training the next generation of dancers, a field in which, in her view, great "confusion" reigns. She wishes to devote herself to this task in the Master Workshops in Berlin.

Frau W. complains that in Dresden she has frequently been accused of "internationalism." Of course, she draws pupils from the four corners of the earth; that is a great advantage of her school. In spite of that, she has always felt herself to be German. As a result of the Jewish boycott, she has told her manager that she stands for Germany, and since that time, she has been fully boycotted abroad, and a large, lucrative Japanese contract was annulled.

Frau W. has a house in Dresden, which she converted essentially for professional uses with studios, dress rooms, etc. The only thing in the way of her transfer to Berlin is the fact that she cannot sell the house, in which she has invested a great deal of money. She offers the house for an approximate value of 60-65,000 Reichmarks as a rest home or a mothers' home or something similar. If that were feasible, she would resettle in Berlin at once and devote herself to her task there.

Document 57 (BUNDESARCHIV 50. The President of the Reich Theater Chamber
To Frau Mary Wigman
Dear Frau Wigman,

On the suggestion of Herr Dr. Brandt of the Reich Chancellery, you applied to the Reich Propaganda Ministry for an official view on the problem of your Dresden dance school. In the name of the Herr Reich Minister and in my capacity as president of the Reich Theater Chamber, I have been authorized to communicate to you in regard to the aforementioned matter the following:

I am fully apprised of the fact that you have much to offer to the rising young talent in the sphere of modern art dance, which can at present be best conveyed by your participation as a guest instructor at the masters course in the German Master Workshops in Dance.

However, the transfer of your well-established school in Dresden to Berlin is not considered desirable, and in the foreseeable future, it cannot be carried out. The existing centers of culture in the German Gaus of the National-Socialist State are by no means going to "die out" so that the planned transfer of the Wigman School from Dresden to Berlin is both uncalled for and superfluous.

Heil Hitler!
(signed) Schlosser The following text has been cleaned up and separated wrongly appended words. Numbered headers and footers have been removed. The text is as follows:

I have, therefore, gladly acceded to the request of my relevant administrator Herr Cunz, to invite you to participate for the summer semester of 1937 in a corresponding capacity in a course of modern dance technique to run alongside that in classical technique offered by Miss Rauser, and to consider your cooperation within the scheme of construction, inasmuch as necessary, which the aforesaid administrator may undertake.

In the promotion of new dance talent today, the “confusion” that reigns applies unquestionably to the large number of mutually hostile private dance and ballet schools. For a considerable time, a freeze has been introduced until such time a clarification of the unhealthy situation has been accomplished. As part of that clarification, the Master Workshops were specifically conceived, which by summoning experienced and balanced personalities to the project, will help to carry out the process of regulation of the field.

Documentary Appendix 273

If, on these grounds alone, a transfer of your school with its strong roots in Dresden to Berlin in the near future cannot be contemplated, it would be a regrettable misunderstanding of the cultural tasks awaiting the culture centers in the German Gaus. The existing great culture cities like Dresden should not under any circumstance be condemned “‘to die out” in National-Socialist Germany. On the contrary, all the factors working there and institutes must contribute to the new flowering of culture across the entire spectrum of the German arts. For this reason, I cannot approve the transfer of the Dresden Wigman School to Berlin but instead convey to you my wishes for a prosperous continuation of your work in Saxony’s capital.

The Reich Minister for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda

To The Professional Association “Dance” in the Reich Theater Chamber
Berlin, 7 October 1937

The application of Frau Marie Luise Lieschke, Plauen i.V. Dobenaustr. 127, must be rejected in view of the excess supply of unemployed, existing younger forces, who for the first time have to be occupied in the next few years. The blame lies with the overly hectic tempo of training for gymnastic and teachers of amateur dance. It is simply impossible to increase this number by allowing more schools to be opened.

There is the additional fact that Frau Lieschke, as the wife of a doctor with a big practice and a clinic, is not in any way obliged to be professionally active, while at the same time, literally dozens of unemployed younger persons with complete training are desperate for any sort of work in their field.

The same applies to the application of Rudolf von Laban, who in any case at the time of his final resignation last year from the German Master Workshops gave us to understand that he intended to devote himself to the visual arts, with which he had begun his career.

The present crisis about suitable professional training is much more acute in the field of art dance education than in amateur dance. It is unacceptable that through the granting of permission to elderly exponents of systems which are no longer desired, that the clarification now begun is to be endangered. The rule here must be the principle that only the most competent teaching personnel from the existing ranks of persons suitably qualified are to be selected according to the strictest possible criteria and no untenable concessions are to be made. I return the two files on the completion of the matter. The professional section for dance [Fachschaft — JS] in the Reich Theater Chamber is charged with finding a suitable form of words for 274 Marion Kant, a short factual explanation of the refusal given to the applicant. A copy of said letter is requested. By order, (signed) Keppler

Herr Ministerial Councilor Dr. Schlésser
Activity Report

In Spring 1936, a special unit "Dance" was established in Section VI, comparable in its work description to that of the unit Reich Stage Design. Without the possession of a useful instrumentarium, lively rebuilding work cannot proceed. In order to achieve a unified new order, the unit set itself the task of clearing up the mal-admin-istration of Laban both in budgetary aspects as in its neglect of the entire dance pro-gram. The German Master Workshops inherited from the previous regime proved to be necessary as a directly applicable tool but had to be entirely reorganized. There was no clearly designed work program, one which meets the cultural needs of today in our state. The master instructors, undecided among themselves, wandered about without clear objectives. And we are talking about disproportionately high honoraria. (For example, Laban got 1,250 RM, Palucca 900 RM, while their assistants mainly had to do the work in their place).

The new order began by eliminating untenable leading figures and the cleaning up of the uneconomic elements in the management and administration. In place of the exploitation system, a system of payment contained in healthy limits was introduced and based on character and amount of the work to be recompensed. The title "master" awarded to privileged dancers, which in the Laban system could be acquired by attending the Institute, was dropped, because only the Reich Minister for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda had the right to award it. Instead, the main objects of the activity of the workshops remain the practical training of new blood for those future leading figures as ballet master (dance directors) and the directors of dance pedagogic training institutes (dance masters).

In future, such students will be expected to display total capability and knowledge in both classical and modern dance, mastery of all forms of national and character dance known to us, and proven capacity for responsible direction of a stage or chamber dance group in their future professional careers. If they display strength of talent in the direction of acro-batics and artistic dance for operatic stage work or small stage performance, such skills can be added. The foundations for ideological and political reliability will be established among the persons who later join boards of directors in the field of dance.

To this end, after mature reflection and the necessary preparation, a work schedule has been set out for the winter semester 1937/1938, which is not a pedantically fixed hourly schedule but is flexible enough to be continually augmented.

The afternoons will be kept free for movement choreography, racial and inheritance science, and guest courses.

The bewildering array of teaching methods from often contradictory and opposing training studios and elementary schools, in which the oldest and the newest methods compete in a harmful way, make it even more important that there be one central workshop in this field. Attendance must be obligatory for the above-mentioned reasons for all prospective ballet and dance masters.

The "German Dance Theater" can function as a healthy transitional stage for the master classes since intermediate pupils often trained in one-sided and partial systems can have completed their courses, but still have serious gaps in their preparation. Practical and theoretical classes at the "Dance Theater" can compensate for these omissions. The "Dance Theater" can also serve to support unemployed dancers by offering classical and modern training as well as group work, so that they maintain fitness and can be quickly brought together in a central place for special performances.

Since employed dancers from stage and teaching are also likely to train there, over time there will be a technical equalization of practice, which must benefit the entire world of dance and has already led to notable results in artistic achievement.

The great range of tasks of the Dance Theater and Master Workshops, which are to be responsibly directed by the most experienced and best experts from the various fields of dance, can only be comprehensively and definitively carried out if the requirements of art dance, that is, the higher interests of professional dancers at "The German Dance Theater" (and of course way beyond them to the discerning representatives of folk dance circles and the gradually reorganizing movement for amateur dance in "The German Dance Community Inc.") are made at home under one roof.

The need for purpose-built studios and a roomy building must be beyond question if the constructive work in German creative dance is to succeed over the many years envisaged. Without an orderly house of German Dance, a fruitful development will be made more difficult, if not indeed condemned to disintegration of the forces which, united, are doubly effective.

I respectfully request that I be given the support in the coming years to complete the task begun so promisingly. (signed) Cunz

Reich Theater Chamber, deputy managing director
To The President of the RThCh, Ministerial Councilor Dr. Rainer Schlosser, Berlin, 26 October 1937
Dear Herr President!

In view of your personal union as head of Section VI in the RMPopEnIPro and president of the Reich Theater Chamber, I take the liberty of submitting a letter that your desk officer Herr Cunz dictated to the professional section dance [Fachschaft —JS] in the Reich Theater Chamber and has been signed by Herr Regierungsrat Keppler. I must begin by drawing your attention to the fact that, by explicit direction of the Herr Minister for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda and president of the Reich Culture Chamber, correspondence may not go over the head of the relevant Culture Chamber, in this case the Reich Theater Chamber, and that no direct exchange of letters may take place with the individual professional sections of the RThCh. This is particularly applicable in the present case since the provision of certificates of competence to perform is an act of high sovereignty, which can only be carried out by the President of the Reich Theater Chamber directly and which Professional Sections are not entitled to undertake.

With regard to substance, I note that certificates of competence to perform are issued in precisely the same way in the field of dance as those issued to theatrical managers. The Reich Theater Chamber decides the issue after listening to the profession section dance and soliciting the opinions of individual members of the Advisory Board. I shall raise the cases of Lieschke and Laban precisely in that venue because the grounds outlined in the letter of 7 October 1937 give me no cause to refuse the certificates. I respectfully draw your attention to the executive orders No. 47 and 48 of 4 October and 18 July respectively. On the basis of these executive orders, I see no possibility of recognizing the grounds cited in the letter of 7 October 1937 as nearly sufficient to justify a refusal of the certificates.

Of course, if you, honored Herr Doktor, as president of the Reich Theater Chamber, have received an explicit instruction from the Reich Minister for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda to overrule the criteria in the executive orders 47 and 48 in the cases of Lieschke and Laban and to issue special prohibitions, that is quite another matter. I urge you respectfully not to apply special regulations in these cases because we are dealing here with two personalities who enjoy an excellent reputation in the dance field among a very wide public. It will not be understood in that public why these two outstanding figures are banned while lesser known individuals receive permission to perform without hesitation merely after being heard by Herr Desk Officer Cunz. Heil Hitler! (signed) L. Kérner

Re: Film Die Fledermaus

With reference to the letter from your office of 13 October instant, ... the following is communicated: Section III carried out exhaustive investigations in order to clear up the complaint. The result of these investigations is that the Jewish pianist Leo Stein was not active as a pianist for dance rehearsal in the film Die Fledermaus but in the film Das grosse Abenteuer of Ciné-Allianz. From the submissions provided by the ballet mistress Sabine Ress it is abundantly clear that the pianist Leo Stein was engaged as a substitute for two hours at a dance rehearsal for the film Das grosse Abenteuer because allegedly no other pianist was available. The engagement of this Jewish pianist took place directly by Sabine 278 Marion Kant Ress who also arranged payment of his honorarium. The company knew nothing of the matter because the ballet master or mistress normally arranges the casual employment of rehearsal pianists directly. On the other hand, it cannot be tolerated that Herr Tietz, who holds the responsibility for stage verification of dancers, waited for two and a half months after the Jewish pianist had worked at the dance rehearsal to inform us by report. In the annex, we respectfully submit the matter for decision. Heil Hitler!

I wanted to inform you about the present state of the Palucca business, which seemed important in view of her forthcoming guest appearances, especially the Berlin appear- ance on the evening of the 27th of January. | am bringing you up to date now in writing. Frau Palucca received a letter from the Reich Ministry for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda, dated 23 December 1937 in which Herr Cunz wrote officially as 280 Marion Kant follows: “The limitations on the activity of Frau Palucca do not extend, as previously thought, to the presentation of certain evenings in theaters. Her agent may therefore arrange such contracts. Frau Palucca is only limited in her appearance to the extent that she may not participate in performances of the Party, the State or its Agencies.” Since the restoration of the ministerial special permission is certainly not known to the press and since, in addition, a great deal rests on that, I urge you warmly to inform the press correspondingly and, something undoubtedly necessary, to say a word about it in the Reich press conference. If any uncertainties remain, do drop me a line or call me on the telephone. I am ready to come to Berlin at any time if you would like to talk to me or have me talk to other offices. | assume that now, when Frau Palucca may once again appear in state and municipal theaters as in the recent the- atrical season, the press will once again take up its previous attitude to the appear- ances of Frau Palucca.

In the letter that Grohmann cites that I signed, dated 23 December 1937, the issue is only that which affects private dance evenings arranged by her intermediaries. There is no lack of clarity here, which Herr von Loebell of the Reich Theater Chamber can confirm. The dancer may not be engaged by intendants or theater managers at the state theatrical enterprise and may only by private contract appear on such stages. To complete the precise definition of my official position, I ought to add that no new pupils may be admitted to the Dresden school.

Berlin, 3 February 1938
Re: Tcherepnin's Trepak

There are no objections to Tcherepnin's ballet music, which in any case has become well known through concert performances. The unprepared listener may get a few slaps on the ear from occasional unexpected harshness in the harmony, obstinate rhythms, and drum passages. But these moments will recede into the background during stage performances. In general, the listener senses the composer's intention throughout to write simply and melodically and to set folk melodies without distortion. The individual sections, of which two require the chorus to participate, can certainly stir the imagination of a choreographer and achieve great intensity of dance through the motor of a powerful crescendo.

In principle, I ought to make clear at this point that our theater should not content itself only with foreign and especially Russian ballet music but should consider German pieces as well. (signed) Dr. Roeder

The above assessment is shared in principle but I should like to propose that the libretto be examined by the Reich Dramaturge. There are elements in it that are not entirely uncontentious, which in any event do not exclude a perhaps false antimilitarist interpretation. (Signed) Mayer

284 Marion Kant RMPEP Dr. Lange To Intendant, Duisburg Opera, 15 February 1938

I have no objection to the performance of the ballet Trepak by Tcherepnin, which I return herewith, but would draw your attention to the many fine ballet compositions of our German composers, which would be preferable in my opinion to Russian ones. I ask the stage direction to take great care that a perhaps misunderstood antimilitaristic interpretation of Scene | be avoided. Heil Hitler!

“Report on the Gala Dance Evening of Harald Kreutzberg in Amsterdam”

Although the time available for successful publicity for the event was unusually short, the surprisingly good attendance at the evening must be regarded as the most important and essential matter to report. As expected, the public for the dance evening was composed very differently than that, for example, of the recent performance of the Valkyrie. Naturally the public professionally interested in dance — dance teachers, students at the conservatory, etc. — made up the majority. Happily a number of our conationals [“Volksgenossen” - JS] took advantage of the special concessions for members of our colony (many with free tickets). The offerings by Kreutzberg, which were world class, were suitably valued and praised by the entire Dutch press. The critics were unanimous in their view that Kreutzberg is at present the world's greatest dancer. Especially noteworthy was the fact that among the floral tributes presented to Kreutzberg the one bearing the sash of the Colony with the swastika was prominently displayed. The exceptionally discrete but emphatic emphasis on the German character of the evening was well received by those who attended (with the exception of the many Jews). A highly successful bit of propaganda. After the brilliant Valkyrie, this performance was culturally and propagandistic ally considered, since it involved an entirely different public, a full success. A limited number of free tickets were made available to me, which I gave to section leaders. In addition, members of the German Colony could purchase tickets at a reduced price, a concession granted by Herr Krause, by showing their red Colony identification card. Many members of the Colony took advantage of the concession and this led to the very satisfactory attendance at the event. Amsterdam, 14 December 1939. Document 74 (BUNDESARCHIV R 55 167) RMPEP.

I should be extraordinarily grateful for fifteen minutes of your time to report on them verbally. When some time ago I outlined my plans to you, you told me that you intended to register the German Dance Theater as a militarily essential enterprise. In the last few days I learned from Major Titel on whom I called to settle some issues about conscription that he knew nothing about any such application and urged me to ask you for one. Not merely issues about conscription but all sorts of small matters, the acquisition of small pieces of equipment for instruction (Swedish ladders, acrobatics material, etc.), the installation of a telephone switchboard in the building, all require a certificate with respect to militarily essential status. Since the German Dance Theater will not only be expected to meet artistic demands during wartime in the Greater German Reich but also will be required to carry out some important cultural-political tasks through tours in the neutral states, the justification for the designation as essential for the war effort is given. I should be most extraordinarily grateful to you, honored Herr Ministerial Director, if you would deal with this issue as quickly as possible, so that I can continue this beautiful work without interruption.

Under the rubric “dance dramas” certain tendencies have become evident to revive the abortive artistic developments of the period after the First World War. Such performances reveal an outspokenly intellectual impact, which is incompatible with the nature of ballet in the narrow sense and with dance in the more general sense. Cultivation of stage dance within the framework of theater does not require any obligation to give it a “philosophy of the dancing limb” or “an intellectual framework.” It is an error to believe that such an airy, in reality largely hideous essence, which within a small circle is regarded as the “soul of dance,” corresponds in its excessive experimentalism to the wishes of the public. The public has a justifiable claim that dance evenings be presented uniformly in the solid traditions of ballet, which should remain characteristic for all German stages. The musical repertoire for such works is so inexhaustible that it is unnecessary to have recourse to symphonies and the like. The indicated avoidance of the fundamental element of all dance activ- ity, which ought to be the cheeriest and most full of life of all theatrical categories, is not acceptable. In future, all such experiments are herewith forbidden." Heil Hitler! (signed) Schlosser (handwritten) "agreed GT" - Gutterer 7 February.

Such views, in which the dying remnants of an individualistic mode of dance and a specialized aestheticism still make themselves felt, are to be resisted. The healthy development of ballet in the new Germany has already absorbed the useful elements of the new dance movements and is based on the three fundamental aspects and training subjects: classical (point), national dance forms, and new artistic dance (expressive movement). These should not exclude each other as contradictory but grow closer in mutual augmentation. Without restricting the physical possibilities, which nature creates for dance (which also includes pantomime), the emphasis and main task of dance must lie in the presentation of cheerful, buoyant bodily feelings. Burdens of philosophical abstractions, interpretations of heavy symphonic music not originally written for dance or presentation of dramatic complexes, which without the spoken word or thorough study remain incomprehensible in every case, lead away from the road of a healthy development and can at best, insofar as strong cultural powers are behind them, be seen as limiting cases or transitional forms but not as the real meaning and purpose of the cultivation of the art.

Werner Egk, Leader, Professional Group of Composers in the Reich Music Chamber, Berlin Lochham, Post Grafling 15.9.1942
To Herr Ministerialdirigent Dr. Rainer Schlosser
Dear Herr Dr. Schlässler,
I am receiving letters from all sides, which inform me that a prohibition has been issued not by the management of the German Opera House but by the intervention of the Ministry, which covers all more or less narrative-based dance works. Contracts already signed have been nullified as a result and an extension of the prohibition to all 296 Marion Kant German theaters is in principle apparently being planned. I am extremely disquieted by these reports. Such a prohibition has no precedent and would amount to the extinguishing of an entire branch of art by administrative decree. It would further mean the appropriation without compensation of the work of German composers in a manner that cannot claim the most minimal justification by wartime needs or other military necessities.
I should be most exceptionally grateful if you would be good enough to let me know as soon as possible if the reports reaching me are true or not or whether they are simply groundless rumors. It would of course be just as unfortunate if prevention of performances of works in the above mentioned category were to occur by other, however imposed, measures not necessarily involving a ministerial decree. In addition, I should be glad of the opportunity to be allowed to talk to you in person and hope that a suitable occasion will present itself during my next visit to Berlin end of October or early November. Heil Hitler! As always, yours (signed) Werner Egk

Section T, Desk Officer Lange Berlin, 22 September 1942
To Herr Minister (handwritten: Gt. 22 September)
Ref: Ballet Problem
As directed, the German Opera House in Berlin, various theaters in the Reich, as well as composers, librettists and publishers were officially informed about the new directives with respect to cultivation of ballet. It was there brought clearly to their attention that in future in ballet seasonal repertoires dramatic and ideal elements were not to be transformed into ballet material. The best program of ballet performances in recent years in Berlin was the dance series Dance around the World. A ballet program ought therefore to present tap dance, Krakowiak, Polka, waltz, Czardas, Cancan, Alpine clog dancing, and Bavarian Wetsch dances, in other words, folk and historical dances, which can, of course, be stylized and cultivated. All in all: the absolute dance, dance as such, in which the audience rejoices in rhythm and movement, color and beauty, and in which no sort of intellectual involvement is required, is the type of dance to be encouraged.

It is my duty to report that_almost without exception very grave objections have been raised against this instruction, which in part derive from the historical evolution of modern ballet and in part from artistic considerations of principle; alternatively arguments that consider the cultural-political consequences of the radical abolition of "dramatic ballet," which has grown up in a century-long development, have been advanced. The following text is OCRed from a book. Please clean it up, removing extraneous characters and separating wrongly appended words. Whenever you encounter a number, verify if it is part of a header or footer, showing a page number. These must be removed. Important: do not continue unfinished sentences. Reply ONLY with the corrected text:

Choreographers, dance librettists, and composers point out, not entirely without justification, that dance has always had actions that require the evocation of meaning. Various great classical figures have composed dramatic ballets: Gluck, Mozart, Beethoven (Les petits riens, The Creatures of Prometheus and The Ruins of Athens), which the Rome ballet performed in Berlin recently on their guest appearance with great success. In modern times, the dramatic ballet received a new lease on life through the development of Russian ballet in the Imperial Maryinsky Theater. Here too, dance was absolutely conceived as portrayal of character and dramatic expression. The Russian ballet called on the talents of the most significant Russian composers: Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Glazunov, Stravinsky wrote works for the Russian ballet: Le sacre du printemps, The Fire Bird, Petrushka and Pulcinella, and Richard Strauss’ Joseph Legend.

Alongside the ballet of dramatic plot, which evolved consequentially over a long period and which at its best and most effective came close to the old forms of mime, there began to emerge in the last four decades a sort of absolute dance, which rather like contemporary absolute music, rejects all obvious, logically binding contents and pursues more or less "expressionist" goals. Such goals could hardly ever be entirely attained and as a consequence, some extremely questionable results followed.

Over and over it was pointed out that the rejection of dramatic dance must actually have been intended as a replacement of absolute dance, and the question was raised whether there was a misidentification of dramatic dance with absolute dance, because purely technically it is impossible to imagine a season's program without dramatic dance.

What the present directive now requires, that is, dance series of the type of Dance around the World, really falls into the category of what in expert circles is known as "Divertissement" [a particular kind of musical form — JS]. The most successful examples of this type of dance sequences are The Fairy Puppets by Bayer and The Toy Shop by Respighi. Yet even with these successful dance scenarios, composed by extremely strong melodists, one cannot attribute the effect entirely to melody and absolute dance; rather one embeds the series of more or less picturesque individual dances in a framework of plot, which gives to the whole greater popularity and approachability.

It seems to me that the argument is not entirely groundless that a simple, as it were, anecdotal plot will allow stage dancing to get nearer to the people and increase comprehensibility. It would be all too easy to let the advocates of intellectualized, overly refined, absolute and expressionistic dance creep back under the cover of the plotless divertissement.

The most famous ballet leaders and choreographers who work practically on the stage, for example, Pino Mlakar at the Munich State Opera or Rudolf Kolling at the German Opera House, Berlin, reject very firmly abstract expressionistic dance. Ballets with dramatic plot are shaped and staged by such ballet directors and choreographers in a discrete manner, which places the purely dance element in the foreground without intellectual dilution. Stopping ballets with dramatic plots would constitute a grievous interference in the program plans of theaters and publishers, quite apart from damage done to several renowned composers, such as Richard Strauss (Joseph Legend), Werner Egk (Joan of Zarissa), Casella (The Big Jug) etc. At the time when the new directive was issued, the German Opera House, Berlin, had just accepted "The Lamenting Song," a musically valuable work by Kurt Heuser, bandmaster in the Berlin Folk Theater, which derives its plot from a German fairy-tale. I have allowed myself to pose the question whether, while strongly encouraging the divertissement and the dance suite, it might not be prudent to continue silently to tolerate at the same time the classical ballets of Gluck, Mozart, Beethoven, Richard Strauss and other important contemporaries because of the balletic and musical delights contained in such works.

I am sure that I am not wrong in the assumption that it was never your intention in the issuing of the directive about cultivation of new ballet to eradicate those long-standing, stable parts, as it were, the classical components of the ballet repertoire nor those contemporary ballets that can be defended on aesthetic grounds.

Heil Hitler! (signed) Schlosser [underlined by the Minister’s Private Office - MK]. Document 91 (BUNDESARCHIV 50.01 238/1) Director T To Herr Johannson 25 September 1942

On 24 September, the Herr Minister approved the measures taken by this department in the sense indicated in the submission of 21 September with respect to the ballet problem. In order to prevent the individual theater directors [from] triumphing too obviously, and in addition, to prevent the whole intellectual “Grandma’s footsteps” at the German Opera from starting all over again, it is essential to emphasize that dance divertissements like "Dance around the World" or the dance series presently in rehearsal at the German Opera House are and will remain the vehicle preferred and fostered by this Ministry, whereas our love of narrative-based works remains platonic at best.

In the foreseeable future a circular based on this minute and the submission of 21 September will have to go out, which will clarify the matter again. It might be sensible to have the opinions of Diirr and Dr. Lange. I shall also touch on this terrain in my speeches in coming months.

If narrative-based ballets are to be tolerated, then only the tried and tested ones like Gluck’s "Don Juan" or "Fairy Doll." If new ones are written, they can be accepted and rehearsed with the exception of the German Opera House where we must await events. Of course, we will not rejoice, or even appear benevolent, at the acceptance of such compositions.

With respect to new creations, the rule must be that they present and prove themselves. For example, a dance series based on "Max und Moritz" could be made, because every German knows the cartoons (although one has to ask why beautiful people should dress up in scurrilous and ugly costumes, but the example "Max and Moritz" merely serves to show that the narrative-based plots to be converted into a ballet should be the common property of the public). One can dance "Cinderella." One can choreograph a dance from "The Life of a Do-Nothing," although this work has not got the same size of public. A wandering journeyman, who passes a customs house in the 1820s, experiences the marching out of the customs officers, the lifting of the barrier at the frontier, and then wanders through field and forest and eventually tramps through Italy, will not be easily understood without knowledge of Eichendorff. Much greater reserve must be applied to newly conceived fairy-tales, as here especially easily extravagance and symbolic mystification can creep into the material. Heil Hitler! (signed) Schlosser

RMPEP Section Theater, Resp. Officer Johannson
To Director T
Berlin, 7 December 1942
(Minute for the Files)

Yesterday morning I attended a dance matinee in the Folk Theater, presented by Sybille Banzhaff, solo dancer in Brunswig and Marianne Vogelsang, Ballet Mistress in Gottingen. Both the programs’ layout and the dances presented have caused me to make you the following report:

I had the misfortune to miss a note in the program until the intermission. Piece no 2, an Andante of Bach had been cancelled, so I guessed continually wrongly as I tried to follow the pieces but had the satisfaction of observing that my neighbors to right and left were equally at sea, one constantly ahead and one behind the actual performance.

Vogelsang is certainly an impressive dancer who apparently made a name for herself five years ago in Berlin and is supposed to have danced for the Führer. The titles of individual dances were quite frankly unacceptable. What was I to understand from a piece entitled Cradle Song for the Hanged? It would have been better to title it “Cradle Song for a Miscarriage,” which might be offered to us tomorrow in some program. The day after tomorrow we might see “Matricide” or “The Remorse of a black-market cattle Slaughterer” etc.

A gypsy dance, danced to one of Brahms’s Hungarian Dances, followed. German dances from Schubert were selected to sombre, particularly dark dances and were presented in minor keys and tearfully. Since Vogelsang is a deep dancer [Tieftanzerin - JS], the image presented was completely distorted.

Banzhaff danced at the beginning three pieces under the title Figure in the storms of their times:

1. Death of the rococo to music by Beethoven;
2. Borgia, a dance in which she tried to embody the glitter and corruption of the Renaissance;
3. And tomorrow I shall be alone, which went beyond all limits. She stood on the stage in a simple day dress and portrayed the farewell of a young woman or wife, who suffers in her imagination the loneliness and imagines her absent lover in a thousand dangers. Conclusion: complete collapse on the stage.

This style of dance contradicts, I believe, our views. If I compare the dance evening with what I saw at the German Opera House on Friday night, I have the feeling that I am comparing 1942 and 1932 on the stage. The spirit of the Folk Theater celebrates joyous rebirth. Lichtenberg once said about some of his conversation partners, “had they been books, I would not have read them.” Here we might alter that to “had they been drama, we would have forbidden them.”

Just as we refuse to allow pianists to play cultural Bolshevik music, be it Berg, Krenek or Hindemith, about whose abilities we have no doubt, so we ought not to allow a dancer these days, just from the titles alone, to present a dance evening of that type.

The German Dance School, housed in Berlin-Dahlem, Ruhlandalle 31, has been completely bombed out as a result of the air-raid in the night 1-2 March 1943. Only a few pieces of equipment could be saved. The damage suffered according to a preliminary estimate amounts to 356,428 RM. Until further notice the Dance School has been transferred to temporary quarters in the House of German Sport (Reich Sport Field). Immediate procurement of replacement for the destroyed equipment can only be carried out when the Dance School has been offered suitable accommodation by the Main Planning Office, City of Berlin. As soon as that occurs, the relevant funds for replacement will be requested. This is sent for your information.

1. All theaters supported by public funds, all private theaters, variety clubs, cabarets, traveling companies, and concert agencies as well as the majority of all orchestras, art and book publishers, are to be closed. The Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War, Reich Minister Dr. Goebbels, has empowered and instructed the presidents of the individual chambers to effect the closures in their respective sectors of competence. In principle steps are to be taken to ensure that personnel freed by such measures are consigned to the labor offices.
2. As part of this decree all exemptions from military service in the cultural sphere are abolished.
3. Personnel removed from exempt status will be deployed by the labor offices within the framework of the employment criteria for labor deployment. The General Plenipotentiary for Labor Deployment will demand that purveyors of culture report at once to their respective labor offices.
4. A few personalities of exceptional importance in all spheres of cultural life will remain exempt from military or labor service. This relatively small number has been determined by the Ministry and approved by the minister. Individual directors of Reich Propaganda Offices may apply to me for special exemptions. Persons so designated as well as others declared essential, because they are required to carry out certain tasks in the cultural sector (a few orchestral publishers, etc. 1. The Reich Culture Chamber will issue certificates exempting certain individuals from labor deployment. These certificates will be recognized by all labor offices.
2. Regional directors of Propaganda Offices should help deploy creative personnel within the framework of total war, adhering to the following guidelines:
a. Deploy persons in cultural activity who have been working in cooperative organizations (theaters, orchestras, publishing houses) as a unit or in closed groups in new organizations.
b. Deploy persons not bound by cooperative work agreements individually according to their capacities.
c. Ensure that deployed personnel are employed in jobs that consider their subsequent return to their artistic activities.
d. Make the reason and necessity for labor deployment clear to those who have created their culture in cooperative organizations.
e. Transfer cooperative collectivities to armament making or other essential war work through local Reich Propaganda Office directors.
3. The Reich Culture Chamber will provide instructions and guelines for help in closures, compensatory hardship payments for culturally creative personnel, and the treatment of older artists no longer required for labor deployment.

Palucca, Dresden
To Herr Bade
17 September 1944

My dear Herr Bade,

From time to time, I have read short stories by you in newspapers, as I did yesterday evening, and then I am delighted and think that I should like to do what you do. Then, from time to time, I hear from acquaintances how you are getting on. In my case, a lot has changed. The last few months I had lots of really beautiful evenings, but that's all over now, and I work morning to night at home, without help and (...) quarters. In the evening, I try to train as much as I can, but it's no good. I am just waiting for my labor deployment. That's the way my life is.

And today, I come to you with a question. I have written the following lines to Berlin because Herr Adler begged me to do it. He can't go to the place because he has wound everything up, and so I have directed the letter to the Reich Culture Chamber. I wanted to ask if you knew any of the gentlemen who make up the list of dancers. Adler wrote me that Meudtner and Kreutzberg were on it. My case is naturally different, but in recent times, I have been able to work without disturbance and had such wonderful evenings. The people were so grateful and happy, and now everything is so hard, and if I could just have a few evenings, I could hold out and then I would have a goal and could find the strength.
