Dreamworlds and Catastrophe: The Passing of Mass Utopia in East and West

The idea of comparing their forms in East and West grew out of a period of close collaboration with Moscow philosophers. From 1988 to 1993, I was a frequent visitor at the Institute of Philosophy of the Soviet (later, Russian) Academy of Sciences, and worked together with a new generation of intellectuals who were critically analyzing Soviet culture as a system of power. In the course of this exchange, the Cold War world disintegrated. The imaginary topology of two irreconcilable enemies, ready and able to defend themselves by destroying life on this planet, dissipated with the abruptness of a disappearing dream. The historical rupture felt like sudden sanity.

For a time, the structures of power seemed to us so far in abeyance, and the burden of past history so light, that personal friendships alone would be strong enough to usher in a new, shared cultural era. But when new constellations of power began to coalesce and we found ourselves moving against the historical current, the limitations of personal agency became painfully apparent. Our collaboration was part of an intense period of newly allowed exchange between thinkers whose work had been held apart by the Cold War order.

The projects we helped initiate were the means through which various aspects of Western thought were introduced to the USSR and its successor states, including the first publication of Walter Benjamin in Russian, the first deconstruction workshop, the first Heidegger conference, the last Soviet International Film Festival, and the first and last course at the Dubrovnik Inter-University Centre to include members of what might be called the Continental School of Soviet philosophy, including its leading figure, Merab Mamardashvili. Jacques Derrida, Jiirgen Habermas, Fredric Jameson, Jean-Luc Nancy, Slavoj Zizek, and others all played a role in these exchanges, so that the story becomes part of the intellectual history of our time.

But hopes that we had for a transformation of political culture were not realized. Our project of establishing a common critical discourse was, and remains, marginal to the dominant intellectual trends of the post-Cold War era. In its place, the hegemonic discourse affirms the moral superiority of those who have been the victors in this century. There is little reflection on how many beliefs they shared with those whom they defeated.

Against the often-repeated story of the West's winning the Cold War and capitalism's historical triumph over socialism, these essays argue that the historical experiment of socialism was so deeply rooted in the Western modernizing tradition that its defeat cannot but place the whole Western narrative into question. If the term postmodern is operative here, it is not as the description of a new historical stage—the underlying structures of modernity have far from disappeared—but as the awareness that there are no stages of history in the developmental and optimistic sense that modernity's dreamworlds once believed. The book is divided into four parts. The first part, "Dreamworlds of Democracy," examines the political forms of East and West, revealing a contradictory relationship between democracy and sovereignty, originating in the French Revolution and culminating in the Cold War's logic of mutual annihilation. The second part, "Dreamworlds of History," critically examines the narrative of revolutionary time by telling the story of Bolshevik cultural politics in its terms, and suggests rethinking revolutionary politics without this temporal armature.

The third part, "Dreamworlds of Mass Culture," takes its lead from the artists in the late Soviet period who represented the dreamworld of Soviet culture at the moment of awakening from it, and juxtaposes mass culture images of East and West, making the struggle between these systems visible as a competition to excel in producing the same utopian forms. The fourth part, "Afterward," places the book in the historical context of the author's collaboration with Moscow philosophers, weaving together personal and political history in an attempt to demystify them both.

This book challenges the standard wisdom that capitalism is desirable and inevitable, the normal natural arrangement of social life. It rejects the neoliberal argument that the social evils of modernity are distortions caused by political interventions into market outcomes, whereby socialism and recently even the welfare state are lumped together with fascism as unhealthy deviations from the norm.

The Cold War discursive binary of totalitarianism versus democracy is challenged at its core. At a time when politics on the left as well as the right seems eager to jettison the whole conception of the masses, it cautions that every political and cultural struggle of the past century that called itself democratic was waged for a mass constituency, and in its name. At the same time, it questions whether democracy can ever be compatible with a concept of sovereignty based on violence, whether perpetrated by a single party in the name of the general will, or by a mass army in defense of the nation-state.

This book tells a story of similarities, interpreting cultural developments of the twentieth century within opposed political regimes as variations of a common theme, the utopian dream that industrial modernity could and would provide happiness for the masses. This dream has repeatedly turned into a nightmare, leading to catastrophes of war, exploitation, dictatorship, and technological destruction. To continue the same dream into the future, impervious to the ecological dangers, would be nothing less than suicidal. However, these catastrophic effects need to be criticized in the name of the democratic, utopian hope to which the dream gave expression, not as a rejection of it. A world organized by global capital in which industrial production continues to expand, but this time indifferent to the well-being of the masses and unfettered by political constraints, is not a world in which catastrophes will disappear.

1.1 Mass Sovereignty and the Image of the Enemy
From the perspective of the end of the twentieth century, the paradox seems irrefutable that political regimes claiming to rule in the name of the masses - claiming, that is, to be radically democratic - construct, legitimately, a terrain in which the exercise of power is out of control of the masses, veiled from public scrutiny, arbitrary and absolute. Modern sovereignties harbor a blind spot, a zone in which power is above the law and thus, at least potentially, a

1.2 Hypertext COLD WAR ENEMIES (See page 35 TEXT)
According to official history, the Cold War did not begin until the enunciation in 1947 of the Truman Doctrine to "contain" communism. Yet the structuring logic of its political imaginary was already in place by the end of World War 1.37 For the Western imaginary, the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 was an absolute threat from the very beginning. It challenged both SPACE as the determinant of sovereignty, and the SEPARATION BETWEEN THE ECONOMIC AND THE POLITICAL as discursive terrains. The whole notion of national defense became problematic. In the words of a U.S. General at the Paris Peace Conference: "It is true that you can prevent an army of Bolsheviks from coming out of Russia by posting on its borders a sufficiently large military force, but you cannot in this way prevent Bolshevism from coming out."38 Precisely because of this, the imaginary effects of Bolshevism within U.S. political discourse were hallucinatory in ways that became the hallmark of the Cold War. As the absolute enemy (because it did not behave as enemies should!), Bolshevism took on the fantastic image of a "fire," a "virus," a "flood" of barbarism, "spreading," "raging," "out of control," a "monster which seeks to devour civilized society" and destroy the "free world."39 The Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War that began in the winter of 19181919 had a specific meaning in this discursive context. By blockading the coastline and providing the White Russians with military supplies, it was an offensive measure that inscribed Bolshevism symbolically onto a geopolitical terrain, set off by territorial boundaries in an attempt to contain an idea—socialism—that had no respect for such boundaries.

When the Red Army launched its own offensive campaign against Poland, it seemed to confirm Bolshevik Russia as a belligerent nation-state, one that was potentially aggressive in a military sense. The territorialization of socialism as a spatial threat, which became a fundamental premise after World War II when the Cold War had its official beginnings, was thus already present as the ur-response of the capitalist nation-states to the success of the Bolshevik Revolution. Viewing opposition to capitalism as aggression by a foreign nation normalized the enemy. It followed from this logic that if communist regimes were willing to act like nations (as was the Soviet Union during the Popular Front era of the 1930s), then one could be at peace with them, and even (as in World War II) act with them in military alliance. In the United States, the Bolshevik Revolution produced a discourse of internal enemies as well. Known as the Red Scare, it equated the foreign threat of Bolshevism with all organized challenges to the war effort, of which there were many, whether from workers, socialists, pacifists, women, or African-Americans. The Espionage Act of 1918 made criticizing the armed forces, national flag, or military uniform punishable by twenty years' imprisonment. South European immigrants previously described as "racially unassimilatable" were now forced to kiss the flag to prove their loyalty as "100% American." "Radical aliens" were turned back at Ellis Island and denied immigration. The Postmaster General was given the power to remove both antiwar material and socialist papers from the mail. In 1919, when workers’ action in the textile and steel industries set off a chain reaction of 3,600 strikes involving four million workers (the general strike that many heralded or feared as the worldwide workers' revolution), immigrant organizers were branded as foreign agents of Bolshevism, and deported. Women's suffrage leaders, protesting against a war to protect "democracy" which all women were denied at home, were imprisoned as political subversives.

When the 200,000 African-Americans who had served in the war returned home to continued segregation, and racial demonstrations in many cities turned violent, this "negro subversion" was attributed to Bolshevik propaganda among the demonstrators. The U.S. Attorney General, A. Mitchell Palmer, ordered agents to infiltrate the ranks of the Left, authorizing a series of raids in which "police burst into homes and meeting places all over the country, loading ‘suspicious’ aliens onto trucks or marching them handcuffed through the streets. . . Over three thousand aliens were deported." Palmer's language had all the attributes of Cold War hysteria: "Like a prairie fire, the blaze of revolution is sweeping over every institution of law and order . . . eating its way into the homes of the American workmen . . . licking the altars of the churches. . . ." Political radicals were lumped together with prostitutes and lunatics as a potential threat, and were vulnerable to the new deportation laws. In short, to criticize in the name of democracy the existing economic and political structures of the United States was equated with being "un-American" in the sense of both an alien presence and a moral threat. The record in the Soviet Union is hardly more heartening, and the domestic body count was incomparably higher. The overt violence of the Civil War (1918–1921) claimed over a million lives. Arguably, this was a defensive war, waged against the "normal," class enemy of White Russians aided by capitalist nations. As Fitzpatrick notes, the Civil War "did not frighten the Bolsheviks and to some degree attracted them, since they sensed that only violent confrontation with the class enemy would guarantee a true revolutionary victory." [44] Nevertheless, the destruction was extreme, resulting in famine, industrial chaos, shattered cities, and dislocated populations. [45]

It should be noted that there is nothing about "normal" enemies that makes physical violence against them any less probable. On the contrary, because it is a legitimate, indeed heroic act, you kill normal enemies cheerfully. Against absolute enemies, whose physical disappearance would imperil one's own identity, the most violent attacks may be symbolic. The name "Cold War" refers precisely to the fact that by outlawing the enemy's interpretation of the world, the silencing violence was cultural even more than it was physical. [46]

Truly dangerous to the legitimacy of Bolshevik Party sovereignty in the early years was resistance within the working class and revolutionary movements themselves. Examples of such resistance were multiple, and the party did not hesitate to put them down by force, thereby exposing the non-identity between party sovereignty and popular-democratic rule. This was the case when in the early years the Workers' Opposition movement threatened to strike against the regime for better conditions, higher pay, and more workers’ control. [47] It was the case when in 1919 Lenin withdrew his support from Nestor Makhno's partisans fighting for Ukrainian independence, denouncing this popular, grass roots guerrilla resistance movement as "petty bourgeois counterrevolution." [48] It was clear in the suppression of a series of uprisings by peasants who, protesting against the compulsory grain requisitions of 1920–1921, adopted as their revolutionary slogan "Soviets without Bolsheviks." [49] And it was perhaps most shockingly the case when, in March 1921, the revolutionary workers and soldiers of the island commune of Kronstadt, which had championed the Bolshevik cause in the October Revolution, rose up against the Communist Party and declared their own radical socialist, "soviet" democracy. The Kronstadt communards were denounced as perpetrators of a "White-Guardist plot" and were brutally suppressed under Trotsky's order to "shoot them down like pheasants."50 During this time, the discourse of class enemies expressly excluded the workers of Europe and the (hypertext continued on next page) < previous page page_5 next page > file:///E|/-=%o20%CD%EO%F8%E8B%20%EF%F3%E1 %EB%...d%20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_5.html [21.01.2009 0:31:17] page_6 < previous page page_6 next page > Page 6 (which escapes the people's control) implies a circular logic, because the state as law defender is itself the constitutor of the law. As Walter Benjamin argued in the early 1920s, when the police are brought in to put down popular demonstrations such as workers' strikes or antiwar mobilizations, their purpose is to protect, not law, but the monopoly of the right to establish law. By the exercise of violence over those who challenge the existing law, the latter, writes Benjamin, "reaffirms itself. But in this very violence something rotten [Morsches] in the law is revealed," not its justice but its monopoly of the (violent, physical) power to determine, in the last analysis, what justice is.6 To summarize: The class nature of the state may explain its violence, but not its legitimacy; the democratic nature of the state may explain its legitimacy but not its violence. If one rejects the Marxist critique and attempts to redeem the violent state through liberal-democratic theory, appealing to the legality of popular sovereignty, one faces the problem that, (hypertext continued from previous page) United States.51" As for Western states, as agents of the bourgeois class they were the normal enemy. The more they fought the Bolshevik regime, the more legitimacy the latter could claim. More problematic to Bolshevik foreign policy were threats to its monopoly of the claim to be the agent of revolutionary progress.52 With the establishment of the Comintern in 1919, Communist parties throughout the world were to take their orders from Moscow—or risk falling into the category of absolute enemy. This centralization of power was proclaimed as indispensable for the international proletarian cause.53 Both within the Soviet Union and without, "normal" enemies could be tolerated according to the "ebb and flow" of the revolution's historical course.54 The New Economic Policy (NEP), initiated in March 1921, allowed nonproletarian elements—certain bourgeois elements, intellectuals, and officials—to coexist within revolutionary society. The period of NEP continued to be described by the party as a time of class struggle, but in a peaceful mode. Because peasants were a historically superseded class, it was possible to make an alliance (smychka) with them. Because history was on the side of socialism, competition between public and private sectors of the Soviet economy could be tolerated. By the mid-1920s, Bukharin spoke of the economic transformation as occurring bloodlessly, "without the clanging of metal weapons"; the Soviet Union would “outgrow the market"; the time of the Terror was over; class struggle was "dying out," replaced by competition between "semi-friends" and "semi- enemies."55 In the late 1920s, however, the slow tempo of history became intolerable. Declaring TIME itself the enemy, Stalin announced that as Soviet society progressed toward communism there would be "an inevitable intensification of class struggle."56 The policy of alliance with the peasantry was replaced by "dekulakization," the ruthless destruction of those peasants who had benefited materially from (hypertext continued on next page) < previous page page_6 next page > file:///E|/-=%o20%CD%EO%F8%E8B%20%EF%F3%E1 %EB%. In the case of the use of violence by popular sovereignty against a mass demonstration of popular will, it becomes questionable whether the law that the sovereign is upholding is itself legitimate. When democratic sovereignty confronts the people with all the violence that it monopolizes as the legitimate embodiment of the people, it is in fact attesting to its nonidentity with the people. Thus, the attempt to resolve the contradiction between popular sovereignty and state violence by recourse to the conception of the law becomes caught in a vicious circle. And the effect of this circularity is to undermine the very possibility of the legal/illegal distinction.

It may be necessary to take a different tack. If we concentrate on the origins of the state in a philosophical sense, then all of these elements, democracy, legitimacy, and the "wild zone" of absolute power, come together in a coherent configuration. This configuration creates an emblem under the sign of War—not the hidden war that the state covers up.

In a return to the discourse of the Civil War, force was justified in class terms: "The kulaks will not leave the historical stage without a struggle." Again, internal war was framed within the context of a threat from without. The war scare that began in 1927 made constant allusions to "encirclement" of the Soviet Union by imperialist powers. Internal class enemies charged as economic "wreckers" were accused of conspiring with imperialist powers as "spies." Even the peasants were seen as part of an international conspiracy. Stalin proclaimed in 1927: "We have internal enemies. We have external enemies. This, comrades, must not be forgotten for a single moment." The intensity of this war scare—the "almost hysterical alarm about immanent military attack by the capitalist powers"—was at the time unjustified. But total threat, domestic and foreign, legitimated total, extralegal power.

Reviving the imaginary of class war was a means of consolidating Stalin's own power. By interpreting the struggle to modernize as itself a war zone, Stalin placed the whole society under siege. The discourse of forced industrialization bristled with military terms: "shock brigades" of workers waged "battles of production"; goals and problems became "fortresses" to be "stormed"; collectivization was described as the "storming of the countryside"; Communists were "fighters," "mobilized" on the "grain front," the "planning front," the "literary front," and even the "philosophy front." In the words of one participant: "In the thirties we felt as if we were at war, at war with the entire world, and we believed that in war you should act like there's a war on."

Paradoxically, in the mid-1930s when terror against the enemy within reached its height, Soviet foreign policy sought an accommodation with the capitalist nation-state order, first, during the period of the Popular Front, as championing the cause against fascism, but then, suddenly, in alliance with fascism by the Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact of 1939. This alliance was justified within Soviet discourse as referring to Marx's argument, but the war that the state defines explicitly as its purpose, indeed as the very essence of its being. For it is the real possibility of war and the threat of a common enemy that constitute the state not merely as a legal entity but as a sovereign entity, the legitimate embodiment of the collective with the power to wage war in its name. As sovereign of the collective, it has sovereignty over the collective, with the right to order to their death the very citizens in whose name it rules. The wild zone is thus a war zone. The rightful power of the democratic sovereignty to wage war is the source of its legitimate claim to the monopoly of violence, and to the exercise of terror. This much Carl Schmitt saw clearly.

Throughout his life, during the Weimar Republic, during the Third Reich when he was briefly a member of the Nazi Party, and during the Cold War in a divided Germany, this professor of international law, whose writings experienced a renaissance in Europe in the 1980s, argued that Nazi Germany was a normal class enemy, just one among the capitalist nations that were destined historically to destroy each other. But when Hitler broke the pact and invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, World War II became the "great patriotic war," fought not by a class but by the "Soviet people" (led in heroism specifically by the Russians). Never was the Soviet Union more integrated into the Western discourse of nation-states than as a wartime ally against Hitler's military aggression.

The "people's democracies" that were constructed in Eastern Europe after Germany's defeat were described as nation-states, allied through a series of treaties with the Soviet Union rather than incorporated into its federation. This marked a transformation in the conceptual terrain.68 In the late 1940s, class war was articulated as a war about territory and its defense, an international struggle between the Eastern bloc and the nations of the West that were separated by a physical boundary to prevent "contagion" or "spillover" into the socialist camp.69 Soviet discourse became state-centered and defensive, aiming, at least in eastern Europe, at preserving the status quo against "capitalist restoration."70 It was also anticosmopolitan and anti-Semitic, privileging the Russian people as superior due to their special contribution to Soviet history.71 But in other, key ways, the discourse had not changed.

Soviet interventions into Hungary (1956) and Czechoslovakia (1968) were justified within the same logic of international class solidarity that had existed during the Russo-Polish War of 1920, defended as the necessary fulfillment of the Soviet Union's historic duty to protect socialist gains in these countries. Fascism was interpreted as a capitalist phenomenon in a way that exonerated East German Communists from guilt (while in the West, socialists and fascists were lumped together within a new discourse of "totalitarianism").72 Now, as earlier, sovereign independence meant independence from capitalism, and Soviet military intervention (hypertext continued on next page)<previous page page_8 next page>file:///E|/-=%o20%CD%EO%F8%E8B%20%EF%F3%E1%EB%...d%20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_8.html [21.01.2009 0:31:21] page_9 < previous page page 9 next page > Page 9 that the act of identifying the enemy is the act of sovereignty, indeed the political act par excellence. But I want to go a step further than Schmitt, which is also a step away from him, one that turns his justification of national sovereignty into its radical critique. To define the enemy is, simultaneously, to define the collective. Indeed: defining the enemy is the act that brings the collective into being. Now, when sovereignty claims to be democratic, the collective itself is alleged to act. The interests of the people are said to be immediately, transparently reflected in the sovereign agent, who therefore has absolute power. But the logical trick in this argument is that the collective of the "people" that supposedly constitutes the democratic sovereignty does not exist until that sovereignty is constituted. There is no collective until the "democratic" sovereign—precisely in the act of naming the common enemy—calls that collective into being. Subsequently, any popular challenges to the sovereign's legitimacy can be defined as enemy acts.

It follows (hypertext continued from previous page) was justified in terms of the special (monopoly) status of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as guardian of the future for the proletarian class.73 It should be noted that the discourse of enemies characteristic of the Cold War was not limited to the political realm. Striking on both sides is the degree to which these imaginaries were fostered in the popular imagination through mass culture. Science fiction was a favored form of demonization of the enemy. In the 1920s, the contrast of "communist heaven" and "capitalist hell" was a generic theme in Soviet science fiction, projecting onto the "other" all of the negative aspects of industrial society.74 After World War II, a whole series of U.S. catastrophe movies concerning "alien invaders" connected fear of Communism with these science fiction fantasies. As late as the 1980s, when an ex-movie star, U.S. President Ronald Reagan, spoke of the "evil empire" of Red Communists that ruled the Soviet Union, he drew on images deeply ingrained in the collective unconscious.75

FRENCH REVOLUTION (See page 31 TEXT) The French Revolution was "a society in search of a new collective identity" based on the democratic principle "that people are power, or that power is the people," implying a transparency, or identity, between the government and the governed.76 But what constellation of power could claim to be this impossible transparency?77 The struggle for power throughout the revolutionary period, from 1789 through 1795, was a "competition of discourses for the appropriation of legitimacy,"78 as each group tried to demonstrate that if represented the general will by defining the political discourse in a way that allowed it to seize the site of power from which the legitimation of sovereignty emanated.79 The historical effect of this process was the construction of a new machinery of power which, in the name of democracy, reestablished the absolutism that it meant to destroy. This is the argument made by the conservative historian Frangois Furet, whose influential study was written on the occasion of the French Revolution's bicentennial. We can put the matter more strongly. Given the logical trick in the construction of popular sovereignty, the exercise of violence, including terror, against the "enemy" (which, defined by the sovereign agency, may be within as well as without) paradoxically becomes the only proof of this agency's democratic legitimacy, that is, of its claim to be the people, for only "the people" would have the right to use violence in the democratic state. The real consequence of this trick in logic is that actual people find themselves confronting a wild zone of sovereign power.

Furet's critique of the democratic nation-state can be refunctioned against his conservative, antidemocratic intent. Crucial to our interests is his understanding of the seizure of the site of power within the imaginary discourse as being one with the construction of the enemy, the counterrevolutionary "other" that in turn defines the "people." This was true in the early stages of the Revolution, when the Abbé Sieyés excluded the whole order of the nobility from the "people" by arguing that "precisely what the citizens had in common" was "the will to found a nation in opposition to the nobility." It was true in the advanced stages of the Great Terror, when the imagined “aristocratic plot" became the embodiment of the "anti-principle of Revolution." And it was true during the revolutionary wars, when the aristocracy was accused of treason against the revolutionary "patriots" in collusion with foreign powers.

In all of these forms, the agents of the aristocratic plot were abstract, vague, and hidden, but, because "crushing the plot became a laudable and purifying act" synonymous with saving the Revolution, it became the act of sovereign legitimation to the point that "the Revolution had no objective limits, only enemies." This logic is the ur-form of the wild zone of democratic sovereign power.

I would like at this point to introduce the concept of the "political imaginary" (politicheskoe voobrazhaemoe) as it has been formulated by the Russian philosopher Valerii Podoroga and explicated in the work of his colleague Elena Petrovskaia. Similar terms abound in contemporary discourse. Laclau and Mouffe write about the "Jacobin imaginary." Castoriades speaks of the "social imaginary." And, of course, the stage of the "imaginary" is a fundamental category of Lacanian psychoanalytic theory. But in the Russian language, the concept takes on a representational concreteness lacking in contemporary Western discussions, where, at least among political theorists, it has come to mean little more than the logic of a discourse, or world (hypertext continued from previous page) environment, the terrain of absolute power, the license for terror. The French National Convention met in September 1792 to draw up a constitution, which was accepted by popular vote in 1793. But it was suspended by the Conventional Assembly that very year in order to combat the two forms of the aristocratic plot, the internal threat of civil war and the external threat of foreign war.86 For two years, both these forms existed simultaneously. But although the enemy principle (aristocratic privilege) was the same, the conception of the collective that was being threatened differed in significant ways, as did the form of defense: terror and war. The revolutionary Terror was launched against the internal "enemy of the people," defined in the Rousseauean sense as the opponent of the general will. The executive agency of the Terror, the Jacobin Committee of Public Safety, declared: "Whereas the French people has manifested its will, everyone who is opposed to it is outside the sovereignty; everyone outside the sovereignty is an enemy. . . . Between the people and its enemies, there is nothing in common but the sword."87 Sovereign legitimacy totally superseded constitutional legality in the Reign of Terror. "Under the fiction of the people’ Jacobinism substituted itself simultaneously for civil society, and for the state."88 Moreover, the fact that the leaders themselves fell victim to the rage of the guillotine seemed to provide proof that it was not holding power that legitimated sovereignty, but the sovereign people who legitimated holding power. Robespierre, idol of the Jacobins, embodied the logic of revolutionary sovereignty.89 His relation to the Terror was to produce the sovereign unity that "democracy" demanded: "He was the people to the sections, he was the people to the Jacobin Club, he was the people to the national representative body; it was continually necessary to establish, control and restore the perfect fit between the people and the various assemblies that claimed to speak in its name (above all the Convention), for without that perfect In contrast, the absolute enemy threatens the coherence of the imaginary system as a whole. So long as the enemy really acts like the enemy, it poses a threat to the system: there could be no legitimate power, and the first duty of power was to maintain it: that was the function of the Terror."90 The identity between Robespierre and the people, based on the "fiction of pure democracy," was, Furet writes, a "surrealist entity," the reverse side of which was the existence of an "inner circle" of power, "an organisation that prefabricated consensus and had exclusive control over it."91 Thus, in creating a "new god out of the fictive community of the people,"92 direct democracy produced a new, all-powerful state machine. It was Marx who called the Thermidorian reaction that put a halt to this machinery of Terror the "revenge of civil society."93 Robespierre was convicted of conspiracy against the Revolution, and himself guillotined. But, as Furet reminds us, with the end of the Terror, the problem of sovereign power again became acute. Those who had "toppled Robespierre in the name of liberty" had themselves been part of the Terror, "and often personally conducted brutal purges."94 In order to keep themselves in power, they had to create a counterdiscourse whereby Terror, far from the culmination of democratic Revolution, was seen (in the words of one participant) as "an unfortunate deviation from it."95 In order to disassociate themselves from the Terror, argues Furet, they "had to assign . . . the entire responsibility for it to Robespierre and his inner circle. Having once been the Revolution itself, the Terror now became the result of a plot, or the expedient of one man's tyranny."96 The intended analogy to Khrushchev's de-Stalinization of Soviet discourse is clear. The end of the Terror meant that revolutionary ideology no longer filled the entire terrain of governmental power. But the Thermidorians reconstituted that power by replacing absolute Terror with absolute war, inaugurating the other wild zone of modern sovereign power, the logic of which covered up a fundamental contradiction in French revolutionary discourse. The Declaration of the Rights of Man that provided the preamble to the constitution<previous page page_12 next page> Page 13:

(Ever since the con-
tion of 1792 was contradicted by the male, property-holding provisions of the constitution itself, a fact on which Furet does not dwell, but of which those who drew up the constitution were well aware.97 Within the discourse of war against a foreign enemy, however, the image of the collective was free of such embarrassing anomalies. The "French nation" implied a different test of revolutionary loyalty, not to the principle of social equality, but to the principle of equality on the battlefield in the face of death. August 23, 1793, was the first levée en masse, the first national mobilization of a state for war. Defense of la patrie became the very embodiment of the revolution, as the revolutionary agencies of the Terror were transformed into the wartime executors of the nation-state. With the end of the Terror in 1795, the war against the conservative sovereigns of Europe became "the focus of unity and of an ever-escalating revolutionary rhetoric."98 It was based on the ideological model of democratic nationalism that covered up the differences between peasant, professional, bourgeois, and sans-culotteFrenchmen all, engaged in a defensive war that became an aggressive war, glorified as an ideological crusade by the "grande nation, henceforth entrusted with a mission of universal liberation."99 Furet cites Marx's "brilliant analysis": "Napoleon [wrote Marx] was the last stand of revolutionary terror against bourgeois society... . Napoleon still regarded the State as its own end... . He carried the Terror to its conclusion by replacing the permanent revolution with permanent war." 100 The absolute war of the nation's democratic crusade "could only end in total victory or total defeat. "101 Under Napoleon, war became "the last refuge of revolutionary legitimacy. "102 The first modern emperor, Napoleon had no divine right to rule. His only legitimacy depended on keeping the war going. (He fought eighty battles.) His fall brought the restoration of monarchy. Furet writes: "In making the extraordinarily early synthesis between the messianic call of Page 14:

The early, more moderate phase of the French Revolution that made a radical rupture with the past was perceived in 1789 as the return of power to society, a reappropriation by the people of their sovereignty, a recovery of their "natural" rights. The notion of power residing equally in all the people rather than in the monarch, the secular conception of legitimate power, is what became the political project of modernity.

Page 15:

The realist school of international relations, which has been hegemonic in the West since the nineteenth century, still argues that states have total liberty to pursue their interests in opposition to the idea of divine right. This marks a decisive rupture from the political imaginary that existed prior to the French Revolution.

Page 16:

Liberal-democratic nation-states today have a more sanguine view of the social contract, and a more constrained view of sovereign power. The idea of replicating the domestic model of the social contract at the international level has had strong appeal in this century among advocates of the League of Nations and United Nations. However, the realist school of international relations remains hegemonic in the West, arguing that states have total liberty to pursue their interests in opposition to the idea of divine right. It is a project we have yet to realize. And if Furet puts the blame on direct democracy for the inadequacies of this unfinished project, we might do better to stress the other side of the phenomenon, the sovereign state, with its monopoly of the (violent) power to decide who counts as "the people" by constructing as their enemy a category of human beings who do not.

SEPARATION BETWEEN THE ECONOMIC AND THE POLITICAL (See page 19 TEXT)
Carl Schmitt emphasizes the fact that the imaginary system of nation-states developed in Europe as an exclusively political phenomenon.105 Political sovereignty was split off from the economy, or, better put, its internal logic depended on the exclusion of the economy from any visible position within the imaginary political terrain. Within modern Europe, a fundamental distinction came to be made between political possession of territory and economic ownership, so that even the enemy's property rights were protected. What this meant in practice was that despite all the exchanges of territory among European sovereign powers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries—and this was true also of the French revolutionary wars106—the system of property within those territories was not touched. As a private owner of property, you might end up owing taxes, political allegiance, or whatever to a new sovereign. Your land or business or factory might suddenly be French instead of German, or vice versa. But it would still be yours. Thus, in regard to actually existing property relations, the whole imaginary apparatus of political sovereignty went on in some extraterritorial (i.e., merely political) terrain.

What Schmitt calls the "fundamental respect for private property" remained.110 The United States accepted the European separation of political and economic discourses, as well as the exclusion of indigenous peoples from those to whom private property rights applied (see SPACE). Its foreign policy was from the beginning a conscious duality of political isolation and economic interrelation. In his farewell address, George Washington made this position explicit: "The great rule of conduct for us ... in extending our commercial relations, [is] to have with them as little political connection as possible." In keeping with bourgeois liberal theory, economic relations were expected to counter state animosities and foster peace. However, in practice, fostering economic relations with nations that were not economic equals became a means of political domination.

With regard to trade within the United States, the relationship between the economic and the political was similarly conceived, but with qualitatively different effects. While they were still separate discourses, operating with different and not necessarily complementary logics, they could be made to support each other. The degree of political sovereignty retained by the separate states weakened the national state, and interstate trade was called upon to compensate, strengthening and indeed building the nation-state, rather than operating independently of it.

Integrating the states within a "national economy" became a conscious political goal. The role of the federal government was to facilitate "free" trade among the states by supporting the construction of railroads and canals, while protecting nascent domestic industries from foreign (particularly European) competition through federal import tariffs. This is in essence the origin of import substitution policy, a means of nation-building through economic industrialization and protection from foreign competition, in order to produce an economically autarchic political regime.

Such thinking was taken up by the German economist Friedrich List and applied effectively as well to the German case as an alternative model to Britain's free-trade policy. There is great irony here. It was the thinking of List, not Marx (List's contemporary and outspoken opponent), that subsequently won out in the Soviet Union. Since List developed his ideas while living in the United States (where he wrote for a local Pennsylvania newspaper from 1825 to 1832), it was U.S. foreign-trade theory from the nineteenth century that provided the theoretical origin for the trade policy of the Soviet Union in the twentieth century.

The United States entered the club of imperial powers in 1898 after the Spanish-American War, annexing outright Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Guam, and Hawaii. But with the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine (1904), a discourse was established that differed from both European imperialism and earlier U.S. policy.115 While keeping up the appearance of a separation between the economic and the political, it made a connection between these categories, so that "freedom" took on an economic meaning and political intervention was the way to achieve it.116 Schmitt calls this the American principle of Grossraum (great space), a form of economic expansion that employed state violence without political annexation. 117

It can be noted that this imaginary of nation-states is purely political. The economy is seen to inhabit a different terrain. And although (as Friedrich List argued in the early nineteenth century)16 building an economy may be an explicit policy of the state and a powerful means of nation-building, the violence caused by economic activity is not perceived as political violence. So long as the law is obeyed, it is not a state concern. Indeed, relations of economic exploitation are considered quasi-natural. The state may intervene, using its force to maintain the law and order of property or to ameliorate the undesirable effects of the "free" economy, but these spheres remain conceptually distinct. This fact has allowed the nation-state system, conceived originally as a territorial sovereignty of European princes and kings, to persist into the twentieth century despite radical changes in (hypertext continued from previous page) The United States claimed "police" powers (a domestic term) over countries within its sphere of influence, as defined by the Monroe Doctrine, who were guilty of "chronic wrongdoing," understood primarily as economic "irresponsibility." Such powers were used to maintain the kind of order demanded by the presence in these countries of private American firms whose economic influence was often tantamount to political control. These actions were pictured as peacekeeping functions within the U.S. sphere of influencetemporary interventions that did not violate the territorial status quo. And, of course, far from violating property rights, the whole purpose was to protect them (or at least those of foreign businesses and domestic elites). Latin American countries assumed a third status, guaranteed by the United States: neither equal nation nor colony, but less-than-equal, "immature" nation. This status justified violation of their sovereign power but not of the territorial status quo.118 Despite the overarching economic context, the external facade of political borders in most (but not all) cases remained intact. The more bogus the separation between the economic and the political appeared to the Latin American countries themselves, the more adamantly it was defended by the U.S. government.119 No U.S. president spoke more loftily of constitutional democracy and national sovereignty than Woodrow Wilson; few upheld it less than he, sending "policing" troops into Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, and Nicaragua (which Wilson, thwarted by Congress, tried to annex outright), and ordering the U.S. On page 19, the text should read:

S. Army to invade Mexico. Precisely because he eschewed the language of Realpolitik, Wilson became deeply entangled within the real contradiction between national democratic ideals and actual economic control.120 As we have seen (COLD WAR ENEMIES), the political imaginary of Bolshevism threatened to collapse the economic and political distinction from the start. Wilson acknowledged after 1917 that revolu-

On page 20, the text should read:

tions "do not spring up overnight," and that the spread of Bolshevism into Europe was based on genuine mass appeal: "The people will not stand for a restoration of the old system of balance of power which led them to catastrophe and bloodshed. They will not let it happen again and if their governments cannot work out something better, they will destroy their governments."124 But he could not accept an economic definition, a revolution against a property order rather than a political order, without his own discursive landscape dissolving into incoherence.125 We can see just how much was at stake at the Paris Peace Conference. The Allies' task of reestablishing the rules of legitimacy after World War I was made perilous by Bolshevism, and not only in Europe.126 The U.S. policy of Grossraum, economic expansion through political violence, that stood behind the Roosevelt Corollary was also threatened. In the 1920s, Comintern policy in Latin America was "calculated to avoid trouble in a far removed region" and remained "low keyed," but U.S. reaction did not: blaming "Bolsheviks" for "injecting" a "virus" into Latin America became a common metaphor in the 1920s.127 Ironically, however, if the language of Bolshevism insisted on the absurdity of the separation of the economic and political as it had been articulated in U.S. foreign policy, it The logical connection between the Sovereign Party and the Socialist State (See page 23, Hypertext) is one of causality rather than identity. Whereas political parties in nation-states compete to gain control of a preexisting apparatus and thereby become the state, the Communist Party constructs the socialist state.20 It creates and uses state institutions to administer party policy, and it purges those institutions when it carries out a class war within them. But the distinction between the two remains. Moreover, the state is understood as a temporary expedient that will ultimately "wither away," an anarchist vision to which even Stalin gave lip service and which Khrushchev revived in political rhetoric in 1959.21

(Hypertext continued from previous page) Also, the United States provided a new justification for continuing its policy direction. Again, the figure of Wilson was central. "Wilsonianism" became synonymous with anti-Bolshevism, as the principle of "national self-determination" was called upon to function as a counterrevolutionary alternative to the principle of class. Economic conflict was translated into the discourse of territorial politics, so that resistance to capitalism was read as a sign of Soviet national presence.128 With this mapping of class struggle onto the political terrain of the nation-state system, the idea that any domestic social-revolutionary movement might be truly representative of the people of a particular nation became unthinkable.

An important corollary was that U.S. foreign policy now had a new field of action, the internal affairs of other nations, in order to prevent, as the highest priority, a successful socialist revolution in any one of them. One of the effects of this new policy was the establishment by the United States of a covert intelligence agency with the mandate to "stabilize" foreign governments against Communism. This institution—a wild zone of power, pure and simple—had its birth during negotiations at Versailles, and got a new and stronger lease on life under similar conditions after World War II, with the establishment in 1947 of the Central Intelligence Agency.

In 1919, under the authority of Herbert Hoover, "agents" in civilian clothes were attached to the humanitarian efforts of emergency assistance relief programs in war-torn countries, and charged with the mission of collecting information on the degree of "Bolshevik threat." Poland was of particular concern, where the new government faced an actual invasion by the Red Army in 10. The deploying of secret agents was an application of the Monroe Doctrine's principle of "police powers" well out of bounds of the space for which it was designed, and it was infinitely more dangerous because clandestine. This was the origin of the U.S. national security state, the institutional bedrock of the Cold War. 
With the collapse of the Second International in 1914 due to the conflicting loyalties of class and nation, the role of nationalism within Marxism became a volatile, highly disputed point.22 Lenin's position was to affirm ethnic nations as a transitional and tactical means to the ultimate socialist-communist goal (whereas Stalin's regime privileged the Russian nation as historically the most "advanced"). 

Ethnic nations were assimilated into Soviet society so that their loyalty to sovereign power would not be in doubt. Ironically, seventy years after the Bolshevik Revolution, Western scholars were pronouncing Lenin's original nationalist policy a success in the Soviet Union just as the breakup of the socialist bloc resulted in a whole new wave of nationalist movements, as well as new instances of the limit case of ethnic cleansing (which might have been expected given the logic of nation-states).23 But rather than going into any more detail about the differing philosophical rationales of these two models of democratic sovereignty, I want to point out (hypertext continued from previous page) 
1947 the U.S. National Security Council was established, to which the CIA was responsible. It justified the secret use of violence against threats to national security secretly defined, violating every democratic right in the name of protecting democracy. Although a domestic organization, its field of action was international, paralleling the illegal, underground activities of indigenous Communist parties. In effect, the president of the United States bestowed upon himself the right to engage clandestinely in any warlike operation against any group in any country of the world threatening to overthrow a government friendly to the Western political and capitalist order—without that power being checked either by the elected legislative assembly of the president's own country or by any democratic representative of the country in which intervention occurred. During the Cold War, the United States collaborated with foreign police forces in the task of "containing communism" in their countries. It exported the national security state model to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Mexico, and Venezuela, ensuring the establishment within nominally constitutional democracies of enormous wild zones of state violence, training "civil police" within these countries in terror and torture techniques to be used against their citizens, and giving both clandestine and diplomatic support to their systematic violation of human rights—all justified as the defense of "national sovereignty" against the threat of "communist" takeovers.129 As Henry Kissinger stated notoriously in response to the Chilean people's choice of a Marxist, Salvador Allende, as president through free democratic elections: "I don't see why we need stand by and watch a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its own people."130 Given the traditional American formula of economic presence and political absence, the Cold War was vital for the legitimacy of U.S. foreign interventions in the twentieth century. 

Space has absolute priority in the political imaginary of nation-states. To be a nation is to possess a territory (in contrast to Bolshevik theory, which in 1917 recognized nationalities both with and without territories).24 Thus, as Hannah Arendt observed, the Israeli state became a necessity in the twentieth century, in a Western world where only nation-


degree of political interference in other nations' affairs in order to protect the economic order of property had nothing but the ideologically dubious Roosevelt Corollary on which to stand. But as the protection of freedom (rather than private property) from a political threat (rather than economic irresponsibility), this intervention was perceived as a protection of the whole ideal system of nation-states, which then, entering another imaginary space, participated in the "free" global economy. By taking away this pretext, the end of the Cold War has taken away the unique formula for legitating the peculiarly American form of domination. This special kind of imperialism that insists it is no imperialism cannot continue to exist if the political enemy ceases to exist. One should not underestimate the seriousness of the implications. While the IMF and the World Bank take on the role of punishing economic "irresponsibility" for the good of the "free" world (as yet without military power), United States sovereignty faces an enormous crisis of legitimacy—not only internationally as a superpower, where it now throws the weight of its weaponry about in military showdowns, flaunting force as an end in itself, but also domestically, where the collectivity of its citizens remains an abstract conception, in practice rent by class divisions that are complicated by collective identities of ethnicity and race. We have yet to experience fully the concrete forms of this crisis. The earliest response was the production of a wild zone of power as a militarized "war on drugs." Turning away from symptoms of a new enemy within—domestic terrorism by white male citizens from the country's heartland—the U.S. security state again focused on Latin American nations, giving renewed legitimation to their authoritarian practices. By connecting the war on drugs to international terrorism, the United States expanded the war zone to a global terrain. The resulting imaginary landscape, in which the global migrant labor force could be surveilled as "illegal"



25 Thus also, Palestinian nationalism has become synonymous with the sovereign claim to a land-based state. Within the territorial system of nation-states, all politics is geopolitics. The enemy is situated 'within a geographical landscape. The dividing line between friend and foe is the national frontier. Transgressing that frontier is the causus belli. The conclusion of war brings about a redistribution of territorial sovereignty. On the other hand, the terrain of class warfare is temporal. Class revolution is a historical event understood as an advance in time. What constitutes a victory is described in terms of historical progress rather than territorial gain. As Trotsky said, the revolution "does not come to an end after this or that political conquest"; its "only boundary is a socialist society. Page 24

Civil war is a tragedy for the nation-state, a threat to its very being, whereas for class revolution it is a step toward the desired historical goal. The historical dimension is quite strikingly absent (or perhaps repressed) in the political imaginary of the nation-state system. Geopolitics favors the status quo. Revolution is viewed as destabilizing and abnormal, to be avoided at all costs. Time is a vacant category waiting to be filled by the political drama of wars and the activities of states. Progress does enter this imaginary as a concept, but it is a spatial one, equated with the "spread of European civilization" (colonialism) or the "expansion of the free world" (neoimperialism). Typical of this geopolitical imaginary is the statement "History is space over time," which has become a cliché within the Western discourse of international relations. Compare this with Lenin's explanation in 1918 of his willingness to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which ceded the whole of the Ukraine to the Germans: "I want to concede space [continued on next page] Page 24:


In mid-February 1918, the German national army renewed its attack on the Russian front. By spring, still no major foreign power had recognized the new Soviet Republic—the state that did not want to be one—and Allied troops landed in the North and Far East to aid anti-Bolshevik forces in the Civil War. Trotsky's appointment as Commissar of the Army and Navy in mid-March signaled a radical change in military policy, the goal of which was now to create a disciplined, professional fighting force. Its attainment meant rolling back democratic reforms, such as election of officers, that soldiers had gained in the first revolutionary year. The right of all citizens to bear arms under a principle of voluntary service was replaced by obligatory military training, and army service (as opposed to working-class status) became central to the definition of citizenship. In response to the crisis of the Civil War, the party backed up its sovereign claims with a new instrument of coercion, the Cheka, the political police of the state. 137

In class warfare, space is merely tactical, not the political goal, whereas for the nation-state, time is tactical and space is everything. I remember from my schooldays maps of Europe in 1870, 1919, 1945, with each map representing a different configuration of sovereign territories, each sovereign state a different color. But even our time charts were spatial, with the size allotted to each civilization expanding or contracting according to its waxing and waning political importance. This exclusively spatial imaginary leads to absurdities. Consider, in the nation-state model, the terminological distinction between friend and foe as East versus West, with Cuba somehow belonging to the East and Japan secured for the West. But this is perhaps no more bizarre than the practice of the Soviet transport system that placed all of the Soviet Union officially on Moscow time. In both political imaginaries, there is a dialectical relation between nation and class. Within the nation-state model, class differences are not denied,

(hypertext continued from previous page) Forced requisitioning of grain for the army's provisioning was organized locally by "committees of the village poor" (kombednyi) who acted as agents of (and spies for) the center. In August, Trotsky ordered the court martial and shooting of a commissar for desertion, and despite continued protests from the People's Commissariat of Justice, hundreds of soldiers and officers in subsequent months were tried and executed by the reestablished military tribunals. 138 The Central Committee of the Communist Party stated expressly that a continued "Red Terror" in order to counter the White Terror was crucial and should be applied ruthlessly, not only "against outright traitors and saboteurs, but against all cowards, self-seekers, connivers, and concealers."139 These latter categories, of course, did not necessarily comprise class enemies, and it was a portent of future abuses.140 During the Civil War, the Red Army's formal allegiance was to the Communist International (Comintern, established in 1919) rather than to the Soviet state, signaling that the use of violence was legitimated in defense of class interests, not national ones.141 The 1918 Fundamental Law that established the state embodied the communal principle of the soviets in whose name power had been seized in October.142 They were to be the highest authorities in their territories, sending elected representatives to the Congress of Soviets, which as the law-making assembly was the "supreme organ of the state."143 Although their power remained largely symbolic, the "impeccably sound revolutionary origins" of the soviets meant that they remained ideologically central to the democratic legitimacy of the socialist state.144 The title, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (founded by treaty in 1922), implied a new transnational form of societal governance.145 According to Lenin, the establishment of the Soviet federation was to provide a transitional framework toward the goal of complete unity among the workers of various nations, all of whom would be organized within soviets.146 This vision was given institutional expression in the Soviet constitution of 1924, which, while legitimating the USSR, was described as a decisive step toward the "union of all countries in the World Soviet Socialist Republic."147 But even if the separate socialist state was understood as temporary, internal state-building during the era of NEP produced powerful institutions of governance that increased the reach and scope of the Bolshevik regime enormously. At the same time, the conceived separation of the state from the party made it possible for the former to take on a degree of political neutrality that would have been impossible for the Communist Party, the legitimacy of which continued to rest on its vanguard position in the class struggle. While debates raged within the party as to what constituted proper revolutionary practice, state institutions tackled the basic problems of administering society, allowing for compromise without compromising the party. Repeatedly, Lenin's position in the debates within the party was to opt for what he saw as a depoliticized solution, appealing to science rather than revolutionary ideology, technical expertise rather than class consciousness.

The self-standing economic bureaucracy that managed industry could be seen as exemplifying Marx's statement that under socialism, the governance of people would be replaced by the administration of things. At the same time, the intended neutrality of state institutions, which had the advantage of regularizing procedures and enforcing the law in a less arbitrary manner, encouraged a tendency toward bureaucracy and the ascendancy of a class of bureaucrats that Lenin deplored. The number of persons employed by the state rose from 600,000 in 1917 to four million by 1928, centralizing power and structurally eliminating possibilities for the expression of political opposition.

The degree to which the workers themselves could be relied upon by the party became a divisive issue in the early years. Lenin made the statement at the Eleventh Party Congress (1922) that people coming to the factory as workers were often “not proletarians but all kinds of accidental elements." Local party cadres were not to interfere in the activities of technical experts, factory managers, or local bureaucrats, all of whom, as state employees, were answerable to the party indirectly, through their obedience to officials at the top. Given the growing state bureaucracy, how was party control to be maintained? Policy decisions were made at the highest state level, that of Sovnarkom (USSR Council of People's Commissars), which was the coordinating body of the bureaucracy made up of the heads of each of the commissariats. The Central Committee of the Communist Party was represented, as a commissariat, on Sovnarkom, but the party was not an administrative body in other than its own concerns. At the same time, following the model developed by Trotsky in the case of the Red Army, state organizations began to be monitored internally from early on by party "factions" (fraktsii) appointed to work alongside the experts and guarantee their loyalty.156 This practice of dual command led to the drawing up of a list of names of party members (the nomenklatura), who were available for appointment to designated key posts not only within the governing bodies under Sovnarkom, but in all socialist "state" institutions, including factories, universities, schools, unions, and soviets. A centralized hierarchy of party "cells" (iacheiki) evolved that shadowed these organizations in order to keep

actions become identified with historical progress itself, which suggests an infallibility of the party and a deterministic view of the future. On the other hand, if the party admits that it has not fulfilled its vanguard role, it faces a crisis of legitimacy, so that its own members become the victims of the most extreme forms of sovereign terror. It is noteworthy in this connection that in the last years of glasnost', Gorbachev began to shift the base of his sovereign legitimacy when in 1988 he became President of the Supreme Soviet (the elected USSR legislature), deriving support from this de jure (if not de facto) democratic body rather than from his role as party chief. And it is no surprise that this shift was accompanied by a growing threat to the very existence of the Soviet Union, as the republics of which it was composed evoked the alternative, nation-state model of legitimacy in order to challenge power at the center. Given the different terrains within which the deployment of power occurs, there are qualitative differences in the forms of abuses of power. In them politically honest and to systematize the maintaining of party loyalty.157 Since the party was political, the state did not have to be.158 That was the rationale in the 1920s for the extension of state institutions that would be answerable to the party at the top level and monitored by party cells within them. The departments of state, or commissariats, were otherwise free to administer policy according to professional norms, implementing party policies rather than producing them. To a certain extent, "stateness" (gosudarstvennost') defused political dissension by holding its institutions apart from ideological battles. But by the late 1920s, these institutions began to be openly criticized by "class-conscious" workers, soldiers, intellectuals, and others, who found themselves confronted with prerevolutionary personnel in positions of power as state bureaucrats, army officials, factory engineers, and university professors. Stalin took advantage of their discontent by giving it political expression. Whereas Lenin had built state institutions as a neutral zone, Stalin purged them by attacking the experts in the name of renewed class warfare, ensuring his own rise to power in the process.159 Yet even Stalin did not eliminate the distinction between the party and the state.160 The significance of this dual system, whereby party sovereignty was separate from and above state sovereignty, should not be underestimated.161 Scholars have long recognized its existence, and yet, in the words of the social historian Stephen Kotkin, "the duplication of state and party structures remains a question crying out for historical explanation."162 Kotkin describes the party-state as a theocracy, wherein the party was the site of doctrinal purity and the state was responsible for its implementation.163 But in arguing that Communism was "a matter of faith" that prevented the development of a secular state and perpetuated the "redundant" parallel of party organizations, Kotkin does not attend to the question of sovereign legitimation on which the existence of the USSR depended.164

The geopolitics of nation-states, war as a military practice involves an enormous and grotesque exaggeration of the development of weapons technology. Physical destruction is the dominant tactic of national wars. It is indiscriminate, taking a frightful toll on the lives of soldiers and civilians alike, catastrophically demolishing the material world—cities, factories, farmlands, jungles, industries, transportation networks—and involving the whole planet in these orgies of annihilation. This particular insanity of power is inherent in the political imaginary of modern nation-states, and in the specific kinds of war machines that they create.

The political imaginary of class warfare has its own horrors. Because class war is civil war, the war zone is superimposed upon the space of the "normal" state, so that, potentially, all of civil society is under siege. For a future utopia, the present is sacrificed. The terrain of power extends limitlessly, threatening to obliterate private space completely. Civil society's associations—

Party sovereignty did not have constitutional status. But the constitution of this revolutionary state was not the source of legitimation, which was and remained the working class—however problematic it continued to be for the party who represented it to define this class.165 Today, when so many soi-disant "progressive" political groups are putting their faith in "civil society," it is worth noting that the Soviet Union was perhaps the first modern state to be under civil society's sovereign control.166 The Communist Party was not a state organization but public (obshchestvennaia) and voluntary, described in the 1936 constitution as one organization of (civil) society among many. However, defined as the "leading core of all organizations of the working people, both public and state," it had the authority to intervene anywhere within both of these domains.167 The USSR was a workers' state. If it gave up this definition, it gave up its right to exist. It was the party as "leading core" of the working class that gave legitimacy to the state, and not vice versa.168 The party's operations, legitimately, were secret, taking place within a wild zone of power that was theoretically limitless in scope. Its members were committed, as part of party discipline, to keeping secrets and "observing the conspiracy" (sobliudat konspiratsiiu). Moreover, it was above the law.171 To fulfill this purpose, its tasks were to protect the existence of the state as a revolutionary, worker's state.172 This complex power arrangement set the stage for events to come.174 Because the Communist Party was the legitimating embodiment of the revolution, it was crucial that it remain above reproach. On the one hand, access to the party's limitless zone of power required limitless party obligation.175 On the other hand, however, because of their privileged access to jobs, goods, and power, members of the nomenklatura became local elites, exposed to superhuman temptations to violate the criteria of their special calling.176 The party was an ideal of which people always fell short, so that purification was necessary to provide for continued sanctity of party power above the law. There were therefore periodic purges (chistki) in order to maintain the "purity" (chistota) of the ranks. This process was not in itself terroristic. Being purged meant only expulsion from the party; it was stipulated explicitly that one should not be dismissed from one's everyday job. What made people fear the purges was not the party, but falling out of the party's immunity and into the jurisdiction of law, as in some instances (not all, since violating party discipline was itself not a legal violation) expulsions were followed by arrest by the "secular authority" of the NKVD.177 In 1936, as one more extreme measure in a series of verification procedures, all old party cards were to be exchanged for new ones. It provided an occasion for inquiring into the purity of every member, and a "radical revival of the party's ideological mission."178 What made this purge different from previous ones was the context. On August 19, 1936, sixteen high party officials were tried in Moscow for acts of terrorism. This "Trotskyite-Zinovievite Bloc" confessed to their crimes, and on August 24 they were shot. It was the first time the death penalty had been used against communists expelled from the party. 179 Prior to this, only "bour-" (hypertext continued on next page) < previous page page_30 next page > file:///E|/-=%o20%CD%EO%F8%E8B%20%EF%F3%E1 %EB%...%20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_30.html [21.01.2009 0:31:47] page_31 < previous page page_31 next page > Page 31 ordinary war powers can be invoked at any time, and, even when this requires procedures of debate and consent (democratic centralism within the party; the declaration of war or the voting of war credits by parliaments), once the state of war exists, the wild zone of power that it creates is a space in which the absolute obedience of the collective is demanded.

Frangois Furet, the French Revolution "invented a type of political discourse and practice by which we have been living ever since." It was a utopian discourse of equality, and of the "people" as sovereign. But it also produced, as the two catastrophic forms of modern political life, revolutionary terror and mass-conscripted, nationalist war.

According to Hegel, the enemy is: "ethical difference [die sittliche Differenz] as an alien being that is to be negated [als ein zu negierendes Fremdes] in its living totality [in seiner lebendigen Totalitét]." Hegel describes the "nothingness of the enemy [das Nichts des Feindes]" as the "opposite of the being of oppositions [Gegenteil des Seins der Gegensdtze]," which implies the absolute character of the enemy. Carl Schmitt cites this passage from Hegel.

But his own definition is not so close to Hegel's as he would have us assume. Schmitt abruptly, in late 1938, removed Ezhov from his post as People's Commissar of Internal Affairs, head of the NKVD. Ezhov was arrested and shot.

The conception of a world divided spatially seems to have been a distinctly European invention. Beginning as far back as 1492 with the edict of Pope Alexander VI, lines were drawn, literally, to delineate which part of the globe "belonged" to which European sovereign power. This "jus publicum Europaeum" was the beginning of what Carl Schmitt calls "global linear thinking," the first planetary political imaginary.

The New World of the Americas, along with Africa and Asia, entered into this spatial order in accord with their relationship to the European center. All lands either belonged to a European state or were declared, with extraordinary arrogance, "open spaces," "free to be occupied."

The real-world consequences of this declaration marked the history of humankind for half a millennium. It is difficult to take solace in the fact that Eurocentrism, a global imaginary of unsurpassed brutality, needed ideological justification, the legitimating lie that Europe's violent exploitation was a civilizing process imposed on an uncivilized world—the assertion that this spatial domination was itself temporality, the relentless forward march of historical progress.

European imperialism increased the wild zone of sovereign power so massively as to affect the entire non-European world. The United States challenged Eurocentrism by adopting Europe's spatial principle as its own. Two aspects of the U.S. political imaginary were "ur-forms" in the sense that they anticipated later forms more generally.

One was its systematic push westward in order to spread the progress it believed itself to embody by annexing what was referred to as "empty territory." This was done in repeated violation of treaties with Indian tribes, the consequence of which was the near-genocide of these native people. It prefigured in certain (if not all) aspects the later forms of spatial domination.

Whereas the former terms refer to individual persons, the latter (polemos and hostis) delineate the political enemy, the public enemy, which, as a collective term, is always an abstraction. You have nothing against this enemy personally. It is a category within the logic of sovereign power. Or, to use a different terminology, the enemy occupies the position of the "other" within the imaginary political terrain. But in occupying this position—and this is something Schmitt does not see—the enemy loses the absolute character implied by Hegel's definition. We need to remind ourselves of Podoroga's important point that so long as the enemy stays in its place, keeping the position allotted to it within the political imaginary, so long, in short, as the enemy behaves like the enemy, it is not a threat in the absolute sense. We need to go beyond Schmitt and develop a distinction between two types of political enemy, allowing for the category of Hegel's "opposite of the being of oppositions," whose threat to the collective is on the metalevel, and who, by not behaving like the enemy, is truly dangerous, because it threatens the legitimating imaginary system tout court. There are then two levels, the normal, safe enemy who acts like the enemy as defined within one's own imaginary terrain, and the absolute enemy on the far side of the great political divide between the imaginary systems themselves. It is the absolute political enemy that threatens the existence of the collective not only (and perhaps not mainly) in a physical sense but, rather, in an ontological sense, because it challenges the very notion by which the identity of the collective has been formed. The absolute enemy becomes symbolic of absolute evil, against which no mercy is possible.

To give an example from earlier European history, in the logic of medieval Christendom, sinners are normal, safe enemies, whereas heretics who challenge the legitimacy of Christian dogma are the absolute enemy and cannot be tolerated even if they are peaceful. The analogy to the twentieth-century world is clear. For most of its duration, the models of mass-democratic sovereignty in East and West confronted each other as absolute enemies, because each political imaginary excluded the other's fundamental claim to legitimacy.

In the 1980s, such nationalism became common in capitalist countries, as the restructuring of the global economy threatened to undermine the welfare gains that workers had achieved. During the Cold War, the working classes within Western nations benefited economically from Western fears of Communism, winning political concessions at the level of nation-states. But global restructuring has caused these states to lose control over the economic system.

The new economic blocs—the European Community, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the Chinese Communist Empire—were all, in their different ways, centralized, top-down systems. They all presupposed the legitimacy of their political imaginary, and each, in its own way, enforced the collective will. The collective will, however, was not a democratic process, but rather a centralized, bureaucratic imposition of a specific political imaginary.

In the early twentieth century, racist and xenophobic rhetoric appealed to U.S. workers threatened by new immigrants, and national borders became their line of job defense. The United States was neither ethnically nor linguistically united at its founding, but the collective became a nation ex post facto, by entering the territorial space in which the social contract applied. Assimilation of immigrants became a dominant theme of U.S. nation-building, producing a multiethnic, international proletariat within domestic borders. But class solidarity was not necessarily the result.

In the aftermath of the First World War, the political geography of modern Europe began to be formed. With the defeat of the German-Austrian Empire, the political geography of the continent was redefined by the victors, who were the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The lines that were drawn during this period were not borders of mutual recognition between nations in the European continental sense. Rather, like the European colonial boundaries that were often drawn with only a vague notion of who lived inside them, they became the creator of difference, anticipating territorial sovereignty.

The Paris Peace Conference, held in 1919 in a room at Versailles (or later at Neuilly, St.-Germain, Trianon, and Sévres), used maps and pencils to create "nations" from the complex ethnic regions of central Europe, altering profoundly the borders of Poland, Denmark, Belgium, Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Austria, Greece, and the former Ottoman Empire, as well as Germany and France. The Cold War Enemies (see page 2, Hypertext) were deployed on an ontological divide, and what Churchill named the Iron Curtain became its geophysical manifestation. This boundary was defensive not only in a military sense but in the conceptual sense that it prevented contamination from the imaginary perceptions held by the absolute "other." The boundary had a different meaning for each side, as we would expect. For the political imaginary of nation-states, it cordoned off socialism, which was perceived spatially by isolating it spatially, in order to prevent its spread to the "free world." For the political imaginary of class warfare, the (hypertext continued from previous page) EEC, Japan-dominated Asia, United-States-dominated NAFTA represent developments in spatial ordering motivated by interests often at odds with political and social democracy at the national level, challenging the traditional political imaginary in fundamental ways. The future of the nation-state is by no means secure.

If the United States and other governments become increasingly unwilling (or unable) to continue to honor the principles of the welfare state compromise between capitalists and workers, how will the "people" react? Moreover, who are the people in the new, globally oriented nation-state? If immigrant groups using the rhetoric of multiculturalism resist the traditional goal of assimilation, will the consequence be universal toleration regardless of nation-state boundaries, or renewed calls for ethnic purity within them? Will the spatial model of nation-state sovereignty survive not only the globalizing tendencies of our time but also domestic struggles against these tendencies? Is the Balkanization created by ethnic hatred an atavistic return to an earlier era, or a portent of the century to come? The answers to these questions will determine what it means ultimately to have "won" the Cold War.

Time (see page 22, Text) Zinoviev, as head of the Comintern, justified the Red Army's offensive against Poland in 1920 by arguing confidently that "old Europe was hurtling towards the proletarian revolution," and he asserted a fundamental distinction between "revolutionary" and "reactionary" interventions into the space of other nations in terms of time.198 Under Trotsky's leadership, there was a militarization of (hypertext continued on next page) Page 36:

This was soothing and reassuring, because it normalized the enemy. Thus within the landscape of class war, the nationalist (hypertext continued from previous page) that space. But when the anticipation of a European revolution was replaced by the "weakest link" theory (the argument that the proletariat in the underdeveloped countries was most strategically situated to break the imperialist system), and when "socialism in one country" was proclaimed to be economically feasible as well as a political reality, time became the overriding concern. In his report to the Congress of Soviets in 1921, Lenin admitted: "We imagined . . . that future developments would take a more simple, more direct form," but instead, "a strange situation" had developed, whereby the Revolution occurred and was possible to sustain in Russia, "one of the most backward and very weak states."199 Lenin's response to this anomaly in history was to picture "two worlds" that, while they might temporarily be distinguished geographically, actually referred to two stages of history, "the old world of capitalism that is in a state of confusion . . . and the rising new world, which is still very weak, but which will grow, for it is invincible."200 Here already is the origin of the discourse of "peaceful coexistence," never justified as a territorial division between the capitalist and socialist world, but always as a temporary, transitional situation—to use Lenin's words, a "certain unstable equilibrium."201 Faced with this gap between the political vanguard and historically "backward" economic conditions, Lenin's New Economic Policy (NEP) was one of compromise with peasants and entrepreneurs during an "epoch" (not a space) of retreat, justified precisely because Communists could claim that "time is working on our side."202 Lenin's position on economic development, as well as on the nationalities question, was to tolerate the gap between politics and socioeconomic conditions, encouraging a "breathing space" in which political culture might be articulated and the institutions of civil society might have time to develop. Stalin's policy, in contrast, was to force a closing of this gap. His policy for economic development was itself a declaration of war (see COLD WAR ENEMIES). (hypertext continued on next page) Moreover, (hypertext continued from previous page) There is no doubt that Civil War imagery was resurrected by Stalin during the First Five Year Plan, and that, as Fitzpatrick argues, "War Communism was the point of reference if not the model for many of the policies associated with the industrialization drive and collectivization."203 But what needs to be noted is that by transposing the discourse of civil war—a political zone—onto the terrain of economic development, Stalin was doing something decidedly different (if not altogether new).204 He militarized the space of historical transition and turned the terrain of economic development and peasant collectivization itself into a war zone—a "wild zone" for the deployment of the machinery of absolute power. It was not a question, as in war communism, of mobilizing the economy for war, but of mobilizing the economy as war. Moreover, it was a war against time. The rapid industrialization of the First Five Year Plan was conceived as historical "acceleration" (uskorenie). Lewin writes: "The pace and violence of the changes were breathtaking," as no one was positioned in society in 1938 where they had been in 1928; at the same time, "the sense of urgency in the whole upheaval is baffling: the pace imposed suggests a race against time, as if those responsible for the country's destinies felt they were running out of history."205 Under Stalin, "speeding up by force became the cure-all."206 Any proposal for "slowing the tempo" (gromozhenie) of economic production became tantamount to counterrevolution.207 The present was an obstacle to be overcome, a continual sacrifice for the sake of the communist future. Mikhail Heller has described the concept of the Five Year Plan, initiated by Stalin, as the "nationalization of time" whereby the head of state became time's master. Historical progress was forced dictatorially by the Plan. The sovereign agent had absolute power not only over material resources, but also over time.208 If Stalin could order time to speed up, he could also slow it down—or stop it completely, once "so- (hypertext continued on next page) < previous page page_37 next page > file:///E|/-=%o20%CD%EO%F8%E8B%20%EF%F3%E1 %EB%... %20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_37.html [21.01.2009 0:31:54] page_38 < previous page page_38 next page > Page 38 the discourse of legitimation generates power as well as rationalizing it after the fact. The Reagan policy in Nicaragua of arming the counterrevolutionaries in order to prevent the "spread" of communism into "our front yard" was, arguably, based less on class interests than on reproducing the spatial-imaginary terms of the Cold War itself.36 The fact that he had difficulty winning popular support for this policy was an indication that the reproduction of these terms already faced a crisis. And of course the economic realities in Soviet society that belied the continued talk of being in the vanguard of history demonstrated a parallel crisis of legitimacy within the class model of sovereignty. Note that these crises were not caused by the enemy, but by conditions immanent to each system on its own. This brings me to my concluding point, and it is a materialist, indeed a Marxist one—so let us allow Marx to have the last word. Both political imaginaries that we have been considering on a theoretical level, as ideal Thus, in March 1930, Stalin gave a speech calling for a slowdown in the collectivization drive, which had caused famine and which he now blamed on overenthusiastic party members who had moved too quickly and become "dizzy with success." Yet, scarcely a year later (February 1931), he stated in a speech to industrial managers: "It is sometimes asked whether it is not possible to slow down the tempo somewhat, to put a check on the movement. No, comrades, it is not possible! . . . To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten... . We are fifty or a hundred years behind the advanced countries. We must make good this distance within ten years. Either we do so, or we will be crushed."210

Translating the spatial struggle between city and country into the temporal discourse of class struggle justified persecution of the peasants as "people from the past." All peasant resistance was defined as class resistance that slowed down the course of history, and "in this way, the state ‘kulakized' the countryside and could therefore wage war on the entire peasantry according to the 'iron laws' of history."211 The national question, too, was transposed into a discourse of time, as backward cultures and ethnic groups came under attack as vestiges of an earlier era. In the 1920s, it was still possible to argue that the indigenous peoples of the north and of Central Asia had elements of classlessness and "primitive communism" that might make their transition to socialism easier.212 But by the 1930s, their whole culture was seen as hostile to revolution and historical progress. The small "vanguard" of indigenous leaders trained by the party provided only a tenuous hold against the "backwardness" that, like a "swamp," threatened to swallow up everyone.213

"The advanced peoples are tearing along in the fast locomotive of history. .. . At the same time, the backward people have to 'race like the wind’... in order to catch up."214 The logic of this vision was self-evident: "If the whole of the USSR, in the words of Comrade Stalin, needs ten years to run the course of development that took Western Europe fifty to a hundred years, then the small peoples of the north, in order to catch up with the advanced nations of the USSR, must, during the same ten years, cover the road of development that took the Russian people one thousand years to cover. The equation of revolutionary time with economic modernization implied the obliteration of indigenous cultures, as it did the traditional peasant class. During glasnost', a serious challenge to the discourse of "development" came from intellectual and political spokespersons for the indigenous groups, who criticized publicly the economic and ecological disasters caused by attempts at modernization that were totally inappropriate for their cultures. This exposure went together with a call for the "restoration of sovereignty" usurped by the party/state to "the people" (narod) as its legitimate source. By questioning the Soviet imaginary of time, it weakened the legitimacy of the Soviet Union. The connection between cultural time and political revolution was central to the Soviet experience and is dealt with extensively in the next chapter.

II DREAMWORLDS OF HISTORY
A Note on Method
Section 2.1 assembles historical facts of Bolshevik cultural politics around the armature of revolutionary time to show how this structuring of the imaginary field caused perceptual distortions within it. Section 2.2 accepts as given the shattering of that time structure. It rescues the past in fragments, accessible to us in disparate images rather than the total picture, in order to challenge the accepted version of the twentieth century and reopen the case.

Chapter 2 On Time
2.1 Revolutionary Time

A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon—authoritarian means, if such there be at all.
Friedrich Engels, "On Authority"

In some respects, a revolution is a miracle.
V.I. Lenin, 1921

Several months after the October Revolution, Anatolii Lunacharskii, newly appointed as head of the People's Commissariat of Enlightenment (Narkompros), reported to a meeting of artists and sculptors: "I have just come from Vladimir Ilich [Lenin]. Once again he has had one of those fortunate and profoundly exciting ideas with which he has so often shocked and delighted us. He ints to decorate Moscow's squares with statues and monuments to revolutionaries and the great fighters for socialism."

Lenin had told him that this plan for "monumental propaganda" was for long his cherished idea. It was to be public art that wrote history onto urban space. The masses would see history as they moved through the city. The revolution entered the phenomenal world of the everyday. Innovative in Lenin's idea was the adaptation of a nationalist art form for socialist ends. Whereas in the nineteenth century monument-building became an obsession of nation-states as a means of celebrating (and creating) their own particular pasts, Lenin's monuments evoked an international heritage. The twenty-one Russians on the list of approved "fighters for socialism" included many assassins or would-be assassins of royalty, not the category usually memorialized by national regimes. There were nineteen Europeans, half of them French, among them a cluster of Revolutionary heroes: Danton, Marat, and Babeuf; later, Robespierre was added. Cultural figures were among the "revolutionaries," including Heinrich Heine and Frédéric Chopin. Paul Cézanne's name was seriously considered. Material was in short supply. Statues were hastily built out of plaster or cement, replacing monuments from the tsarist era that were just as hastily disassembled. Time mattered. The meaning of history was being constructed. If the Bolshevik victory in Petrograd was to be more than an urban coup, it needed to assume the mantle of sovereign legitimacy presently claimed by the provisional government, established after the February Revolution and abdication of the tsar. The Russian people had already been proclaimed "free citizens" in the Western, bourgeois-democratic sense; the "new era" had allegedly begun. When the Bolsheviks led the crowd that forcefully evicted that government, headed by Kerenskii, from the tsar's Winter Palace, nothing less than world history was called upon to legitimate the act. The October events were to be understood in this sublime context, not merely as a case of catching up with the West but of superseding it, advancing the world-revolutionary tradition to its highest culmination. Without this interpretation, the palace storming was vandalism, and the overthrow of the provisional government was treason. It is history that legitimates political revolution, at least since Hegel and including Marx. The suturing of history's narrative discourse transforms the violent rupture of the present into a continuity of meaning. One has to imagine the tenuousness of the situation. With the expected workers' revolution in Europe delayed indefinitely, Lenin counted the days for proof that the Bolshevik victory could outlast the revolutionary Paris Commune of 1871. Why, when even fellow Marxists believed a period of bourgeois democracy in Russia was a historical necessity, should the Bolshevik splinter group gain hegemony, not only of the political discourse but of the cultural discourse as well? Mass support existed for the October events, but it was not of a single mind. Millennialists, avant-gardists, and utopian dreamers of every sort were eager to interpret the revolutionary future as their own. Bolshevism needed to speak for all of these people, structuring their desires inside a historical continuum that, at the same time, contained their force. In the process of being inserted into the temporal narrative of revolutionary history, the utopian dimension of a wide variety of discourses was constrained and reduced. Page 44:

Lenin told the British science fiction writer H. G. Wells, who interviewed him in the Kremlin in 1920, that if life were discovered on other planets, revolutionary violence would no longer be necessary: "Human ideas," he told Wells, "are based on the scale of the planet we live in. They are based on the assumption that the technical potentialities, as they develop, will never overstep 'the earthly limit'. If we succeed in making contact with the other planets, all our philosophical, social and moral ideas will have to be revised, and in this event these potentialities will become limitless and will put an end to violence as a necessary means of progress."

Page 45:
Utopian discourses abounded in Russia (and among Russians in exile) in the decade before the Revolution. It was, then as now, the turn of a century, and the pulse of culture was an alternating current of imagined endings and new beginnings. In a country still inadequately connected by rail, flying machines real and imagined were invested with transformative social meaning. The country's World War I bomber was named after Ilia Moromets, the Russian fairy-tale giant who awoke after forty years in possession of colossal strength.

With the sudden popularity of science fiction translated from the West (works by Edward Bellamy, Jules Verne, H. G. Wells), leading Russian writers began to create their own other-planetary worlds, as the first successes of airborne flight propelled imagination into outer space. Interplanetary travel was a preferred form of social utopian expression. Aleksandr Bogdanov's two-volume epic, Red Star (1908) and Engineer Menni (1913), anticipated history by describing a Marxist-communist society existing on Mars.

Maxim Gorky developed a theory of god-building (bogostroitel'stvo) whereby the masses would become God, creators of miracles and immortal. The prewar generation discovered and made famous the writings of Nikolai Fedorov, a nineteenth-century librarian whose cosmological speculations predicted an immortal humankind comprised of the technologically resurrected bodies of the dead, inhabiting a socially harmonious interplanetary space.

Fedorov envisioned a moral universe transformed through social-utopian applications of science (cloud-seeding, solar heat, travel by electromagnetic energy). Among his supporters were a number of intellectuals, including Konstantin Tsiolkovskii, who became the founding scientist of Soviet rocketry.

All kinds of social fantasies were sparked by the new industrial technologies. The futurist poetry of Aleksei Gastev, a metal worker and political agitator before the war, described with passionate enthusiasm the new industrial machines as an animate force with human beings their collectivized extension.

Vasilii Kamenskii, who was himself an aerobatics pilot, composed "ferro-concrete poems" out of words suspended like airplanes in space that influenced Kazimir Malevich's suprematist paintings of geometric forms suspended in space. 

Artists of the avant-garde gave expression to the changed anthropology of modern life in forms and rhythms that left the perceptual apparatus of the old world triumphantly behind. The Bolshevik Revolution appropriated these utopian impulses by affirming them and channeling their energy into the political project. Liberating visions became legitimating ones, as fantasies of movement through space were translated into temporal movement, reinscribed onto the historical trajectory of revolutionary time. The case of the artistic avant-garde is particularly illuminating, because it was here that the political and cultural definitions of revolution became most visibly, if problematically, intertwined.18 As a movement, Russian avant-garde art predated the Revolution, which ended its bohemian status by granting it official recognition. These artists heralded the new artistic avant-garde, which predated the Revolution and later received official recognition, heralding the new artistic avant-garde.

Then, eight sections of autonomous words and phrases, including: "Matisse/Luxemburg Gardens/Pikas [Picasso]/ peace / air words/light music/youths side by side / fragrant days/staircase/Arabian cafe/ Cézanne," etc.

The often-cited 1913 "Manifesto of Russian Futurists and Rayonists [Rayists]" praised the greatness of the present epoch, "one that has known no equal in the entire history of the world," in terms of "the whole brilliant style of modern times—our trousers, jackets, shoes, trolleys, cars, airplanes, railways, grandiose steamships," 19 objects in motion that "embody a mass of moments in time" (in Malevich's words),20 rather than political actions that progress through time. When the avant-garde proclaimed "The future is our only goal,"21 they were expressing a desire to break radically from past art in its traditional forms, but what was to come remained an open category. Indeed, the artworks were themselves openings in both a temporal and a spatial sense. Vladimir Tatlin's prerevolutionary "counterreliefs" were objects composed of metal and wood hung unframed as "real materials in real space" in order to eliminate the separation of art from life and destroy the "perfect, private " 

. . and eternal world of the painting."22 If Tatlin celebrated the forms and materials of modern objects for their own sake, Malevich sought to express what was eternal within them. The latter boasted of having transcended space, advancing toward eternity rather than toward any temporally located goal. "Hurry up and shed the hardened skin of centuries, so that you can catch up with us more easily,"23 he wrote in 1915, the year his pathbreaking geometrical painting Black Square was exhibited in the "Last Futurist Exhibition, 0.10."24 But it was not along a linear course of history that he was racing. Rather, it was into a realm of metaphysical essences intuited out of the new technologies and urban perceptions, and consisting of pure forms and color masses situated within mystic-utopian geometries of space. Malevich's support for the Bolshevik Revolution did not alter his commitment to the "freedom" of "non-objectivism," which he called suprematism, as his paintings of squares developed systematically from black, to red, to the extreme-minimalist White Square on White Background of 1918.25 He understood these artistic forms as going beyond "our endless progress" into an extraterritorial realm.26 As he claimed in 1919: "I have torn through the blue lampshade of color limitation and come out into the white. After me comrade aviators sail into the chasmI have set up the semaphores of suprematism. . . . Infinity is before you."27 The "time" of the cultural avant-garde is not the same as that of the vanguard party.28 These artists’ practices interrupted the continuity of perceptions and estranged the familiar, severing historical tradition through the force of their fantasy. Progress for the early Russian modernists meant stepping out of the frame of the existing order—whether toward the "beautiful East," back to the "primitive," or through to the "eternal," no matter.29 The effect was to rupture the continuity of time, opening it up to new cognitive and sensory experiences. In contrast, the party submitted to a historical cosmology that provided no such freedom of movement. Bolshevism's claim to know the course of history in its totality presumed a "science" of the future that encouraged revolutionary politics to dictate to art. Culture was to be operationalized. Its products would serve "progress" as the latter's visual representation. Once a certain cosmology of history was lodged in the imagination, even artists came to feel that it could not be otherwise. Artistic revolution came to be distinguished from political revolution, of which it was merely symptomatic. (Constrained by the historical goal, revolutionary culture became sedate, conserving a past that appeared to lead meaningfully into the present, eschewing new primitivisms that blurred the line of progress, appealing to the masses by means of conventional art forms in order to mobilize them for movement "forward" in time. The story, of course, is far more complicated than this condensed account implies. It was more than a decade before conventional art triumphed in the Soviet Union. Even then, at the height of Stalin's power, there was never a monolithic art or architectural style.30 But the special position of the party as the vanguard of history meant that the possibilities, through an open temporality, of an ungoverned cultural revolution as the path to < previous page page_49 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E1 %EB%.

2.8 Boris Korolev, maquette for a statue of Karl Marx, 1919 (left), to be compared with the statue of Marx by Aleksandr Matveev (right), erected in Petrograd, 1918. Korolev's statue was never executed, although there were no regulations of style for the monuments built under Lenin's proposal. Korolev was a co-director of the Moscow Union of Sculptors, to which Tatlin, as head of Moscow's Narkompros, assigned the task of awarding commissions for the monuments, so that his proposal had authority behind it. The stylistic radicality of his futuro-cubist design cannot be denied, but its very strength gives palpable evidence of the non-identity between the two movements, cultural avant-garte and political vanguard. Historical progress toward socialism could not be read easily into this statue, and the fact that its subject was Karl Marx hardly made the politics of the situation less problematic.31

A new society became one of the dead ends of history. Like so many of history's failures, it merits serious consideration, as it is not always the most progressive social practices that succeed in time, but rather those that impose themselves most violently. DMOOOOOOOOOO

There are countless possible stories about Bolshevik revolutionary culture, and many have been told. While heroes and villains abound in these narrations, few have engaged this site of the temporary convergence of political and cultural avant-gardes in order to rethink both art and politics in a revolutionary mode. Here the concept of time may be useful, providing a key to unlock the antagonistic embrace of art and politics in this century—the repeating scenarios of art succumbing to politics or, alternatively, politics aestheticized as art—freeing both to relate differently to one another. Let us look at the historical events in more detail.

The early Soviet state supported a variety of artistic tendencies, resulting, indeed, in an "ambiguous pluralization" of intellectual life.32 Proletarian cultural organizations—theater workshops, art studios, and literary circles—had been founded along with militias and workers’ councils at the factory and local levels before the Revolution. In 1917, these groups were centralized as Proletkult under the Marxist intellectual leadership of Bogdanov, but this organization was and remained separate from both the party and the state.33 Funding was provided for a variety of individual artists. The mystico-primitivist Marc Chagall was appointed director of the Vitebsk art school despite the apolitical nature of his paintings, which depicted Judaic and folkloric themes.34 The painter and musician Mikhail Matiushin received state funding while continuing to paint nature-inspired, abstract canvases emphasizing color and structural clarity that were, he claimed, a form of optical science.35 Pavel Filonov founded his own school, "analytical painting," depicting forms of the material world and its organic processes in an effort to make visible what was in principle invisible, while affirming his loyalty to the Bolshevik regime due to his sincere belief in the "democratization of the arts" that Marxists proclaimed—although what this meant was far from clear.36 Fitzpatrick has written: "All Marxist intellectuals agreed, without even thinking about it, that proletarian culture had little or nothing to do with observable popular lower-class habits and cultural tastes. 

But that fact did not translate into consensus concerning a positive program. Although there was a self-conscious search for proletarian recruits, the artists remained a separate group, or better, separate groups, endorsing the criterion of "social usefulness" (which distinguished their work from the bourgeois program of 'art pour l'art) without toeing any common artistic line. Among those vying for cultural hegemony (and state funding), there were key differences in previous page 51 [21.01.2009 0:32:08] page 52 < previous page page 52 next page > Page 52 2.10 Mikhail Matiushin, Movement in Space, 1918. file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E1 %E. ..OCatastrophe/0262024640/files/page_52.html (1 u3 2) [21.01.2009 0:32:09] page 52 2.11 Boris Iakovlev, Transport Is Being Laid, 1923. < previous page page 52 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%FB%EB%20%EF%F3%E1 %E. ..OCatastrophe/0262024640/files/page_52.html (2 u3 2) [21.01.2009 0:32:09] page 53 < previous page page_53 next page > Page 53 2.12 Nikolai Nikonov, Entry of the Red Army in 1920 into Krasnoiarsk, 1923.

The AKhRR (Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia) was a large umbrella organization of easel painters founded in 1922 in opposition to the avant-garde's rejection of representational art. Its expressed goal was to document the "revolutionary impulse of this great moment of history" by depicting themes of industrialization, the October Revolution, and the Civil War.38 Connecting to the nineteenth- century populist tradition of the Peredvizhniki (itinerants), these artists adhered from the beginning to a "realist" style of easel painting, defended in the postrevolutionary era for______ 41 The rivalry between Malevich and Tatlin, which dated back to the pre-revolutionary period, was not merely personal but based on different ideas of artistic truth. 42 Just what constituted "communist" artistic practice was an issue fiercely debated among the master artists of the avant-garde and their students. They formed schools that included the suprematist-oriented UNOVIS group (Affirmers of the New Art) founded by Malevich and Lissitzky in Vitebsk in 1920;43 the constructivist group founded in 1921 by Aleksandr Rodchenko and Varvara Stepanova at INKhUK (Institute of Artistic Culture) in Moscow;44 various groups in the architecture, ceramics, metalwork, and textile faculties at Moscow's VKhUTEMAS (Higher Artistic-Technical Workshops, which replaced the State Free Art Studios in 1920); artists at Petrograd's GINKhUK (State Institute of Artistic Culture) directed by Nikolai Punin and later Malevich (where Tatlin and Filonov also taught); and the anti-hierarchical, masterless OBMOKhU (Society for Young Artists) at Moscow's First Free State Art Studios, whose members specialized in posters and agitational design, working as a group "without a supervisor" in order, in their words, "to combat the artists in authority who exploit young talents."45 Debates among the "futurists," as Lenin called all of these experimental groups, were waged on numerous issues, but they shared a general tendency in their move away from art—particularly away from oil painting—and into "life," the lived experience of the everyday. They understood their work not as documenting the revolution but as realizing it, serving (and also leading) the proletariat in the active building of a new society. Constructivists, suprematists, and others of the avant-garde turned to "production art," applying their earlier formal and technical innovations to the design of everyday objects and architectural spaces that the masses would produce and use.46 Although production art was variously practiced, it provided the sense of a shared political task.47 "The proletariat will create new houses, new streets, new objects of everyday life," wrote Nikolai Punin as early as 1918: "Art of the proletariat is not a holy shrine where things are lazily regarded, but work, a factory which produces new artistic things."48 Vladimir Maiakovskii spoke of making "the streets .. . our brushes and the squares our palettes."49 The avant-garde turned to commercial and useful forms such as fabric design, children's books, journal covers, advertisements, theater sets, porcelain design, photo-and cine-montage. The UNOVIS group, which described themselves as collective creators of a "new utilitarian world of things," was commissioned by the city of Vitebsk to apply suprematist design to signboards, street decorations, buildings, interior decors, trams, and even ration cards.50 Lissitzky recruited the suprematist square as protagonist in a children's book. Popova applied it to costume design. Tatlin designed and produced workers' clothing (a coat and a suit) in five variants and an economical oven, establishing contacts with the Novyi Lessner factory in Petrograd to develop his idea of the "artist-constructor."51 The constructivists' program of 1921 stated explicitly that artists should enter the factory. Rodchenko wrote: "All new approaches to art arise from technology and engineering and move toward organization and construction"; "real construction is utilitarian necessity." The avant-garde artists claimed that their revolution in art had already happened in 1914, when they emphasized "material, volume, and construction" as its basis. Lissitzky went so far as to declare that communism, which had "set human labour on the throne," would have to "remain behind," because its reign of labor would be overtaken by those marching under suprematism's "square pennant of creativity." Malevich claimed for his UNOVIS group the status of a "party" in art shadowing the official one, with UNOVIS branches in other art schools both domestic and abroad, and with his own Vitebsk school as the "Central Creative Committee." The slippage in the meaning of words borrowed from the discourse of the political vanguard and applied to that of artistic practice was a strategy for gaining power in terms of the new idiom of cultural hegemony.

The avant-garde's revolutionary enthusiasm threatened the political vanguard because it challenged the latter on its own discursive ground. But even the boldest among the artists acquiesced to a chronological perception of revolution that acknowledged that the party had set the terms of the debate.

In 1920-1921, Lenin campaigned to "quash" independent cultural organizations such as Proletkult (which had become a mass movement of half a million during the Civil War) because it "sought to operate autonomously, beyond the bounds of the party," and he expressed a "growing impatience" with avant-garde movements of "futurist art which had infiltrated Proletkult groups. Page 58:

57 I am arguing that Lenin's hostility was not so much a matter of taste as one of time.58 Lenin shared with the avant-garde artists the elitist conception that a minority would be in "advance" of the rest of the population and hence would need to lead them. And he was a maverick among Marxists in his belief that political movements could speed up the course of history.59 But this voluntarism only increased his sense of the constraining force of history when it came to cultural matters. In the wake of the devastations of civil war, the logic of Lenin's position was straightforward. The tasks most pressing in culture were mass literacy, technical training, and political education—particularly for the majority, peasant class. In this context, the projects of the avant-garde could indeed appear politically indulgent. As for the Proletkult groups, their impeccably Marxist commitment to the factory workers was to his mind naive, as was their optimism regarding the degree of mass enlightenment. In 1922 Lenin wrote in the margins of an article defending Proletkult: "but the peasants? . . . are the peasants building locomotives?"60 And regarding the alleged supremacy of "intellectuals, artists and engineers" within the proletariat, he wrote scoffingly, "arch-fiction."61 But his logic only underscored the temporal paradox that had plagued him from the beginning, the fact that this Marxist revolution, historically the most modern, most vanguard of events, had taken place in what he himself believed was one of the most economically backward countries in Europe. It led the Bolshevik regime to endorse a policy of economic modernization as the very definition of revolution. Only by speeding up this modernizing process could the embarrassing gap between the economic meaning of time and the political meaning of time be obliterated. By the end of the Civil War, after a brief period of social experimentation and despite the temporary concessions of NEP to private enterprise (that of the peasants in particular), industrial modernization was the Leninist meaning of "constructing socialism." All other definitions—democratic control (proposed by the Workers' Opposition), popular participation (proposed by the Kronstadt rebels), cultural creativity (proposed by Bogdanov as head of Proletkult), human self-realization (proposed by Lunacharskii as Commissar of Enlightenment)—were dismissed as secondary, criticized as left-wing infantilism, or condemned as downright counterrevolutionary.62

Page 59:

With a remarkably even hand, until his resignation from the position of Commissar of Enlightenment in 1929, Lunacharskii negotiated between the party and the various artistic groups, ensuring for the artists a continued space of creative freedom. The state organizations of Narkompros controlled all aspects of artistic culture, including art education (through admissions policies and teaching appointments); museum purchases (through the Museum Office, of Narkompros);63 galleries and exhibitions (within the Soviet Union and abroad);64 art journals (through the state publishing house Gosizdat);65 and commissions for every kind of specific project, from monumental statues to literacy posters, street decorations, and interior decors. And yet despite this enormous state control, diversity flourished among contentious and independent-minded artistic groups, creating, de facto, a cultural pluralism that went against the epistemology of the party. Taylor describes the "central dilemma of art and literature under Bolshevism" as the need to balance political commitment and artistic style. Lunacharskii, as head of the state institution of Narkompros, encouraged various artistic groups to compete in demonstrating their political and cultural legitimacy. This resulted in a pluralistic approach to art, with different groups uniting in supporting the Bolshevik regime.

Lunacharskii's policy statements, as a party member, reflected the Leninist position that art was to inspire the socialist project of industrial modernization, but it was not a replacement for it. In 1920, Lunacharskii wrote that art would remain "art" in the traditional sense, with the classics of the European past providing the foundation for "creating purely proletarian art forms and institutions."

Futurism and suprematism were corralled and brought back into line, specifically "the line of development of European art" that began with impressionism. In 1921, Lunacharskii addressed the Communist International, anticipating the socialist realism of the 1930s: The proletariat would continue the art of the past, starting from a healthy stage, like the Renaissance. The natural form of their art would be the traditional and classical one, clear and transparent, resting on healthy convincing realism and eloquent, transparent symbolism in decorative and monumental forms.

However, artistic practice could no longer attempt to disrupt the continuum of history as defined and led by the party. It could not challenge the temporality of the political revolution, which invested the party with the sovereign power to force mass compliance in history's name. The lost opportunity was the temporal interruption of avant-garde practice, which could have continued to function as a criticism of history's progression after the Revolution. Instead, it became the servant of a political vanguard that had a monopoly over time's meaning, a cosmological understanding of history that legitimated the use of violence against all opposing visions of social transformation.

The author's intent is not to produce another narrative of how Lenin and the party victimized the avant-garde, but rather to argue that conceptions of temporality have political implications. Blindness to this fact contributed to the historical failure of both the artistic avant-garde and the political vanguard. It is difficult to see this situation clearly, because the historical actors themselves did not. The terms "avant-garde" and "vanguard," which I am defining against each other, were not held apart with any rigor in the early twentieth century. In Russia at the time of the Revolution, they seem to have been used interchangeably, or just as often not used at all. It was only in the 1960s that Western art historians constructed retroactively an international narrative of the artistic "avant-garde," in which the Russian modernists figured as a critically important moment. As for the political "vanguard," Marx himself never used this term. Lenin, who put forth the notion that the party was in advance of the rest of the working class, developed this theory in What Is to Be Done? in 1902. He appropriated the (Russified version of the) French term "avant-garde" (avangard) to describe his minority, Marxist party because this was the term used among Russian Marxists in European exile at the time. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the two terms are not differentiated in all European languages. It is only in retrospect that their different times can be seen to matter.

We can present the philosophical problem more clearly if we look again at empirical history, this time focusing more broadly on the changing contextual meanings of the terms. Both words, "avant-garde" and "vanguard," originated in the West as spatial concepts within the military, where they referred to the leading edge of the army, a small force sent out in front to surprise the enemy. The terms came to be used metaphorically when they were transcribed onto the dimension of historical time. Avant-garde came into general use in France in the mid-nineteenth century, when it was applied to both cultural and political radicalism as both endorsed, in the spirit of Saint-Simonianism, the idea of history as progress. At the end of the century, in the climate of artistic modernism that was concentrated in bourgeois Paris and other Western European cities (where many Russian avant-garde artists and vanguard politicians, including Lenin, lived before the Revolution), the "avant-garde" took on a more specifically cultural meaning. Although most of the members of the cultural avant-garde would have described themselves as politically on the "Left" and aligned with history's "progressive" social forces, the term did not necessarily imply a political allegiance. It meant being alienated from established bourgeois culture (as a bohemian) or on the cutting edge of cultural history (as a radical), but it did not seem necessary to conflate these positions with an endorsement of any particular political party. It became an issue, however, at least for the Russian avant-garde, with the Bolshevik success in October 1917. As we have seen, Lenin immediately articulated this revolutionary event in terms of a cosmological temporality, situating the October Revolution within world history, and in his Plan for Monumental Propaganda he sought to secure this vision of a particular historical trajectory with the help of art. At the outset the Bolsheviks made a point of trying to engage the avant-garde in their cultural programs. And although the artists' response was generally to support the October Revolution, their situation was both intellectually and existentially ambiguous. Many of the leading avant-garde artists were explicitly anarchist in their political statements. This was particularly true in the spring of 1918, when, under pressure of the renewed war with Germany, the Leninist leadership was cracking down on anarchism.83 There was considerable unease among radical artists, including Malevich, Tatlin, and Maiakovskii, about the costs for creative freedom of collaborating too closely with any state organizations, including the new ones. It is here that the politics of conflicting temporalities becomes important. Precisely the intellectual prejudice of history-as-progress led both artists and party leaders to assume that political revolution and cultural revolution must be two sides of the same coin. But when the October Revolution brought to history its scenario of proletarian class rule, the logic of what constituted "progressive" art became intellectually confused and politically controversial. The avant-garde artists—suprematists, rayists, and futurists—were clearly the most "revolutionary" in terms of their break with traditional artistic practice. But did this prove their clairvoyance as anticipatory of the proletarian culture, or was it, on the contrary, a sign of historical decadence, connecting them fatally to late bourgeois, European modernism, which it was now clear was not the harbinger of socialist revolution? In winning this battle, defining < previous page page_61 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E1 %EB%...%20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_61.html [21.01.2009 0:32:19] page_62 < previous page page_62 next page > Page 62 its rightful place within the historical continuum of art, avant-gardism lost its credibility as a revolutionary strategy in its own right and was reduced in the Soviet story to a historical moment within "art's" development.84 The avant-garde's claim of being the historical destination of art might indeed be accommodated within the cosmological temporality of the party, but by this same gesture its "truth" was historicized. Already by the mid-1920s, the avant-garde of suprematism and futurism was spoken of in Russia as passé. All art that was not going in the direction of the party was historically "backward," bourgeois rather than proletarian, and hence ultimately counterrevolutionary. Once artists accepted the cosmological time of the political vanguard, it followed that to continue to be revolutionary in a cultural sense meant glorifying the successes of the party and covering over its failures. And this entailed a complete reversal of art's experiential effect; art was no longer to inspire imagination in a way that set reality into question but, rather, to stage affirmative representations of reality that encouraged an uncritical acceptance of the party's monopolistic right to control the direction of social transformation. <>< MO SOOO OOOO SD It could be argued that despite the constructivist call for art's entry into social life, the Bolshevik avant-garde was compromised precisely by attempting to hold onto "art" too tenaciously, that is, to hold onto a historical continuum of art that ran parallel (and was ultimately made subservient) to the cosmological continuum of historical progress.85 After the October Revolution, the mere gesture of refusal which marked the bourgeois avant-garde was no longer considered sufficient. Artists made the fateful decision, in facing forward rather than backward, to move triumphantly into the future alongside political power. The only argument was at what relative speed, whether, as Tatlin and Lissitzky claimed, artistic practice was chronologically in the lead of the Communist Party, or whether, as Trotsky wrote in 1923, art would generally find itself "in the baggage train of the movement of history."86 In acquiescing to the vanguard's cosmological conception of revolutionary time, the avant-garde abandoned the lived temporality of interruption, estrangement, arrest—that is, they abandoned the phenomenological experience of avant-garde practice.87 It is politically important to make this philosophical distinction in regard to avant-garde time and vanguard time, even if the avant-garde artists themselves did not.

The avant-garde philosophically understood, as a temporal structure of experience, is a cognitive category: it is "aesthetics" in the word's original sense of "perception through feeling."88 From an empirico-historical, descriptive point of view, it is enough for artists to call themselves avant-garde for them to be it (the Western art strategy). But from a philosophical viewpoint, the artwork itself must demonstrate this claim, within (and against) its historical context. Artworks, not artists, are avant-garde.89 It is the aesthetic experience of the artwork (or of any other cultural object: literary text, photograph, cinema, theater performance, musical recording, etc.—but also theoretical texts, including this one) that counts in a cognitive sense.

The power of any cultural object to arrest the flow of history and to open up time for alternative visions varies with history's changing course.90 Strategies range from critical negativity to utopian representation. No one style, no one medium is invariably successful. Perhaps not the object but its critical interpretation is avant-garde. What counts is that the aesthetic experience teach us something new about our world, that it shock us out of moral complacency and political resignation, and that it take us to task for the overwhelming lack of social imagination that characterizes so much of cultural production in all its forms.

The art of the Russian avant-garde prided itself in being "nonobjective," and was accused by its enemies of being "formalist," but it remained representational in the important sense that it was mimetic of the experience of modernity. Precisely through abstraction, the artworks gave expression to a human sensorium fundamentally altered by the tempos and technologies of factory and urban life.91 What was utopian in Malevich's art was the belief that the geometric forms laid bare by industrial production could, in their mathematical interrelationships, bring about a reconciliation between modern human beings and their new environment. Geometric harmony was seen as a model for spiritual and hence social harmony. Insofar as his artworks still have the power to evoke this sense in the observer, it is a mark of their political success. Lunacharskii criticized the constructivists for their pretensions of being engineers: "They play at being engineers . . . but they don't know as much of the essence of machinery as a savage."92 It is true that "for the most part Constructivist ideas remained on the level of designs only, and substantial industrial links were few.

forming a quasi-magical transformation of tools from instruments used by human beings into habitats that might shelter them. Georgii Krutikov's "City of Areal Paths of Communication" settled for nothing less than the domestication of the planet, while Andrei Burov imagined utopia at the opposite end of the scale: one urban building was to house all of life's activities as a micromodel of the world. Anton Lavinskii's proposal for a "City on Springs" was sheer architectural fantasy, celebrating the audacity of human imagination. These "products" of the avant-garde adhered to a different logic than machine efficiency or industrial engineering. They were dream images, expressing the wish for a transformed relationship between human beings and their environment. Becoming collective property through their multiple reproduction as image, they gave sensual representation to the dialectical convergence between revolutionary imagination and material form.97 This accounts for what Gassner has called the utopian surplus or supplement of production art.98 The point of this supplement was that it did not lose sight of why in a socialist society humans were making the machines: not to exploit nature but to enhance human existence within it. The goal remained palpable in the works of the revolutionary avant-garde at precisely the time that it was in danger of being forgotten by the political vanguard.

By not closing the gap between dream and reality, the artworks of the avant-garde left both dream and reality free to criticize each other. The fantastic constructions of the avant-garde could no more be a blueprint for socialist existence than a Five Year Plan can be for how economic activity actually impinges on human lives. Both are utopian representations, the forced actualization of which can have very dystopic effects. The power of art to change life is indirect. But so is (or ought to be) the power of political sovereignty. Once an urban design or building, once a policy or plan enters the interactive world of the everyday, its uses should be allowed and indeed encouraged to transcend the constraints of the creator's intent. Granted, this was not always recognized by the architects and city planners of early Bolshevism. They meant their fantasies to be realized in concrete form, however modified.99 And if it were not for the shortage of material resources they might more frequently have had their wish. But even in the cases when the projects of the architectural and artistic avant-gardes were realized, their transformation of the environment taught by example, encouraging change mimetically rather than by force. In bringing sensory form to utopian ideas, their "reconstruction of daily life" (perestroika byta) anticipated the socialist future without sacrificing the present. The manipulative strategy of bringing art into life relied on the mimetic principle of aesthetic analogy rather than instrumental domination or military command. Bodily pleasure and physical comfort were fulfilled, not postponed. <>< SOKO OOOO OSD It has become fashionable to criticize totalitarian leaders on artistic grounds: Hitler was like a movie director;100 Stalin attempted to make a "total artwork out of society. Page 66:

101 But is the lesson that political revolutionaries should not be artists, or is it that they should become better ones? Precisely by refusing "art" as a world of illusion and entering "life," yet true to its own logic that sustains an uncompromised, utopian supplement, the avant-garde may have something to teach the politicians. What if revolutionary political practice had to justify the imaginaries that it constructs in accordance with the logic of its own ideals? Rather than using society as a stage for illusion-filled action stories, daily melodramas featuring Class War, or Constructing Socialism, or Overtaking the West (while violent power remains hidden behind the scenes), a revolutionary movement would need to see itself as a stage, in full view of society, on which the multiple practices enacted by citizen performers provided visible images of democracy and socialism, which are social processes rather than historically realizable stages, too multifaceted and open-ended ever to be defined or realized completely. Unlike the "show trials" of the Stalin era, such performances would not have as their purpose the staging of the regime's own legitimation but, rather, conducting experiments in democracy or demonstrations of socialism, allowing the citizen audience to draw its own conclusions, becoming experts in the "art" of living with others. Political power needs to give up the fantasy that by monopolizing the means of violence it has a monopoly over what is real. Sovereignty is as imaginary as art; art is as political as sovereignty.

102 Revolutionary politics needs to take seriously the fact that democratic sovereignty represents the masses, and that political actions represent history by giving it sensory, material form. What then does it mean to represent the temporality of revolutionary rupture through armed takeover and protracted civil war? What limitations of social fantasy might be implied by this scenario of violenceor by the project of forced modernization according to the plan of a vanguard party? Both are based on a temporal conception that is theoretically impoverished and practically inaccurate. Social life in fact occupies a plurality of layers of time, from glacier-slow to lightning-fast, from inexorable repetition to ineluctable transiency. Such hybrid rhythms cannot be played out on the diminished space of a linear continuum, however dialectically that < previous page page_66 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E1 %EB%...%20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_66.html [21.01.2009 0:32:24] page_67 < previous page page_67 next page > Page 67 But all is not well with this model. Lenin claimed that this operational approach could be applied to making "history" on a collective level. Utopian visions, "castles in the air," are scientific, Lenin wrote, when they motivate a "new people" to realize a revolutionary plan. Historical actualization thereby becomes the criterion for the acceptability of socialist dreaming. It seems to give proof that the dream was no mere fantasy. But in the process, history itself becomes a dreamworld. The voluntarism of the vanguard party, including the arbitrariness of its revolutionary violence, is rationalized as history striding forward. Using the masses as an instrument for realizing the dreamworld of history, the armed vanguard "submits" to a conception of time that, so long as it remains victorious, legitimates its own rule. If revolution is the "illusion of politics" (Marx), it is the illusion of history that makes the latter seem real.

Of course, daydreams are salutary; we could not live without them. But when their logic, in compensating for the disappointments of today, becomes a "plan" that locks in future meaning, time's indeterminability and openness is colonized, and the utopian dream becomes a reality of oppression.

In the last days of the Soviet regime, dissident artists within the Soviet Union represented its past history as a dreamworld, depicting the crumbling of the Soviet era before it occurred in fact. For this generation, the moment of awakening replaced that of revolutionary rupture as the defining phenomenological experience. Exemplary is a 1983 painting of Aleksandr Kosolapov, The Manifesto, in which, against a martial, red sky and amidst ruins that include a bust of Lenin, three putti try to decipher a surviving copy of Marx's Communist Manifesto. The dreamer who is still inside the dream of history accepts its logic as inexorable. But at the moment of awakening, when the dream's coherence dissipates, all that is left are scattered images. The compelling nature of their connection has been shattered.

It is crucial to recognize that the end of the Soviet era was not limited spatially to the territory of the Soviet Union. The Bolshevik experiment, no matter how many specifically Russian cultural traits it developed, was vitally attached to the Western, modernizing project, from which it cannot be extricated without causing the project itself to fall to pieces—including its cult of historical progress. Those who at this stage of awakening attempt the task of political interpretation are not to compare themselves with revolutionary prophets. They do better to approach the dream fragments like soothsayers who read the entrails of animals before a battle, not to predict which army will win, but to decipher what forces of collective fantasy exist to withstand the violence of any army, aiding those forces by exposing the deceptive representations on which every army depends. "History" has failed us. No new chronology will erase that fact. History's betrayal is so profound that it cannot be forgiven simply by tacking on a "post-" era to it (post-modernism, post-Marxism). There is real tragedy in the shattering of the dreams of modernity—of social utopia, historical progress, and material plenty for all. But to submit to melancholy at this point would be to confer on the past a wholeness that never did exist, confusing the loss of the dream with the loss of the dream's realization. The alternative of political cynicism is equally problematic, however, because in denying possibilities for change it prevents them; anticipating defeat, it brings defeat into being. Rather than taking a self-ironizing distance from history's failure, we "we" who may have nothing more nor less in common than sharing this time would do well to bring the ruins up close and work our way through the rubble in order to rescue the utopian hopes that modernity engendered, because we cannot afford to let them disappear.

There is no reason to believe that those utopian hopes caused history to go wrong, and every reason, based on evidence of the abuses of power that propelled history forward, to believe the opposite. When an era crumbles, "History breaks down into images, not into stories."107 Without the narration of continuous progress, the images of the past resemble night dreams, the "first mark" of which, Freud tells us, is their emancipation from "the spatial and temporal order of events."108 Such images, as dream images, are complex webs of memory and desire wherein past experience is rescued and, perhaps, redeemed. Only partial interpretations of these images are possible, and in a critical light. But they may be helpful if they illuminate patches of the past that seem to have a charge of energy about them precisely because the dominant narrative does not connect them seamlessly to the present.

The historical particulars might then be free to enter into different constellations of meaning. The juxtaposition of these past fragments with our present concerns might have the power to challenge the complacency of our times, when "history" is said by its victors to have successfully completed its course, and the new global capitalist hegemony claims to have run the competition off the field. To be engaged in the historical task of surprising rather than explaining the present—more avant-garde than vanguard in its temporality—may prove at the end of the century to be politically worth our while.

2.2 Time Fragments Mythic Time

In time, it was the monumental figure of Lenin himself that, replicated throughout Soviet public space, anchored the revolution. His wife Krupskaia recalled that in the first weeks of Bolshevik rule "nobody knew Lenin's face. . . . In the evening we would often . . . stroll around the Smolny, and nobody would ever recognize him, because there were no portraits then."109 After his death, the predictable inclusion of his icon in the landscape of everyday life became the cipher of the Revolution. "Lenin corners" in the home replaced religious representations. Lenin statues decorated urban squares. Lenin busts adorned public auditoriums, Lenin pins were worn on suit lapels. 

These reiterations were meant to be material evidence that "Lenin is always with us," effecting the apparent elimination of historical transience by extending the recent past limitlessly into the future. Revolutionary rupture was transformed mythically into a permanent present.

Fragment 1: Mythic Time: A Chronology

January 25, 1924

When Lenin died, time stopped. Everything that could make a noise—factory sirens, steamship whistles, train whistles—sounded for three minutes. The noise was deafening. At 4:00 exactly, all radio broadcasts, all telegraph lines, transmitted one message: "Stand up, comrades, Ilich is being lowered into his grave!" Everything stopped everywhere in Russia for five minutes. Trains stopped, ships stopped.110

But the grave remained open. Embalming procedures had been used to extend the life of the body for the biblical length of forty days.111

January 26, 1924

Stalin made a speech of mourning at the Second Congress of Soviets, pledging to fulfill Lenin's testament and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship. He began: "We, the Communists, are people of a special make. We are made of special material. The Communist body does not decay."112

Days later the Funeral Commission chaired by Feliks Dzerzhinskii (head of the Cheka) made the decision to preserve Lenin's body indefinitely. The most modern scientific techniques were to be used to replicate the funeral rites of Egyptian pharaohs. (The four-thousand-year-old mummy of King Tutankhamen had been discovered in Luxor 15 months earlier as the highlight of a slow process of excavating his tomb that received continuous publicity world-wide. In jewelry and design in the West, motifs of ancient Egypt were in fashion.)

January 28, 1924

Stalin recalled being "disappointed" when first meeting Lenin at a Bolshevik conference in Tammerflors, Finland, in 1905. This "most ordinary-looking man, below average height . . . [was] in no way distinguishable from ordinary mortals": It is accepted as customary that a Great Man must arrive late at meetings so that members of the assembly may await his appearance with bated breath, and then, just as the Great Man appears, the people may start whispering, "Ssssh... Silence... he's com- < previous page page_71 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E1 %EB%...%20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_71.html [21.01.2009 0:32:29] page_72 < previous page page_72 next page > Page 72 2.31 Lenin on Red Square, May 1, 1919. ing." This ritual did not seem to me superfluous, for it is overawing and instills respect. How disappointed I was, when I realized that Lenin had arrived at the meeting earlier than the delegates and, ensconced somewhere in the corner, was simply carrying on a most ordinary conversation with the most ordinary delegates of the conference. I will not conceal from you that this to me at the time seemed something of a violation of certain indispensable rules.113

January 30, 1924

Lenin's widow Nadezhda Krupskaia protested publicly in Pravda: COMRADES WORKERS AND PEASANTS! I have a great request to make of you: do not allow your grief for Illich to express itself in the external veneration of his person. Do not build______ Page 73:

A. V. Shchusev, model of the wooden mausoleum for Lenin, 1924. As head of Narkompros, Lunacharskii supervised the design competition for a permanent mausoleum, soliciting ideas from architects, artists, and "every thinking person" in a four-year contest that was itself a propaganda event.115 Competition entries included designs for a twenty-story-high statue of Lenin, a rostrum in the form of a giant screw and two nuts, and a huge solid block that housed a tractor, locomotive, and flowing brook.116 In the end, the Immortalization Commission rejected all the entries, and invited Shchusev to recast the existing wooden mausoleum in stone.

I don't know how it happened, but the current temporary mausoleum over the grave of Lenin is, in its architectural form, the very image of a similar mausoleum (though in stone) over the grave of King Cyrus near the city of murgaba in Persia famous four centuries before the start of the Christian era. Kornelii Zelinskii, Lef, 1925117

2.33 Design variants for Lenin's sarcophagus by Konstantin Melnikov, who won the competition in March 1924
The design pictured in the center of figure 2.33 was Melnikov's preferred plan, "a four-sided elongated pyramid cut by two internally opposed inclined planes of glass that by their intersection formed a strict horizontal diagonal, thus breaking up the static rectangle of the casket into two lively acute triangles."118 When the conservative Commission selected a more conventional variant by Melnikov, the latter incorporated the design shown here into the prize-winning Soviet Pavilion for the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs (figure 2.34). The pavilion, built of wood in Moscow by peasants using the traditional Russian axe, became an icon of constructivism, as did Rodchenko's Workers' Reading Room and Tatlin's Monument to the Third International, which were exhibited inside it.

February 1924
Leonid Krasin (Commissioner of Foreign Trade) was brought in to supervise the permanent preservation of Lenin's body. He was a proponent of Bogdanov's prerevolutionary theory of "god-building" and was influenced by Fedorov's call for the physical resurrection of the dead. He had written in 1921: "I am certain that the time will come when one will be able to use the elements of a person's life to recreate the physical person... [and] resurrect great historical figures."119

March 1924
With the rising temperatures, "time did its work"120Lenin's body began to decay. Krasin set into operation a specially designed refrigeration system to sustain it. A team of scientists reembalmed the corpse using experimental techniques. The Funeral Commission was renamed the Immortalization Commission. 
Religious tradition merged with science fiction and technical innovation, conflating temporal difference. Artists of the avant-garde were called upon as mediators between the archaic and the modern in designing the sarcophagus and mausoleum. Malevich proposed a cube-shaped grave for Lenin on the day of his death. Tatlin wrote that the mausoleum should be a "triumph of engineering," holding huge numbers of visitors and containing an information bureau, radio station, and hundreds of telephones. Shchusev endorsed Malevich's cube form in a proposal for the mausoleum that pleased the Immortalization Commission. The execution of the design was stylistically remote from suprematism, consisting of classical porticos superimposed on a complex of cubes. It was hastily erected that summer as a temporary structure out of wood. Melnikov, a protegé of Shchusev, designed the sarcophagus in geometric shapes that could be read alternatively as modernist triangles or ancient pyramidal forms.

On August 3, 1924, Lenin's tomb was opened for public viewing. Boris Zbarskii, one of the scientists involved in the embalming process, told the [foreign] newsmen that the Egyptians had been able to preserve only the bodies of their leaders, and that the features of their faces were unrecognizable. Lenin, on the other hand, looked simply asleep. Zbarsky added that the entire cost of embalming the body of Lenin was only $7500, "in striking contrast to the fortunes which the Egyptians spent on the bodies of their Pharaohs, nobles and high priests."

"Lenin" and "Death" are enemies. "Lenin" and "Life" are comrades... Lenin lived. Lenin lives. Lenin will live. Vladimir Maiakovskii, "Komsomolskaia," 1924.

Prushevsky answered that the successes of higher science were unable to resurrect people who have decomposed. Andrei Platonov wrote in "The Foundation Pit," "Marxism can do anything. Why is it then that Lenin lies intact in Moscow? He is waiting for science; he wants to be resurrected."

In 1930, Lenin's sarcophagus (designed by Melnikov) was installed. In 1932, the Sculpture House in the Vsekokhudozhnik Commune, Moscow (architect: Georgii Golts), began the mass reproduction of Lenin statues. The permanent mausoleum opened as a monument to the First Five Year Plan. On November 7, Stalin viewed the Revolutionary celebration in Red Square from its top level. It became traditional for Soviet leaders to use the mausoleum as a reviewing platform and for Soviet citizens to queue up to visit the mausoleum, entering its dark depths to view Lenin's mummy under glass and bathed in an eerie light. The very point at which the idea of a political modernization of society terminates in a totalitarian mummified communism is marked by the mummy of Lenin. The mummy gathers the community together, shaping it in two general forms: a mourning line and an exalting parade in front of its dwelling place. The mummy of Lenin is the point at which modernization is terminated and the omnipresence of the Party is imposed.

In 1941, Germany invaded deep into Russia, and the mummy of Lenin was evacuated. It was returned without damage to the mausoleum in 1945. In 1949, the Bulgarian Communist leader Georgi Dimitrov "went to Moscow for medical treatment and was sent back mummified through the Soviet method." In 1952, the cadaver of Choybalsan, Communist leader of Mongolia, was mummified by the Moscow embalming experts of the Laboratory of the Lenin Mausoleum. In 1953, Stalin's mummified body joined Lenin's in the mausoleum.

In 1961, as a consequence of de-Stalinization, the corpse of Stalin was removed from the mausoleum and buried nearby. In 1969, the mummy of Ho Chi Minh, Communist leader of Vietnam, was mummified by the Moscow laboratory team. In 1976, Mao Zedong, Communist leader of China, was mummified by Chinese experts and put on public display.

In 1979, the mummy of Agostino Neto, Communist leader of Angola, was mummified by the Moscow laboratory team. In 1985, the mummy of Lindon Forbes Burnham, Communist leader of Guyana, was mummified by the Moscow laboratory team. In 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist, and the disgraced monuments of the Soviet period began to be dismantled. The Lenin Museum at Red Square, containing relics of his life, was shut down. The contribution of the state to the budget of the Laboratory of the Lenin Mausoleum was reduced from one hundred percent to twenty percent.

In 1995, the mummy of Kim II Sung, Communist leader of North Korea, was mummified by the Moscow laboratory team. This commission saved the embalming experts of the Moscow laboratory from bankruptcy. The laboratory team began to take private commissions for "ritual service" from Russian citizens, including murdered mafia members and wealthy "new Russians," who wished to be buried with the dignity of a chief of state.

In 1997, President Boris Yeltsin called for a national referendum in Russia to determine the fate of Lenin's body and suggested closing the mausoleum and burying Lenin next to his mother. The Russian legislative assembly (the Duma, then dominated by Communists) voted against any change to Red Square, however minor, and invoked the fact that UNESCO had classified Lenin's mausoleum as part of the "patrimony of humanity." At the end of the twentieth century, Lenin's mummy is still in place. The mausoleum on Red Square remains open to the viewing public. Page 80 Fragment 2 Reverse Motion

To those who may be unacquainted with the heady delights of the editing-table the sense of control, of repetition, acceleration, deceleration, arrest in freeze-frame, release, and reversal of movement is inseparable from the thrill of power. Annette Michelson135

When D. W. Griffith's film Intolerance (USA, 1916) was chosen to be presented at the first Congress of the Comintern in Petrograd in 1921, "the most glaring problem for the Soviets was the film's insistent theme that history is cyclical. Intolerance advances the argument that the same cycles of intolerance and injustice simply recur in different historical dress . . . epoch after epoch."136

In contrast, Sergei Eisenstein's film version of the Bolshevik Revolution, October (1927), uses the technique of reverse motion to represent the impossible desire of political reactionaries to turn time backward. Eisenstein described the opening scene:

"The picture begins with semi-symbolic shots of the overthrowing of autocracy, represented by the toppling of the statue of Alexander III... . The collapse of the statue was also shot in reverse motion: the throne with the armless and legless torso flew back onto the pedestal. Arms, legs, scepter and orb flew up to join it. The indestructible figure of Alexander III once again sat in state, staring vacantly into space. This scene was shot for the episode of Kornilov's attack on Petrograd in the autumn of 1917 and represented the dreams of all those reactionaries who hoped that the general's success would lead to the restoration of the monarchy. .. . Visually, the scene was a great success."137

When the statue of Feliks Dzerzhinskii (head of the Cheka and member of Lenin's Immortalization Commission) was dismantled after the fall of the Soviet Union, the pedestal was preserved for its historical value. Mikhail Tampolskii wrote in 1993: "Of what is the pedestal a monument, if there is no figure on top of it? The answer is, apparently, the stability of time, a stability completely autonomous of any hero or any event, simply stability as such. The pedestal without Dzerzhinskii is unique in that it continues by itself to designate a place of the accumulation of time as pure abstraction."138

Iampolskii connects this emptying out of time's meaning with the devaluing of paper currency in Russia, and ultimately with the devaluing of the masses themselves: "The disappearance of the stable ruble [he wrote in 1993] is somehow connected with the disappearance of monuments. . .. The special phenomenon of the inflationary crowd has appeared, consisting of masses of depreciated individuals. . . . Its emergence is closely connected with alter- Page 82, 2.44 Toppled Dzerzhinskii, Moscow, 1991. In December 1998, the Russian parliament voted in favor of putting the toppled statue of Feliks Dzerzhinskii back in its place.

Page 84, 2.47 Cathedral of Christ the Savior, Moscow, 1883. In the early 1930s a site was chosen in Moscow for the building of the Palace of the Soviets.141 The Cathedral of Christ the Savior, built to commemorate the Russian victory over Napoleon (and completed in 1883 under Tsar Alexander III) was dynamited in order to clear the ground. The destruction was filmed. After the Soviet Union collapsed, this short newsreel was shown in Russian theaters and on television "hundreds of times. One could say without exaggeration that this fragment today [1993] is the most shown piece of the Soviet Chronicle. In a significant number of films, the precise moment is shown in slow motion or repeated over and over . . . [as] perpetual . . . immortalized destruction."142 Construction of the palace began in 1939. It was interrupted when Germany invaded Russia. After Khrushchev's de- Stalinization speech in 1956, plans for the Palace of the Soviets were abandoned definitively. On the site of "two nonexistent buildings," the cathedral and the palace, a huge public swimming pool was built.143 The Moskva open air swimming pool .. . almost in the city centre, open all year, in summer and winter alike, is generally and on first impression considered to be a pioneering move of town planning, not to drive people out of the stone landscape, but to give them more bodily exercise, more nature, sun and air. The pool [is] a gigantic circle. .. . Swimming in winter, in the midst of an icy, snow-covered city, in swathes of steam reaching out to the street, is both fantastic and daringalmost like wanting to pull down the banks in Wall Street to make room for kindergartens.

Kazimir Malevich's late peasant paintings, though not contemporary, can be seen as a critical commentary on time itself. His last paintings before his death in 935 included personal portraits of his wife, a friend, and himself dressed in the anachronistic garb of the European Renaissance.

Page 89:
The term "Formalist" was considered politically damning in the Soviet Union during the 1930s. However, in the West, "formalism" was regarded as a valuable criterion for political art. Clement Greenberg's 1939 article, "Avant-Garde and Kitsch," argued that artists following the laws of art's intrinsic development were more politically radical than those working for instrumental ends. This position, called "apolitical politicism," became a weapon in the Cold War, with non-representational art being equated with democratic societies and opposed to the representational realism of totalitarian regimes. The Museum of Modern Art in New York became an institutional embodiment of this Cold War politics. The square, as a painted form, moved through the political landscape of the twentieth century, with its exile to the United States and eventual loss of revolutionary effectiveness. The original gesture of rupturing the historical continuum became a historical continuum itself. Artists produced a plethora of canvases as variants on the theme, a practice that intensified during the Cold War and reached its climax in the 1960s. The list of monochromatic square-painters (or rectangular variants thereof) reads like a Who's Who of the American school of abstract art: Josef Albers, Ellsworth Kelly, Brice Marden, Agnes Martin, Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt, Robert Ryman, Frank Stella.

The decade of the sixties witnessed an explosion of artistic imperialism under the banner of "internationalism." As a form of U.S. Cold War cultural hegemony, black squares, yellow squares, red squares, etc., were painted by "avant-garde" artists around the globe.

Kazimir Malevich's Black Square, 1915, was the inspiration for Josef Albers' Homage to the Square: Silent Hall, 1961. Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid's project Circle, Square, Triangle, 1975, addressed "To Prospective Customers": "Take your choice, we can supply you, wholesale and retail, with individual eternal ideas Linked a priori to nothing, manufactured from the highest quality of domestic lumber and imported cements and painted by the hands of the virginal maidens employed by the enterprise of Renowned Artists of the Twentieth-Century Seventies, Moscow. A CIRCLE, A SQUARE, A TRIANGLEfor every home, for every family!"

Ad Reinhardt's Abstract Painting, 1959 (left), Painting, 1956-1960 (right), and Abstract Painting, Black, 1954 (center), were showcased at the retrospective exhibition "American Art in the 20th Century," Martin-Gropius Bau, Berlin, 1993. Maria Konstantinova's M.K.K.M. (Maria Konstantinova/Kazimir Malevich), 1990, also featured in the exhibition.

The painted subtleties of the square that so fascinate art historians (variations in size, texture, and design features) do not lend themselves to photographic reproduction, the major form of art's contemporary propagation. Overuse has caused the square to lose the mystical power that it had for Malevich in 1915. It has become a cliché, if not itself kitsch, and Robert Rauschenberg's parody hit a sore nerve when he painted his own square with house paint and a paint rollerleading Ad Reinhardt to scream in protest: "Does he think it's easy?" Cushioned by market recognition and financial success, the square has reached a comfortable old age. Conceived in the revolutionary turmoil of Russia at the beginning of the century, its fate, ironically, is to have become the recognized logo of U.S. "high culture" at the century's end. Avant-gardes have only one time, and the best thing that can happen to them is, in the full sense of the term, to have had their day... . A historical project certainly cannot claim to preserve an eternal youth protected from blows. Guy Debord, 1991

3.1 Brain-scientist couple, Cecile and Oscar Vogt, who made 10,000 cross-section slides of the brain of Lenin, pictured below with his wife Krupskaia after he became ill. An autopsy was performed on Lenin the same night as his embalming, lasting four hours and forty minutes. "Approximately halfway through the process Lenin's brain was opened, and the direct cause of death was ascertained. ... When Lenin suffered a stroke on January 21, 1924, a Large amount of blood rushed into his brain, much more blood than the sclerotic arteries had been transmitting. This pressure was too great for the brain's damaged vessels, and the walls of those vessels broke down, flooding the brain with blood." An official report of the autopsy was published the day of Lenin's funeral. One reader, a non-party intellectual, criticized it for conveying the message that "Lenin is only matter, nothing more than a combination of a cranial hemisphere, intestines, an abdominal cavity, a heart, kidneys, a spleen... ."1 The weight of Lenin's brain was 1,340 grams.

Ill DREAMWORLDS OF MASS CULTURE A Note on Method The next three chapters present a series of constellations constructed out of historical facts, theoretical speculations, and visual images. They provide a series of reflections on Soviet modernism as it connected to Western modernism, crossing boundaries between discursive terrains usually kept apart, trespassing among different academic domains in order to loosen the material from any exclusive possession. Although historically grounded, these constellations are not history in the traditional sense. They are concerned less with how things actually were than with how they appear in retrospect. They reshuffle the usual ordering of facts with the goal of informing present political concerns. Such constellations rescue the past, but not for nostalgic reasons. The goal is to blast holes in established interpretations of the twentieth century, liberating new lines of sight that allow for critical reappropriations of its legacy.

Chapter 3 Common Sense 3.1 The Ecological Circuit The brain, it must be said, yields to philosophical reflection a sense of the uncanny.2 In our most materialist moments, we would like to take the matter of the brain itself for the mind. (What could be more appropriate than the brain studying the brain?) But there seems to be such an abyss between us,______ Page 99:

The brain is the center of the nervous system, composed of hundreds of billions of neurons extending through the spinal cord to the surface of the skin. The nervous system is not contained within the body's limits. The brain is thus not an isolatable anatomical body, but part of a system that connects the individual organism to the environment, passing through the person and their (culturally specific, historically transient) world. As the source of stimuli and the arena for motor response, the external world must be included to complete the sensory circuit. (Sensory deprivation causes the system's internal components to degenerate.) The field of the sensory circuit thus corresponds to that of "experience," in the classical philosophical sense of a mediation of subject and object, and yet its very composition makes the so-called split between subject and object, which was the constant plague of classical philosophy, simply irrelevant.5

Page 100:

Lunacharskii refused to allow Luchishkin's picture, which depicted the desperate conditions of the Civil War period, to be hung at the "Art Exhibition on the Tenth Anniversary of the October Revolution," telling the artist: "Famine in the Volga region was a difficult experience . . . but we are celebrating our grand holiday, why cloud it with these memories?" Luchishkin hung it in the next (and last) OST exhibition, but reaction was so negative that he destroyed it.6 This painting not only recollected the past; it predicted the future. Within two years, Stalin's drastic policies of dekulakization and collectivization of the peasantry led to devastating famines in the agricultural heartland of the Soviet Union outside of Russia, particularly in the Ukraine and the Volga region to the east of the Ukraine. The effects on the non-Russian Soviet peasantry were of genocidal proportions. In terms of political temporality, this was the slow time of death by starvation. No report of the long famine was allowed to appear in the press. The very word was banned as counterrevolutionary slander.

Solomon Nikritin, Screaming Woman, 1928, from a series by that name. Nikritin was a member of the OST group of oil painters. The series was not allowed to be exhibited.

The critical power of avant-garde experience is fueled by sensory cognition. It does not depend on the medium of expression. Critical cognition may be produced effectively by an oil painting or a theater piece, and it may be totally lacking in a photograph or cinematic representation. Indeed, "factography" (the early Soviet term), as the technological potential of the camera, may make image representations only more convincingly deceptive. Whether camera image or easel painting, whether filmic montage or architectural design, what matters is that the image provide a sensual, cognitive experience that is capable of resisting abusive power's self-justification. Visual "art" becomes political in this way. It makes apparent what the phantasmagorias of power cover up. Such an aesthetics differs in meaning from aesthetics within modern bourgeois culture—and at the same time revives the oldest meaning of the term. Aisthetikos is the ancient Greek word for that which is "perceptive by feeling." Aisthesis is the sensory experience of perception. The original field of aesthetics is not art but reality—corporeal, material nature. Hence, "Aesthetics is born as a discourse of the body." It is a form of cognition achieved through taste, touch, hearing, seeing, smell—the whole corporeal sensorium. To be alive is to feel—pain as well as pleasure. It is the a priori condition of existence, the precondition for both culture and history. Let us resist Hegel's abandonment of physiology and follow the neurological inquiry of one of his contemporaries, the Scottish anatomist Sir Charles Bell. Trained in 3.7 "The Fifth Nerve," drawing by Sir Charles Bell, from On the Nerves, 1821.

Sir Charles Bell's watercolor of a wounded French soldier after the battle of Waterloo. He described the victim's injury: "Peltier, 3rd French Lancers. Belg. Hosp. 2nd July. Belly opened by a sabre. Immediately the bowels protruded. Before he was off the field he had two stools, and none since downwards. When brought into the hospital the third day after the battle, the mass was gangrenous." Page 102

The expressive face is, indeed, a wonder of synthesis, as individual as a fingerprint, yet collectively legible by common sense. Its signs and gestures comprise a mimetic language that often, against conscious intent, gives the truth away. What this language speaks is anything but the concept. Written on the body's surface as a convergence between the impress of the external world and the express of subjective feeling, the language of this cognitive system threatens to betray the language of reason, undermining its philosophical sovereignty. Hegel developed in cosmological proportions the idea that the movement through space of a victorious army was synonymous with historical progress (Lenin was his legitimate heir). Writing The Phenomenology of Mind in his Jena study in 1806, Hegel interpreted the advancing army of Napoleon (whose cannons he could hear roaring in the distance) as the unwitting realization of Reason.

Sir Charles Bell, who, as a British field doctor, was physically present a decade later at the battle of Waterloo, had a very different interpretation: It is a misfortune to have our sentiments at variance with the universal sentiment [among the British who won this battle]. But there must ever be associated with the honours of Waterloo, in my eyes, the shocking signs of woe: to my ears, accents of intensity, outcry from the manly breast, interrupted, forcible expressions from the dying—and noisome smells. I must show you my note book [with sketches of those wounded, friend and foe], for... it may convey an excuse for this excess of sentiment.

Bell's "excess of sentiment" did not mean emotionalism. He found his "mind calm amidst such a variety of suffering." And it would be grotesque to interpret "sentiment" in this context as having anything to do with "taste." The excess was one of perceptual acuity, material awareness that ran out of the control of conscious will or intellection. It was not a psychological category of sympathy or compassion, of understanding the other's point of view from the perspective of intentional meaning, but, rather, physiological—a sensory mimesis, a response of the nervous system to external stimuli which was "excessive" because what he apprehended resisted intellectual comprehension. History as the ruin of nature could not be given meaning. The category of rationality could be applied to these physiological perceptions only in the sense of rationalization.

Walter Benjamin on World War I: "A generation that had gone to school on a horse-drawn streetcar now stood under the open sky in a countryside in which nothing remained unchanged but the clouds, and beneath these clouds, a field of force of destructive torrents and explosions, was the tiny, fragile human body."

"This immense wooing of the cosmos was enacted for the first time on a planetary scale, that is, in the spirit of technology. But because the lust for profit of the ruling class sought satisfaction through it, technology betrayed man and turned the bridal bed into a bloodbath."

Henry Ford on mass production: The production of the Model T required 7,882 distinct work operations, but, Ford noted [in his 1923 autobiography], only 12% of these tasks required "strong, able-bodied, and practically physically perfect men." Of the remainder, "we found that 670 could be filled by Legless men, 2,637 by one-legged men, two by armless men, 715 by one-armed men and ten by blind men."

Shock
Walter Benjamin's understanding of modern experience was neurological. It centered on shock. Benjamin wanted to investigate the "fruitfulness" of Freud's hypothesis, that consciousness patries shock by preventing it from penetrating deep enough to leave a permanent trace on memory, by applying it to "situations far removed from those which Freud had in mind." Freud was concerned with war neurosis, the trauma of "shell shock" and catastrophic accident that plagued soldiers in World War I. Benjamin claimed that this battlefield experience of shock had become "the norm" in modern life.

Perceptions that once occasioned conscious reflection were now the source of shock impulses which consciousness must parry. Nowhere was this defensive reflex more apparent than in the factory, where (Benjamin cited Marx) "workers learn to coordinate their own 'movements to the uniform and unceasing motion of an automaton.’ " Independently of the worker's volition, the article being worked on comes within his range of action and moves away from him just as arbitrarily." Exploitation was here to be understood as a cognitive category, not an economic one. The factory system, injuring every one of the human senses, paralyzed the imagination of the worker, whose labor was "sealed off from experience"; memory was replaced by conditioned response, learning by "drill," skill by repetition: "practice counts for nothing." Under conditions of modern technology, the aesthetic system undergoes a dialectical reversal. The human sensorium changes from a mode of being "in touch" with reality into a means of blocking out reality. Aestheticssensory perception becomes anaesthetics, a numbing of the senses' cognitive capacity that destroys the human organism's power to respond politically even when self-preservation is at stake. Someone who is "past experiencing,” writes Benjamin, is "no longer capable of telling . . . proven friend . . . from mortal enemy."

The sensory experience of modern labor cannot be seen as limited to capitalist production. If the Soviet regime was eager to adopt capitalist industrial production whole-cloth, how could it avoid importing the sensory shock that afflicted workers within it? Lenin thought he could import capitalist forms of labor without their exploitative content. But capitalist form is its content. Form is not formalist, as the sensory experience of factory labor clearly demonstrates. Assembly line production does not feel different to the sentient body simply because the worker is socialist. How, then, can one distinguish Soviet modernizing processes from those in the West? In investigating Benjamin's hypothesis of modern shock within the context of "constructing socialism" in the Soviet Union, one is struck by a temporal difference: for the proletariat of the Soviet Union industrialization was still a dreamworld when, for workers in capitalist countries, it was already a lived catastrophe. The enthusiasm for machine culture in the early Soviet Union has been noted frequently and described at length. But a crucial point often overlooked in these accounts is the degree to which the cult of the machine preceded the machines themselves. Machine culture under Western capitalism was adaptive to an already existing level of industrialization.24 In the late nineteenth century, Frederick Winslow Taylor devised his "scientific management" of labor, breaking down the work process into basic motions of optimal effectiveness, treating human beings as machines in order to get the most efficient production out of them.25 It was the factory owners, not the workers, whose interests were thereby served. The worker's adaptation to the machine was a work requirement, but it was also a mimetic defense. Human robotics functioned as a form of armor. As in nature, where an animal changes its physical attributes to mimic its external environment, the worker who turned her/his body into a machine with deadened senses was protecting against the shock of machine labor itself. Under the pretechnological conditions that existed in the early Soviet Union, in contrast, the cult of the human-as-machine sustained a utopian meaning.26 Its ecstatic intensity in the 1920s, at a time when the factory workforce had disintegrated and the country was struggling simply to restore the pre-World War I industrial capacity, anticipated mechanized processes rather than being a defensive response to them.27 The Central Institute of Labor (Tsentralnyi Institut Truda, or TsIT), founded in 1920 to implement Taylorist work methods imported from the United States, was run by a poet. It was an experimental laboratory in the mechanized rhythmics of labor.28 In this still preindustrial context, human bodies practicing the rhythm of machines were like shamans practicing magic, mimicking a desired state in order to bring it into existence. Scientifically calculated body movements were the industrial-age equivalent of a rain dance. The institute's director, Aleksei Gastev, knew firsthand the monotonous tedium of machine labor. During political exile in Paris before the war, he had been a metal worker, and he understood capitalist exploitation in its physical, corporeal form. But in his proletarian poetry, he developed an ecstatic vision of this still painful process, done now by a global collective of workers, for the purpose of giving birth through their labor to a world of universal harmony and peace. A million hammers striking at the same moment would set the entire world vibrating.29

Lev Kuleshov's "action score" for a 1921 "film without film."31

Gastev acknowledged that only through "powerful inrushes" of foreign capital, amounting to "completely enslaving" Soviet industry to American, English, and German capitalists, could the transformation be achieved.32 Speed, standardization, and "technical spirit" were necessary.30 "Catastrophes" destruction and death were inevitable.31 The power of "machinism" would produce a new human sensorium of electric nerves, brain machines, and cinema eyes;32 and a global, mass body with collective movements, collective feelings, collective goals, creating one world brain in place of millions of brains. Granted that as yet there is no international language, but there are international gestures, there are international psychological formulae which millions know how to use. .. . In the future this tendency will make individual thought impossible and it will imperceptibly be transformed into the objective psychology of an entire class with its systems of switch-ons, switch-offs, short circuits.33 Machine culture, Soviet style, had its origins as the expression of a lack, so that even its brutality could be seen to possess a utopian quality. Only in this dreamlike context could poetry and production techniques converge so irresistibly, attracting dramatists, cinematographers, and choreographers as artists of the human body. Industrial labor became the model of bodily discipline for producing the new man as a creative instrument, fusing work and dance. In contrast, in the United States, mass production was pragmatically motivated, an accommodation with man in his given, imperfect form. The Soviet ideal in the 1920s was to combine the creativity of art with the exactness of science. There is no doubt that this opened the door for ideological justifications of exploitative technologies, that is, for "aestheticizing" politics in the bourgeois sense of the term.34 Yet it also promised an overcoming of the bourgeois splitting of mind and body, a return to "aesthetics" in its original cognitive meaning. With no sense of contradiction, Taylorist techniques were brought together in Soviet culture with artistic methods from disparate sources. Exemplary were theories of ballet and mime imported from Europe by Volkonskii and Gardin, who in turn influenced early Soviet cinema directors.35 The early theory of montage formulated by Lev Kuleshov compared the rhythmic articulation of the actor's body, a series of basic motions as expressive gestures, with film shots: both were segments of movement, the "combination of separate moments of action . . . unfold[ing] in space and last[ing] in time."36 Montage for Kuleshov was screen rhythm, and the self-conscious, controlled body of the actor was its universal model. As in Taylor's scientific management, each part of the actor's body was treated as an independent module that could be organized with other parts in complex poses. The same process occurred in cinematic construction: segments of film, like segments of bodily gesture, were, as Iampolskii writes, "signs which opposed one another and they make sense in precisely that opposition."37 Both < previous page page_107 next page > file:///E|/-=Y%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_107.html [21.01.2009 0:33:03] page_108 < previous page page_108 next page > Page 108 3.13 Technical expert teaching a peasant woman the fundamentals of industrial work in the 1930s. 3.14 Photograph (1926) of the construction of the Marx-Engels Institute, Moscow, designed by C.

In the 1920s, the influence of Taylorism and Gastev's approaches on Soviet culture was evident in various fields, including cinema, theater, and everyday life. The Experimental Cinema Laboratory of the Moscow film school, where Kuleshov took an active part, focused on the rhythm of montage and body rhythm. The dramatist Vsevolod Meierkhold developed a system of "biomechanics," treating the actor as a malleable object of emotional expression. The goal was to control the body by eliminating all superfluous and unintended movements. Stop watches and time clocks were used to help acting students pattern their actions.

In 1923, a theater critic, Platon Kerzhentsev, founded the League of Time, with Gastev and Meierkhold on the board (and Lenin and Trotsky as honorary officers), to promote temporal efficiency among the general population. The League's journal, Vremia (Time), encouraged the grassroots organization of 800 "time cells" within the army, factories, government bodies, and schools. The "Timists" carried "chronocards" to monitor incidences of time-wasting due to tardiness, wasted motion, lengthy speeches, etc., and encouraged "spontaneous self-discipline."42

There were two cultural receptions of American technology in the Soviet Union, one urban and the other rural. Henry Ford was not only the symbol of the "colossal productivity" of an unskilled, albeit disciplined, workforce; he was also the producer of the consumer item most coveted by the Russian peasantry, the Fordson tractor. By 1926, the Soviet Union had ordered 24,000 Fordsons, "a figure equal to about 85% of the total Soviet production."46 Ford became a folk hero, and peasants called their tractors "fordzonskas." They saw him as a magical persona and longed to gaze upon him personally. Ford's name was better known than those of most communist figures, excepting Lenin and Trotsky. Some peasants named their children after him; others endowed their new ‘iron horses' with human characteristics. An American business reporter in 1930 observed that Lenin was the Russian God and Ford his St. Peter.47 Benjamin described Moscow in 1926 as a city still playing "hide and seek" with the village.48 As late as 1932, an American businessman was "astonished at Moscow pedestrians jaywalking among the vehicles like peasants in country lanes."49 It needs to be remembered that "constructing socialism" was handwork well into the 1930s. At the building site of the model industrial project of Magnitostroi/Magnitogorsk (the steel plant/town modeled after Gary, Indiana), millions of cubic feet of earth were moved with hand tools. In 1936, two-thirds of all earthmoving work was still being done without mechanization.50 This was where unskilled peasants came to become factory workers through the trial by fire of "shock work" (udarnyi trud) on the construction brigades. Shock work, the favored organization form of labor during the First Five Year Plan, was not Taylorist. It was executed in rushes, or "storms," by teams of workers, and its origins were said to have been "the very old, rural, rhythm-setting work cry (vziali)." The goal was higher productivity through extra human effort without machines.51

Shock work's purpose was to break the norms of labor. The word "shock" (udar) has various meanings, including a blow or strike with impacting force in military, natural, and medical senses.52 The collective thrust of the shock workers gave a "shock" as the agents of historical change, "bringing the time of socialism closer."53 Their image was superhuman, rather than machine-like and nonhuman. They produced the shock of modernity rather than parrying its effects. At the same time, they bore the brunt of the attack on their own bodies, as shock work entailed physical sacrifice and exhaustion for the sake of the collective goal.

Beginning in 1929, the authorities promoted shock work through campaigns for "socialist competition," where one factory, shop, or brigade was "challenged" by another to accomplish more in less time.57 This was a passionately emotional affair involving team spirit, daily drama, and heroic achievement. Shock workers, whose experience bears a striking resemblance to today's professional athletes, seem to have been genuinely exhilarated by the overexertion, and as exhausted as their machines as a result.

In 1929, Pravda suggested that an ideal socialist community be built outside of Moscow, a proposal that turned into the "Green City" competition.58 Green City was to be a recreational, collective space not devoted to production. The competition proved embarrassing, however, as some of the best-known architects suggested environments that, as compensatory relief from the strains of production, were so antithetical to the socialist work world as to imply a radical criticism of it. The constructivist architect Moisei Ginzburg and his student Mikhail Barshch submitted an entry that articulated leisure space in anarcho-individualist terms, stressing privacy, voluntarism, and lack of conformity—the antithesis of the collective values of socialist production. Their entry was a linear city, based on the "ribbon scheme" file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%FE%EB%20%EF V%F3%E1 YEB%. Page 113

The goal was not efficiency but "the flowering of human personality."60 Konstantin Melnikov's Green City proposal was collectivist enough. He designed a retreat with hotels rather than private homes, combining private entries and living spaces with communal kitchens and large common corridors where people could meet and socialize, reminiscent of the nineteenth-century phalansteries proposed by the French utopian theorist Charles Fourier.61 But the plan's structuring of leisure space was implicitly critical despite its collectivism. Frederick Starr writes: "Melnikov quite correctly began with the assumption that members of the overworked laborforce were exhausted. The recently lengthened working day, combined with the acute housing shortage and the introduction of rationing in 1929, pushed urban workers to the limit of their physical and psychological endurance."62

The space was designed to provide "temporary respite for workers brought there on a rotating basis from teeming Moscow. His Green City would offer relief by placing industrial laborers in a direct and intimate relationship with the primary forces of nature. All forests were to be carefully pruned so as to combine sunlight and fresh air in ratios most beneficial for those walking through them. Specially constructed solar pavilions were to be erected in open areas to enable sallow mill-workers to expose their bodies to the concentrated rays of the sun, even in winter."63 Melnikov's solutions highlighted ecological concerns that were totally absent from the mentality of Stalinist industrialization. "Energy for the city's needs would be drawn exclusively from the wind, and... [in an] allusion to Fourier, 3.19 Konstantin Melnikov, plan for Green City, 1929. < previous page page_113 next page > file:///E|/-=Y%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_113.html [21.01.2009 0:33:09] page_114 < previous page page_114 next page > Page 114 animals would be permitted to roam at will through a large sector of the town, so the weary Muscovite could imagine himself once more a primeval man roaming in God's peaceable kingdom."64 This retreat offered a curesleepproviding the techno-aesthetics for its facilitation. Melnikov wrote: "Man sleeps one third of his lifetime . . . twenty years of lying down without consciousness, without guidance as one journeys into the sphere of mysterious worlds to touch the unexplored depths of the sources of curative sacraments, and perhaps of miracles."65 The central hotel of the city was a "Laboratory of Sleep," a total sleep environment wherein all elements of the human sensorium could be effected. "All beds here were to be built-in, like laboratory tables; to obviate the need for pillows, the floors sloped gently to the ends of the structure. The walls were broken with great sheets of glass, for sleep would be encouraged at all times of day and would under some circumstances require sunlight as well as darkness."66 At either end were control booths, where technicians produced an entire synaesthetic system by using instruments to regulate the temperature, humidity, and air pressure, as well as to waft salubrious scents and "rarified condensed air" through the halls. Nor would sound be left unorganized. Specialists working "according to scientific facts" would transmit from the control center a range of sounds gauged to intensify the process of slumber. The rustle of leaves, the cooing of nightingales, or the soft murmur of waves would instantly relax the most overwrought veteran of the metropolis. Should these fail, the mechanized beds would then begin gently to rock until consciousness was lost. At this point, the natural sounds might continue or, at the command of trained specialists in the control booths, specially commissioned poems or works of music would be performed so as to obliterate any residual tensions or anxieties from the world of consciousness. Step by step, the worker would relax and his psyche would be rehabilitated by the combined forces of art and technology. Taken together, the building would be a "Sonata of Sleep," or, in Melnikov's pun on son, the Russian word for sleep, a SONnaia SONata.67 Melnikov sent a placard to the jury for the competition: "Cure through sleep and thereby alter the character... . Anyone thinking otherwise is sick."68 The much-debated entry received criticism ranging from "romantic" to "anti-socialist," the work of a "wrecker." "How, the jury wondered, could a major architect permit himself to apotheosize sleep at the very time when the nation was gearing up to transform life through work?" One of the few to express unabashed enthusiasm for Melnikov's proposal to manipulate completely both the physical and psychic environment was New York's ebullient showman "Roxy" Roth, who, accompanied by his architect, Wallace Harrison, and several advisors, visited Moscow in the summer of 1931 as part of a continental tour to gain ideas for the proposed Radio City < previous page page_114 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CDY%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_114.html [21.01.2009 0:33:10] page_115 < previous page page_115 next page > Page 115 3.20 Konstantin Melnikov, "Laboratory of Sleep" for the Green City, 1929. 3.21 Konstantin Melnikov, solar pavilion for the Green City, 1929, first variant. Music Hall. Melnikov recalled meeting with the delegation just as he was completing work on the SONnaia SONata. Roth had been directed to Melnikov because of the many auditoriums the Russian had recently designed for workers' clubs, but it was the SONnaia SONata that immediately caught Roth's imagination. He recognized at once the theatrical potential of Melnikov's fantastic control booths, and resolved to provide his own technicians with similar facilities for controlling the temperature, atmosphere, sounds, and smells in Radio City Music Hall. Within months, Roth's publicity department was bombarding the American public with the Melnikovian claim that "two hours in the washed, ionized, ozoned, ultra-solarized air [of Radio City Music Hall] are worth a month in the country."69 This U.S. entrepreneur had no trouble from the authorities in his own country in advertising the compensatory nature of his techno-aesthetic environment. On the contrary, making up to the consumer what was robbed from his or her life as a productive worker was the norm of capitalist culture. But precisely the rejection of this human cost-accounting was at the basis of socialist legitimacy, as well it should have been. By adopting the capitalist heavy-industry definition of economic modernization, however, Soviet socialism had no alternative but to try to produce a utopia out of the production process itself. In making this choice, the Soviets missed the opportunity to transform the very idea of economic "development," and of the ecological preconditions through which it might be realized.

The mastery of nature, so the imperialists teach, is the purpose of all technology. But who would trust a cane wielder who proclaimed the mastery of children by adults to be the purpose of education? Is not education above all the indispensable ordering of the relationship between generations and therefore mastery, if we are to use this term of that relationship and not of children? And likewise technology is not the mastery of nature but of the relation between nature and man.

Socialism necessitates a totally new relationship to nature. The technology of capitalism will not do to realize its aims. Capitalism organizes the exploitation of nature for private gain. Exploiting labor power is one part of this process, but not the whole. And just as capitalism will not pay for the reproduction of labor power (the social welfare bill) unless compelled to do so by state taxation, it will not by its own volition pay for the reproduction of the forces of nature that it consumes so voraciously.

Lenin was wrong to believe that technology is nothing more than the embodiment of objective science, hence value-free. Technology is the material manifestation of human beings' relationships with nature and among themselves. Nature can be brutal in its effects on the physical body. Hunger, cold, sickness, and death are its manners of assault, holding all of humanity in their power. It is not surprising that the potential of modern technology has prompted the dream of the domination of nature. But as humans are themselves natural bodies, the dream is self-damaging and ultimately self-defeating.

Marx knew as much when, in 1844 at the age of 26, he wrote that the overcoming of human alienation would necessitate a reconciliation between humans and nature, "the realized naturalism of man and the realized humanism of nature."

Such formulations all but disappeared in his later texts, which are expressed in the language of political economy, the legitimating discourse of his time. The 1844 manuscripts remained unknown and unpublished until the Marx-Engels Institute in Moscow launched an edition of the complete works of Marx in 1927, under the editorship of David Riazanov.74 A partial Russian translation appeared that year. The first full, German edition of these "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts" was published in Berlin in 1932, and the timing could not have been less auspicious. Riazanov had been arrested in 1931, victim of the general purge of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.75 Hitler came to power in 1933 and the German discussion of Marx's writings was quickly repressed. The fact that the 1844 manuscripts continued to have a strong underground existence in Europe, fundamentally shaping the tradition of (anti-Stalinist) "Western Marxism," is well known.76 But what of their influence in the Soviet Union? Riazanov belonged to left-intellectual circles in Moscow and no doubt would have spoken with colleagues of his discovery. Georg Lukacs recalled having access to the manuscripts through a "stroke of luck" in 1930, when he held a research post at the Marx-Engels Institute.77 Of course, not all readers of the manuscripts interpreted them similarly, and Lukacs remained loyal to Soviet Marxism despite his exposure. One can find in the "Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts" (as in all truly significant texts) evidence for < previous page page_118 next page > [21.01.2009 0:33:14] page_119 < previous page page_119 next page > Page 119 a multiplicity of arguments. Perhaps not until the ecological crisis of the end of the twentieth century does the young Marx's commitment to a reconciliation with nature appear to be not merely an expression of nineteenth-century romanticism or youthful idealism, but an intensely practical political concern. It is possible to piece together fragments of a different sensitivity existing within Soviet culture, one that might have found nourishment in Marx's early writings. Proving that it did is not the important point. Nor does it matter if historians have failed to find these fragments particularly significant. Even if not representative of their own time, they resonate with ours and, politically, that is what counts. <> <>< <M SOOO OMS Consider in this context the "utopian surplus" in the machine fantasy of the constructivists, precisely the element that made their designs open to criticism from a practical point of view.78 The constructivists' attempts to liquidate the distinction between artist and worker, not by the subservience of aesthetic pleasure to industrial instrumentality but by the interpenetration of these activities, provided images suggestive of a reconciliation with nature, wherein sensual (aesthetic) pleasure was understood as the goal, transcending mere physical need. Soviet sensuality was not nearly so closely intertwined with sexual pleasure as it was in the consumerist West.79 Indeed, there was a strong strain of sexual asceticism among the Soviet avant-garde, from Filonov to Malevich, from Fedorov to Rodchenko, and it was a broadly held Revolutionary sentiment.80 But a utopics of sensuality did exist as part of Bolshevik discourse, and it retained a strong hold within the culture. In the daily-life context of extreme cold, dark days, epidemics of disease, and wartime suffering in the Soviet Union, all of the attributes of organic "life" (zhisn)—light, movement, sun, air, water—had utopian appeal. Alla Efimova has argued that the sun-drenched canvases typical of socialist realist paintings were effective not because of what they depicted, but how. Their visual style of representing bodily comfort over death, health over illness, and plenty over want appealed to the viewer on a somatic level that had little to do with their ideologically contrived content. Efimova cites evidence from the contemporary texts, which emphasized the importance of making the viewer feel "real" alive and sensually responsive. Goals such as to "stir up" or "awaken" took precedence over purely ideological indoctrination. In this context of utopian desire, it needs to be remembered that socialism did deliver to the general population of the Soviet Union levels of public health, medical care, and leisure facilities that had never before existed, setting a model for the world.

Aleksandr Laktionov's "Letter from the Front" (1947) exemplifies the contrast between the fossilized and morbid romanticism of bourgeois culture and the organic, pulsating culture of "our" culture. Laktionov argued that the smell of such "romanticism" is the smell of death, and the dead spread miasma and poison to living life.

The utopian promise of industrialization was not only in mastering nature but in releasing its living force. Animation became a value in itself, and Soviet experimental cinema included experts in the genre of animation. Constructivist theories of "socialist" commodities provided alternatives to objects of consumption in their reified, capitalist form. These objects were seen as organs of human activity, adjusting to people's actions and expanding and dying with them. The constructivist objects were considered "comrades," and they were seen as a doubling of the human body, opposite to the capitalist commodity criticized by Marx.

Rodchenko's design for a Workers' Club displayed in Paris in 1925 exemplified the disgust towards the commodification of pleasure that typified the city's life. He deplored the way Paris's commodity culture nauseated him, citing examples such as "endless bidets" and "indecent" postcards. Page 120:

If you want, just "attach the wings and the wheels and take off, the house and all" [Vladimir Maiakovskii]. In contrast, according to Papernyi, Culture Two, the Stalinist culture, abhorred up-rootedness. Cosmopolitanism became synonymous with betraying the motherland. The architectural style of Culture Two was monumentally permanent. Huge blocks of buildings pressed their heavy weight into the ground, constructed to embody principles of hierarchy and centralization. Not only buildings but people too were tied down in place. "Beginning in 1932 the internal passport system was gradually implemented. . . . In 1940 the 'voluntary departure of employees from factories and offices' was forbidden once and for all." "The sight of a man lifted off the ground makes Culture Two cringe."

Exemplary of Papernyi's argument is the fact that in Culture Two even a monument to space flight appears unrelentingly grounded. No matter how high the pedestal or how soaring its shape, the cosmonaut seems to struggle against gravity in vain.

During the famine years of the 1920s, Vladimir Tatlin "cracked open the pavement in the yard of the Leningrad Academy of Art and planted potatoes." Anti-urbanism began as a movement on the eve of the First Five Year Plan. The architect Moisei Ginzburg suggested solutions for dwelling places that were implicitly critical of the social hierarchy fostered by urban centralization. In Moscow, there was an experimental center for the use of windmills as an energy source. A proposal was made for transforming Moscow itself into a Green City.

Taylor writes: Such attempts to "de-centre" the traditional city clearly implied a new type of relationship between city and countryside, hence between proletariat and peasant. These schemes attempted to incorporate principles of planning suggested by "nature," in opposition to the "hard" design principles of orthodox technology and science. They implied a high degree of mobility and a collapse of the conventional symbolic hierarchy in which power is vested in the city and handed out to the provinces. In this sense, they were "organicist" as well as "communist," and might well have had far-reaching consequences for Soviet life.

The fact that they did not have far-reaching consequences was a lost opportunity not only for Soviet urban development but for the history of socialism generally. While tons of asphalt were being dumped on the city streets to make them look like those of a Western capitalist metropolis (only bigger), Ginzburg and visionaries like him were nudged to the periphery. Against the current that glorified heavy industrial development (again, on the Western capitalist model), Tatlin undertook a pointedly individualist project that experimented with low technology, justified in socialist terms. It was necessary, he wrote, to produce "an original object which differs radically from the objects of the West and America," necessary because "our way of life is built on completely different principles . . . on healthy and natural principles. The Western object cannot satisfy us. Page 127 < previous page page_127 next page > Page 127

The ship lift at Niederfinau, Prussia, built 1925-1934, is a remarkable example of machine utopia. The elevator, which connects the canal systems of the geophysically disjoined Havel and Oder rivers, functions as a lifting mechanism for boats. The structure, standing 60 meters tall, exemplifies the machine utopia of a literate culture, as its appeal is fundamentally intellectual. The principle of its design, while technologically pathbreaking compared to previous lock systems, is as old as Archimedes' principle of displacing equal weights of water.

The lift was constructed in 1925 under the Weimar Republic and completed in 1934, the second year of the Nazi regime. It has been operating since then, showcasing the intellectual nature of the machine utopia. The elevator's tub, which remains constant at 4,250 tons, is balanced by a system of 192 counterweights and 256 wire cables. Only a small force of four motors, each of 75 horsepower, creates the differential that raises or lowers the entire structure.

This innovative machine utopia demonstrates the intellectual creativity and technological advancements of the era, showcasing the potential of engineering and design during the early 20th century. Each functioning of the ship lift moves 4,250 tons at 12 centimeters per second, achieving the vertical distance of 36 meters in five minutes' time. Utopian desire is evoked here in the calm balance between nature's laws and human needs. Human mobility and machine mobility are perfectly synchronized to accomplish a goal with the least amount of effort on both parts. The apparatus, rather than spewing smoke through phallic chimneys, opens up to take you in. Holding you gently in its watertub, it brings you slowly and quietly to a different space, raising or lowering you through montaged layers of air, water, and earth that follow each other like film frames, and lets you go again. This is human intervention into nature by means of its own laws, in order to facilitate human beings connecting with each other. Compared to the massive autobahn system that Hitler implemented in the 1930s, the environmental disruption is minimal. Although officially out-of-date with the arrival of highway technology, it has functioned without interruption since its construction. Canals are still an efficient means for moving people and goods. But highway systems move military units, and they are the state-preferred form of infrastructure.110 The shiplift at Niederfinau, now a tourist destination, is emblematic of a kind of machine utopia the developmental path of which was cut off abruptly when technology was brutally forced into the production of instruments of war.

The house where he had been born had been totally destroyed: "Only the chimney towered upward, like a modern monument of my childhood and youth, and next to it grew the spreading maple that had once been the little tree my father and I planted a few years before the war."111 Shortly thereafter, Sidur was wounded in battle. "For quite a long time I wavered between life and death, among shellshocked men with jaws missing and torn yellow flaps of skin on their stomachs."112 The side of his face had been shattered by a dumdum bullet from a German sharpshooter. Sent to the Central Institute for Traumatology and Orthopedics, where all those were treated who had lost their faces during the war (eyes, tongues, noses, chins), Sidur became one of the millions of cyborgs produced from the injured of this war. The side of his face was totally reconstructed. When he studied art in Moscow after the war, he chose to specialize in sculpture, the art that metamorphoses inorganic material into organic forms. In the intellectual climate of anticosmopolitanism, Sidur's training was traditional: "The name Malevich said nothing to me."113 He saw himself as the last of the species of artists in a tradition that reached back to the Scythians, Assyrians, and Egyptians, as well as to the archaic Greeks. And yet in his "underground cellar" in Moscow, the basement studio where he worked in increasing isolation from official culture, the thematics of his sculptures were persistently contemporary. A central focus was the transformation of industrially produced objects, salvaged from the refuse, into evocatively anthropomorphic forms. This practice was not original, having become a commonplace with Dadaism at the time of the First World War. But Sidur's work was uniquely serious in its fusion of the organic and the inorganic. It criticized social reality rather than the institution of art. One of his sculptures of industrially produced parts was rooted in his studio like a tree, so large that it could only see the light of day if the building itself were destroyed. His work encourages metaphysical reflection on the fact that industrial objects are themselves nature, and that this nature, twisted and bent into weapons, has been turned with fierce destructiveness upon itself.

To produce a mass army as a precision instrument of military attack was a conscious goal of Nazi culture, its own form of machine utopia. It had no counterpart in the Soviet Union.114 For all the brutality of Stalin's regime, the deliberate creation of an armored, mass army trained for offensive military purposes was not on the agenda. Despite propaganda shows of military preparedness in the 1930s, Stalin's war of industrialization, waged against time, was not a means for expansion in space.

On the contrary, criticism has been directed at his lack of military preparedness.115 Preoccupied with building a canal system studded with gigantic statues that glorified himself (and so grandiose that it could not deliver water rationally where it was needed), Stalin had not prepared the country to meet the Nazi onslaught.116 When it came, the blow was traumatic.117 The shock affected all aspects of social life.118 The Soviet death toll in World War II, military and civilian, is estimated at twenty million.119 The devastation was brought about by a devil's alliance between the technological brutality of Hitler's heavily armored army and the brutality of natural forces—freezing, sickness, hunger—that became the decisive weapon against the invading army itself.

In April 1941, Hitler brought total destruction to the Yugoslavian capital of Belgrade through a massive air attack; in June, he invaded Russia. Vadim Sidur recalled: "It began with Guernica [in the Spanish Civil War]," and after Belgrade "hundreds of cities in my country had to believe it... . And then we heard of Coventry, Dresden, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki."120 No country suffered modern warfare with such intensity as the Soviet Union in the Nazi invasion—until August 1945, when the United States dropped atomic bombs on two Japanese cities. With this act, announced by U.S. President Truman on the radio as the technological triumph of harnessing the nuclear power of the sun, the use of nature's energy to destroy human beings reached a qualitatively new level of barbarism. After the war in the Soviet Union, "catching up with the West" took on the meaning of developing equal weapons of mass destruction. "Art in the Age of the Balance of Terror" is how Vadim Sidur's work has been described.121 Not the machine nature of humans but the human nature of machines is brought to life in his sculptures. In one of his last series, the "coffin works," machine parts are assembled into animate, human forms, which he called "technological cadavers." Pressed into too-narrow coffins, they refuse to be contained. The nature in them, still alive, screams out in protest against its treatment by the human species. 3.38 Vadim Sidur, Coffin Man, 1972, from the series Coffin Art.

Page 134 < previous page page_134 next page > Page 134 Chapter 4 Culture for the Masses 4.1 The Masses Who are "the masses"? The word was launched in the modern era as a term of contempt. Its predecessor, the mob, was an unruly crowd occupying public space and threatening to destabilize the public order. The masses, however, unlike the mob, were not just an occasional social formation. With nineteenth-century industrialization and urbanization, processes that drew people together in large aggregates as a matter of course, the masses became a permanent presence in social life. In quotidian rhythms, they flowed through space as a spontaneous accumulation of persons, anonymous, fungible, and rootless. Organized, the masses are a physical force, a lethal weapon, and as such indispensable to sovereign power. In the nineteenth century, nation-states produced mass armies through universal conscription. And yet the explosive force of the masses could always turn against the sovereign agent of the state, which means that absolute obedience in the military was institutionally required. Mass society is a twentieth-century phenomenon. How it differs from mass military institutions is an organizational question. Whereas communication in the latter follows hierarchical lines of command, society as a mass is addressed directly. Modern media technologies are indispensable here, not only for the manipulation of the masses but for mass solidarity in a positive sense. Speed is a decisive factor in media effectiveness. Books are slow organizers, producing mass predispositions but seldom inciting direct action. Newspapers are known generators of mass action, and no modern political party of any importance has been without one. Placards, banners, and posters move the word out into the street, changing its nature. When words become part of a mass spectacle and integrated into the scene, the masses speak through______ Photographs of street demonstrations show words in this changed capacity, as identifying logos rather than logos-in-writing. How the words look matters. Letters take on modern shapes; graphic design gives the masses a revolutionary identity, and identity is the new means of mass organization. Mimesis replaces written argument. People become part of the collective by mimicking its look. Mass cathexis onto one person is a powerful organizer, but it requires at least the trace of physical presence: an image, a voice, clothes worn by, objects touched by, beds < previous page page_134 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E1 %E. ..Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_134.html [21.01.2009 0:33:30] page_135 Page 135 4.1 Vasilii Kuptsov, May Day, 1929. Why did only revolutionary futurism march in step with the October Revolution? Is it just a question of outward revolutionary fervor, just a mutual aversion to the old forms, that joins futurism with the proletariat? ... We maintain that there is a deeper link between futurism and proletarian creation. ... Take any work of revolutionary, futurist art. People who are used to seeing a depiction of individual objects or phenomena in a picture are bewildered. You cannot make anything out. And indeed, if you take out any one part from a futurist picture, it then represents an absurdity. Because each part of a futurist picture acquires meaning only through the interaction of all the other parts; only in conjunction with them does it acquire the meaning with which the artist imbued it. A futurist picture lives a collective life: By the same principle on which the proletariat's whole creation is constructed. Try to distinguish an individual face in a proletarian procession. Try to understand it as individual personsabsurd. Only in conjunction do they acquire all their strength, all their meaning.

The written word, in contrast, is decorporealized. The materiality of the text acts like a screen, prohibiting the author's physical attributesgender, age, ethnicity, attractivenessfrom being seen. As a consequence, a certain kind of mass cathexis is impossible, and although there have long been best-selling writers and popular political leaders, there were no heroes as media stars before the photograph. The voice as a means for organizing the masses demanded a new technology. Megaphones magnified sound by directing its focus, but still required the visual presence of the speaker to reach a mass audience at all. Spe______ Radio produced the "universal ear," the "newspaper without paper," Lenin said, "without borders."2 And although Lenin's speeches were reproduced on gramophone records for mass distribution, it was the live voice, the history-making event of its speech in present time, that carried mass-political charisma.3 When the voice was transformed into electrical surges transmitted through wire grids rather than the open air, the extension of the aural sense became limitless, as did the visual sense through photographic reproduction. Mass society was synonymous with this infinity of sense perception, achieved through the technological prostheses of the human sensory apparatus. The electrical grids over which the Soviet radio voice traveled were developed as a centralized infrastructure.4

In 1920, a plan for the electrification of the entire country was unveiled in an "elaborate show" to "enchanted listeners" at a congress of experts convened to consider it.9 Realism in regard to energy policy meant only that "dreams should not proceed faster than the ability to < previous page page_137 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_137.html [21.01.2009 0:33:33] page_138 < previous page page_138 next page > Page 138 4.4 Silent-film star Douglas Fairbanks at Wall Street, New York City, promoting the sale of U.S. Government bonds during World War I.

The kilowatt-hour was proposed as "an index of culture and progress." Not only radio receivers but cinema houses too required electricity, and cinema was central to the construction of mass society. Whereas the radio voice allowed mass identification with political leaders, cinema, traveling to towns and villages to meet audiences halfway, represented a moving image of the masses that allowed audiences to recognize themselves.

Such mirroring can be important in transforming the accidental crowd (the mass-in-itself) into the self-conscious, purposeful crowd (the mass-for-itself), with at least the potential of acting out its own destiny. But technologies that hold a mirror to the masses can also blind them, if their own image obscures the manipulating power behind the scenes. Consider the differences between several forms of the observing/observed masses: the carnival, the spectacle, the cinema.

The theatrical moments of the carnival, indifferent to technologies of mediation, are spontaneous, and the division between actors and audience is fluid. Roles constantly change as individuals are swept up in the rhythms, sounds, and fragmented images of the crowd. Social identities are transformed behind carnival masks and costumes. Social parody and mockery of power are permitted by the comedic logic of carnivals that causes antisocial emotions to lose their conspiratorial power.

"Revolutions are the festivals of the oppressed and the exploited," Lenin wrote in 1905. But the physical violence of revolutions separates them decisively from carnivalistic play. Whereas carnivals are ritual repetitions, revolutions are one-time-only events meant to change permanently the arrangement of social life. Revolutions disregard the carnival's social boundedness and overshoot parodic reversal, spilling out of the spatial and temporal constraints that are meant to contain collective discontent.

To be sure, revolutionary actions are full of symbolic meanings, and their icons produce a powerful visual culture. But they lack a full sense of spectatorship because their immediate audience is the very enemy they are attempting, violently, to annihilate. Only later, with events of revolutionary commemoration, does their spectacularity come into its own. In place of firearms there are fireworks; in place of secrecy, there is display. If revolutions break from the past, their celebration returns to it, dramatized with all theatrical effects.

On the first anniversary of the October Revolution, production of the celebratory spectacles was assigned to artists. Buildings were decorated with huge panels painted in a myriad (critics complained, a morass) of different styles, from futurist to folklorist. Natan Altman's design for Palace Square in Petrograd superimposed giant modernist forms upon this traditional architectural space. The masses, assembled under identifying banners, paraded through the commemorative displays like a moving exhibition in an enormous public street-gallery that included the latest in contemporary art. Monuments to the "fighters for socialism" were unveiled. Public theater was provided by a group of young, leftists artists, including Altman, Malevich, and Puni, who, employing a mass of extras, staged a reenactment of the revolution. In 1920, on the third anniversary of October, the festival atmosphere of the celebration was overpowered by the spectacle as a staged event. The Storming of the Winter Palace, produced that year in Petrograd, was a mass street theater involving ten thousand participants and an audience of ten times that who joined in the action at the climax of storming the palace. Natan Altman, design drawings for Uritskii (formerly Palace) Square, Petrograd. First anniversary of the October Revolution, 1918.

I set myself the task of changing the historical image of the square, and transforming it into a place where a revolutionary people would come to celebrate its victory. I decided not to decorate the square. The creations of [the eighteenth-century architects] Rastrelli and Rossi required no decoration. I wished instead to contrast the new beauty of a victorious people with the beauty of imperial Russia. I did not seek harmony with the old, but contrast with it. I placed my constructions not on the buildings but between them, where the streets opened the square. ... Only three vast paintings, almost the height of the buildings, were placed in front of the facades... a worker unfolding a banner... "He who was nothing will be everything," ... a peasant holding a banner... "Land to the Working People," ... a worker... bearing the slogan: "Factories to the Working People."

Staged performance of Storming of the Winter Palace, third anniversary of the October Revolution, Petrograd, 1920. Produced by Nikolai Evreinov, Aleksandr Kugel, and Nikolai Petrov, with designs by Iurii Annenkov, organized by Dmitrii Temkin.

Two weeks before 7 November 1920 there appeared over the gates of the Winter Palace a sign "Headquarters Organiser of October Celebrations." ... From first thing in the morning a queue of people stood waiting at the entrance to the Headquarters: drama schools, theater studios and clubs en bloc, representatives of military units, detachments of Red soldiers and sailors. This vast horde of manpower was sorted out in a special allocation section and everyone was given work appropriate to his qualifications in the task of staging The Storming of the Winter Palace. ... Dozens of producers, writers, stage-designers and technicians worked out an overall scenario for the production, splitting it into five parts: "White," "Red," "Bridge," "Square" and "Palace." ... The "Bridge" was a real bridge which joined the 64 metre long Red and White platforms, a junction between two worlds, two groups—the Kerenskyites and the Bolsheviks. The "Square" was reserved for the immense battle scene: the assault on the Winter Palace by the people and the insurgent troops who entered through Red Army Arch. .. . The intended scale of the performance ruled out any scenes dealing with individual characters. The entire action was condensed into group movements, animated tableaux and dynamic crowd scenes. The masses were treated as masses. The sole exception was the small figure of Kerensky, which served to emphasize his insignificant role in the events as they were unfolded. It was all combined to produce a single great panoramic review, filled with satire, tragic fervor, and historic grandeur. A group of young composers wrote the music. Army instructors taught young girls from theater studios marching and rifle drill in order that they could play the Women's Battalion. Hundreds of morning suits, top hats, Generals' uniforms, and ball gowns were obtained for the actors on the "White" platform. The Red Army was busy setting up field artillery batteries in Workers' Gardens.

The producers, their assistants, and everybody else on the production side worked round the clock, living on kasha, tea, and frozen apples. The searchlights installed on the roofs of the buildings surrounding the square lit up the area of action, and one after another, like the episodes in a film, the scenes began to unfold on the Red and White platforms. From the command tower, signals were issued by telephone, using a numbered code to refer to the various episodes.

Right up to the moment when the troops at the front rebelled and when the masses on the Red platform invaded the White, the action developed just as it might have done in the theater. But the moment when the signal rocket sped up from the Square and exploded in the night sky, the spectators and the participants too witnessed one of the most astonishing sights imaginable, a sight which burst the narrow confines of the traditional stage and rose above those earthbound blanks, boldly mixing recent reality with a vivid, audacious, theatricalized interpretation of that reality on a scale hitherto undreamed of. K. N. Derzhavin, 192517

The cognitive experience of this spectacle affected the masses in two ways simultaneously. On the one hand, this street theater demanded strict discipline, the subordination of all participants to the will of the director. It was no accident that "the military provided not only the original idea and much of the cast for these productions but also the organizational models: actors were divided into platoons whose leaders were rehearsed by directors according to a detailed score or battle plan and deployed by the use of military signals and field telephones."18

On the other hand, although this was acting, not reality, and although the rifles were not loaded, the soldiers and sailors were playing themselves. Drawn from the dramatic studios of the Red Army, they were simultaneously involved in the real battles of the Civil War that were raging in the near vicinity of Petrograd, a city under siege and suffering from shortages of food and material goods. It was all the more remarkable, therefore, that they participated in this mock battle with such gusto. A contemporary commented about the general situation: "The quantitative side is staggering. The future historian will record how, throughout one of the bloodiest and most brutal revolutions, all of Russia was acting."19 And according to the author Viktor Shklovskii, "drama circles are propagating like protozoa . . . all Russia is acting; some kind of elemental process is taking place where the living fabric of life is being transformed into the theatrical. The reenactment of the Revolution in the precise place of the original events brought the past into the present directly. When the audience-as-mass was drawn mimetically into the performance in a lived repetition of the "act" of revolution, the spontaneity of this street euphoria threatened a breakdown of control that understandably made the authorities nervous. This mass theater staged not only the revolution, but the staging of revolution, with all the ambiguous relations to power that such political theater implies. A mass of citizens, by reenacting the revolutionary overthrow that is the legitimating moment of present power, disrupts the sequence of history and exposes the contradictory logic of democratic sovereignty.

Are the masses the source of political sovereignty or its instrument? Does revolutionary sovereignty work in collusion with historicism in relegating the revolution to the "once upon a time" of the past? Is this an attempt to insure that, once the revolutionary event has occurred, it is over in more than a temporal sense? Can revolution have any other time but the present? The Bolshevik response to mass spontaneity was to assert sovereign control. Lunacharskii stated his approval of mass festivals in the tradition of the French Revolution, but he echoed Lenin's concern for limiting the spontaneity of these celebrations. Discipline from the outside was necessary, he wrote, because the mass of the people "lacked its own peculiar instinctive obedience to a higher order and rhythm; it was impossible to expect more from it than joyous clamor and the colorful surging of festively dressed people." He described two means by which this ordering "rhythm" might be achieved, military command and cinema direction. Strikingly, he treated these two as one: "Those art forms that have arisen only recently, for example, the cinema or rhythmics, can be used with very great effect. It is ridiculous to enlarge upon the propaganda and agitational strength of the cinema; it is obvious to anyone. And just think what character our festive occasions will take on when, by means of General Military Instruction, we create rhythmically moving masses embracing thousands and tens of thousands of people—not just a crowd, but a strictly regulated, collective, peaceful army sincerely possessed by one definite idea."

With cinema in mind, the directors of the 1920 street theater version of Storming of the Winter Palace treated the palace as a "gigantic actor," producing ingeniously from its architectural form the rhythmic effect of montage. The idea was to present the palace as a kind of "architectural protagonist," and to stage its drama in a rhythmic way, as if it were the "gigantic actor" in a cinema production. Page 146

The scenes as sequential "shots" in the palace window frames: "Each one of the fifty windows of the first floor will in turn show a moment of the development of the battle inside. . . . In the form of silhouetted groups, pieces of the immense action will light up and vanish in the darkness."25 If the directors of this mass production adapted cinema techniques to the old form of street theater, the next step was for cinema to replace the form of street theater itself. The revolution-as-spectacle was superseded by the virtual reality of the revolution filmed. Sergei Eisenstein was the great director of the crowd and the great controller of its rhythms through montage, showing "the mass" as the heroic protagonist of historical events. <>< SOOO MOMS

It has been argued that "the mass" as a coherent visual phenomenon can only inhabit the simulated, indefinite space of the cinema screen.26 Cinema creates an imagined space where a mass body exists that can exist nowhere else. "No reality could stand the intensity of the mass shown in cinema," writes the Russian philosopher Valerii Podoroga.27 He describes Eisenstein's film images of the crowd of people as a composite form, a "protoplasmic being in the process of becoming," a "flow of violence" that fills the screen, with close-ups of faces overwhelmed by shock, extending the human countenance to the "limit of its expressivity."28 Even more than the civil war newsreels of 19181921, Eisenstein's feature filmsStrike (1924), Potemkin (1926), October (1927)gave an experience of the mass that became the reference point for future meaning. At a time when Western directors were filming the crowd as a negative image,29 Eisenstein glorified the mass as an organic force. In 1927 Walter Benjamin (to whom Podoroga is indebted) described Eisenstein's cinema mass as "architectonic" in character: "No other medium could transmit this turbulent collective."30 When later Soviet generations "remembered" the October Revolution, it was Eisenstein's images they had in mind.31 The particular characteristics of the screen as a cognitive organ enabled audiences to see the materiality not only of this new collective protagonist, but also of other ideal entities: the unity of the revolutionary people, the idea of international solidarity, the idea of the Soviet Union itself. Indeed, it is doubtful whether the Soviet experience would have been possible without cinema, and Lenin turned out to be more right than he could have anticipated when he called cinema, of all the arts, "for us" the most important.32 Soviet collective identity, like the revolutionary mass, was a phenomenon that needed the cinema world to be perceived. Vertov's A Sixth of the World (1926), which synthesized old newsreels and new material, was commissioned by Gorstog (the Government Trade Agency) for international < previous page page 147 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%FE%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_147.html [21.01.2009 0:33:43] page_148 < previous page page _148 next page > Page 148 circulation,33 but its impact was______ The Soviet Union as simulacrum! But it was not alone. Precisely in the same period, the United States, laden with new immigrants, was promoting a melting-pot ideology that relied on the silent cinema as it could rely on no other cultural institution. Churches, theaters, schools, holiday rituals, political organizations all embodied specific linguistic and ethnic traditions that worked against this goal. In contrast, Hollywood movies that screened out the past became a cultural force for mass assimilation. In John Ford's film The Iron Horse (1925) the building of the transcontinental railroad symbolized national unity among the Polish, Chinese, and Italian workers who "can put aside labor conflict for the great opportunities of industrial America."34 Not only cinema but mass culture generally had a positive meaning in both the United States and the Soviet Union that it lacked in the ethnically constructed imaginaries of Western European nations, where "masses," a visual phenomenon, and "culture," a literary one, tended to be viewed as antithetical extremes. For the USSR, it was being part of the same historical struggle that created the unity of the masses. For the United States, it was being part of the same territorial space. But for both, with increasing technical realism, the cinematic prosthesis shaped political identifications.

Hollywood created a new mass figure, the individualized composite of the "star." It can be argued that, like Eisenstein's protoplasmic mass, this new being could only exist in the super-space of the cinema screen. The star, quintessentially female, was a sublime and simulated corporeality. Close-ups of parts of her body—mouth, eyes, legs, heaving breast—filled the screen in monstrous proportions. She was an awesome aesthetic spectacle, like a huge church icon, surrounded by the symbolic clutter of the objects of conspicuous consumption.35 The Hollywood star, with a new, non-ethnic name, with rhinoplastic surgery on the nose and orthodontic surgery on the teeth, fulfilled her mass function by obliterating the idiosyncratic irregularities of the natural body. The star was a product for mass consumption, whose multiplying image guaranteed the infinite reproduction of the same. The deeper the camera penetrated, the more it gave back a universal visage, whose features (like those of Eisenstein's crowd) became surface, ornamental lines and contours on the screen. Of course, a true star had to have a particular, identifiable "look." But this was the opposite of the accidental luminescent quality of the natural face. It was a standardized image, a cliché that, like an advertising logo, was instantly identifiable. This mark of "presence" did not refer to the individual, actual person. Rather, the star's body was itself a sign, and its meaning was erotic sexuality.

If the Soviet screen provided a prosthetic experience of collective power, the Hollywood screen provided a prosthetic experience of collective desire. < previous page page_148 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_148.html [21.01.2009 0:33:44] page_149 < previous page page_149 next page > Page 149 In Hollywood movies, class movement meant social mobility, the revolution was sexual, the decisive events were marriage and divorce. But the star was as much an indigenous inhabitant of the cinema screen as the revolutionary mass. Both, as simulacric corporealities, were given as an object of cognition only on the surface of the screen, reflecting back to the viewing audience a perception of the mass-as-image which it internalized. The crowd in a movie theater not only experienced the masses; it had a mass experience. The movie audience, more than an assembly of individual viewers, was one viewer, infinitely reproduced. The potential power of this mass viewer was enormous, but so was the potential for its manipulation. With cinema as with other media, the means of social control was not organizational but mimetic. In the Soviet Union and in the United States, a certain doubling of the image world occurred as social life rematerialized cinema's virtual forms. Phenomena that at first existed only as images (on the cinema screen, in advertisements, in propaganda posters) began to impinge on reality, a development with important political consequences.

It is enlightening to compare the construction of Hollywood, "Home of the Stars," with the construction of the super-projects of socialism in the time of Stalin. In both cases there was an attempt to create a material environment whose larger-than-life proportions would allow the new super-bodies to move in and take up residence. Hollywood's movie stars and Eisenstein's movie masses begin to leave traces in reality, as signs that these phantasmagoric forms in fact exist: the stars leave their handprints on Hollywood's sidewalk cement; the revolutionary mass haunts the expansive boulevards of Soviet cities.

The individual can feel lost in these heroic stage sets. Their larger-than-life proportions make actually lived reality appear impoverished in comparison. The Soviet citizen, like the Western man in the crowd, is exposed to a specifically modern anxiety of the meaninglessness of the individual that leads to enthusiastic endorsing of this process of doubling. If the collective imaginaries of both capitalism and socialism are virtual worlds, making them real becomes the social project. But the fact that this project is the doubling of a dream image lends to its material construction a phantasmagoric quality.

Movie stars had Hollywood homes, but Mr. and Mrs. America too were promised a dream house which, despite its mass production, was studded with superficial luxuries and signs of distinction meant to confer specialness onto its fungible inhabitants. Under Stalin the fantasy of the mass body influenced social projects to the point that enormity of size became the overarching criterion of construction, whether of a factory or a collective farm, a university or a subway system, a hydroelectric project or a canal system. This awesome hugeness was reincorporated within the sublime body of the leader, the gigantically proportioned image of Stalin himself.

4.2 Aesthetics of the Surface

In articles written in 1925-1926, Malevich criticized Russian filmmakers for giving way on the revolutionary artistic goal of leaving representation behind. "Images triumph on the screen," he wrote scoffingly of what he saw as the tendency even among avant-garde directors of treating camera stills as oil paintings, pictures of something.37 The film surface, he argued, should itself be the content of cinema. His foray into filmmaking with Hans Richter in 1927 put this theory into practice.38 Black forms moved on a white background, suggesting nothing so much as the movie version of his own suprematist paintings.

In 1929, when Malevich had already made his surprising return to representational painting, Dziga Vertov produced Man with a Movie Camera, a tour-de-force of cinematic technique. Man with a Movie Camera celebrated the productive process of filmmaking as a form of epistemological experimentation, in ways that still have power to challenge cognitive conventions in our time. The film demonstrates the full range of technical possibilities of the camera, which itself plays the leading role, allowing the audience to learn about moviemaking from the position of expertise of the cameraman.

In contrast, Malevich's interest in an abstract aesthetics of the surface connects him, surely against his intent, to a very different tradition of films and photographs that treat the mass as geometric pattern of the surface. Although there was little left to accident in the shooting of Eisenstein movies, the amorphous flows of his silent-film cinema-masses gave the impression of spontaneity even when they were carefully rehearsed. But in the 1930s, when sound films

The Tiller Girls' legs corresponded to the workers' hands in the Taylorist production process. The mass ornament was politically promiscuous, having no particular party allegiance. In 1933, the right-wing German author Ernst Jünger wrote the introduction to a book of photographs in which the patterns of city streets and tractor-plowed furrows form a surface ornament of abstract orderliness that is the hallmark of instrumental technology. That same year, Busby Berkeley's musical number "Remember My Forgotten Man," choreographed for the Hollywood film The Gold Diggers of 1933, used a similarly abstract aesthetics, composed this time of the human body, to lend visual support to a real political event. It was the "Bonus March" of 1932, when a mass of unemployed veterans came to Washington and squatted in a tent village in order to protest against the federal government's inactivity in addressing the hardships for the working class caused by economic depression.40 In 1936 Leni Riefenstahl captured, in her visually powerful pseudo-documentary Triumph of the Will, the aesthetics of the surface of Hitler's mass rally of German fascists in Nuremberg, staged by the Führer as a media event. But this year also saw the release of Grigorii Aleksandrov's The Circus, the enormously popular Soviet musical that used a mass-ornamental musical number at the climax of the story of an American circus performer, Marion Dixon, who, persecuted in her own country because she has an interracial child, runs away to join the Russian circus.41 Here, among the multiethnic audience, she finds acceptance for the baby and herself. It is clear that Aleksandrov, like most Soviet film directors in the 1930s, had Busby Berkeley in mind for this work. And yet the tableau vivant of the mass as ornament had a specifically Bolshevik precursor as well. It had been scripted into the earliest spectacle celebrations of the October Revolution.

Pro-Berkeley commentators have struggled valiantly to separate the mass ornaments composed by this master craftsman of Hollywood musicals from all the rest. Whereas totalitarian variants celebrated the mass as such, Berkeley's musical numbers are said to rescue the individual, who is submerged within the crowd only to appear again.42 Perhaps more significant in determining the political effect is the fact (it connects him with Vertov) that Berkeley's camera provides a systematic interruption of the dance portrayed. Through the montage of paradoxical points of view and image proportions, as well as the timing of shots, the filmic rhythm supports a counterdance to < previous page page_154 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_154.html [21.01.2009 0:33:50] page_155 page_155 Page 155 4.21 "Remember My Forgotten Man," choreography by Busby Berkeley, from Gold Diggers of 1933 (USA, 1933). , i F ; ‘ 4 ; i i 2 oa in , Gita Fi | | j ¥ ‘J ted, J teen ee TE A ke wt a file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%FE%EB%20%EF%F3%E1 %E. ..

Catastrophe/026202464______ The latter makes us aware of the process by which the illusions of the former are produced, hence undercutting its phantasmagoric effects. The fact that one can also discover this use of the camera in Aleksandrov's Circus is not the point, which is rather that any attempt to make clear distinctions between Soviet, fascist, and Hollywood cinema must close its eyes to the fact, as important as any other at the time, that the "culture" of cinema had a life of its own regardless of political regimes. <> <>< <9 SO OOO MOO OSD Cinema was born mute. Its first language was gestural. The propagation of silent film relied on mimetic appropriations, and these occurred remarkably easily across national boundaries. People who made movies shared a passion. People who watched movies shared an experience, including directors who learned internationally from each other, producing what Miriam Hansen has called the first "global vernacular" of modern experience.43 The world of cinema was a real space as well as a virtual one. Films < previous page page_156 next page > file:///E|/-=Y%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_156.html [21.01.2009 0:33:52] page_157 < previous page page_157 next page > Page 157 could be shipped abroad, they could be stopped at borders, but their gestural language defied the barrier of spoken words. American films began to dominate Russian screen even before the Revolution, a trend that continued throughout the period of NEP. The Soviet film pioneer Lev Kuleshov admitted to being infected with "Americanitis," and he was not alone.44 Hansen describes the increasing "American accent" in Soviet film work generally in the 1920s: faster cutting rate, closer framing, breakdown of diegetic space: "Hyperbolically speaking, one might say that Russian cinema became Soviet cinema by going through a process of Americanization."45 "Americanitis" among filmmakers was not limited to technique. Under the influence of Hollywood, Soviet films veered away from "art" as the model and, like their capitalist counterparts, strove to become popular. Iakov Protazanov returned from years of emigration in the West to produce Aleksei Tolstoi's Aelita (1924), a science fiction fantasy that combined Western cinematic sensibilities with suprematist costume designs. It tells the story of a Soviet space expedition that incites a revolution against tyrants on Mars and returns to earth via a splashdown in Lake Michigan, complete with a love interest between the Martian princess (Aelita) and a Soviet engineer (who may have been dreaming the fantasy all along).46 In the 1920s, the Soviet actress Nina Lee received Soviet acclaim as "the Russian Mary Pickford." Pickford herself visited enthusiastic fans in Moscow in 1926, providing the occasion for the filming of a Soviet domestic production, The Kiss of Mary Pickford.47 She came with Douglas Fairbanks, already famous in the Soviet Union for adventure movies like Son of Zorro (1925) and The Thief of Baghdad (1924). The latter film filled Moscow's largest (1,000-seat) theater for months, and was ranked in a 1928 survey of Soviet audiences as fifth among their ten all-time favorites.48 Up until the First Five Year Plan, foreign films accounted yearly for well over half of total box office grosses in the Soviet Union.49 It was the Soviet film industry's conscious and successful policy to reverse the logic of import substitution: rather than protecting domestic production from foreign competition, the Soviets sought to raise the quality of imported films to the level of their own.

Both Hollywood and Soviet cinema in the 1930s were mass entertainment. Politically, both affirmed official culture and denied certain bleak realities of social development. But when one considers the athletic builds of the female mass ornaments in Circus (1936), or compares its star Liubov Orlova to her Hollywood counterparts, for example Mae West in Belle of the Nineties (1935), it is clear that the erotics of attraction were differently produced.65 There is nothing seductively languid in the Russian star's representation, which is more about theatricality than sexuality. Orlova's vital energy is productive rather than consuming, suggesting a very different economy of desire. The American public was as hero-needy as the Soviet public in the 1930s, but whereas the personal feats of Soviet heroes—the aviator-explorers who were "Stalin's falcons," for example—were officially sponsored and performed for the glory of the collective, those structuring the imagination of U.S. cinema were more about individual successes, an ethos Page 161:



S. mass culture were lonersthe aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh, the movie character Supermanfigures whose individualized power benefited society from outside of the conforming mass, although they were no more capable of challenging the social order than their Soviet counterparts.66 Images circulate within a specific context. They are "framed," first by the photographic or cinematic medium itself, and then by the socio-historical context in which they are shown.67 The former is fixed; the latter constantly changes. Both are necessarily implicated in the truth of the image, not just (and not primarily) as it existed in the past, but also as it survives in the present. The image is thus subject to a third frame, the narrative structure that connects the past to the present. Typically, the parameters of this structure are policed by the academic disciplines of the humanities, the narrative genres of which cordon off specialized areas of the past (social history, art history, history of technology, etc.) in ways that produce blindness as to their connections with each other. It is this third frame, institutionalized in the universities, that so often obscures the present political significance of the cultural inheritance. Because framing counts, we need to know that photographs of machine parts by Rodchenko, familiar in our time from gallery shows where they hang like so many abstract designs, were originally published in workers' newspapers where they pictured the site of the readers' daily labor. We need to juxtapose Eisenstein's eroticized, utopian celebration of machine cultivation and peasant collectivization in the cinema classic Old and New (1929) with the world into which it was released, when the brutal process of dekulakization was beginning in earnest.68 And we need to ask what was behind Margaret Bourke-White's caption for the photograph in her book Eyes on Russia (1931) that reads: "An American Disc-Harrow."69 What is a U.S.-made tractor doing as the center of attention in this photojournalist's documentation of the second largest state farm in the Soviet Union?

A Cosmopolitan Project next page > Page 164 At the start of the First Five Year Plan, Soviet engineers came to visit Albert Kahn Co., Inc., of Detroit, the famous industrial architects who had built Henry Ford's River Rouge plant as well as factories for General Motors, Packard, Oldsmobile, Chrysler, and De Soto. It was in 1928... [that] the most extraordinary commission ever given an architect came in the door unannounced. In that year a group of engineers from the U.S.S.R. came to the Kahn office with an order for a $40,000,000 tractor plant [at Chelyabinsk], and an outline of a program for an additional two billion dollars' worth of buildings. About a dozen of these factories were done in Detroit; the rest were handled in a special office with 1,500 draftsmen in Moscow.71 According to Anthony Sutton, the Cold War historian who documented this case, "The ‘outline of a program' presented to the Kahn organization in 1928 was nothing < previous page page _ 164 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_164.html [21.01.2009 0:34:01] page_165 < previous page page _ 165 next page > Page 165 less than the First and Second Five-Year Plans of 'socialist construction'."73 A factory to produce Fordson tractors was prefabricated in Detroit by the Albert Kahn Company and shipped to Stalingrad in 1929, where it was assembled under the direction of American engineers.74 A contract "under which the Kahn Company became consulting architects to the Soviet Union" was signed in early 1930.75 "The Kahn group undertook design, architectural, and engineering work for all heavy and light industrial units projected by Gosplan. Kahn's chief engineer in the U.S.S.R., Scrymgoeur, was chairman of the Vesenkha building committee."76 Scrymgoeur wrote: The Albert Kahn unit was engaged to control, teach and design all light and heavy industry. .. . By the end of the second year we controlled in Moscow, and from Moscow branches in Leningrad, Kharkov, Kiev, Dniepropetrovsk, Odessa, Sverdlovsk and Novo-Sibirsk 3,000 designers and completed the design of buildings costing (these are Soviet figures) 417 million rubles.77 The Soviets seem to have taken advantage of competitive bidding, however, and the Albert K______ The agreement, signed on May 31, 1929, was for Ford to furnish technical assistance (until 1938) for the plant, which was to be completed by 1933 and would produce the Model A (called by the Soviets Gaz-A), the Ford light truck (Gaz-AA), and the heavy truck (AMO-3). Soviet engineers were to be provided facilities at the River Rouge factory for the study of Ford production methods.

In the economically depressed years of the early 1930s, USS. firms and personnel were grateful for the Soviet business. "Ford was happy to sell $30 million worth of parts and throw in invaluable technical assistance for nothing. Technical assistance in production of axles, tires, bearings, and other items required payment, but the marginal cost to American companies was slight, the Soviets reaped a gigantic harvest of technological knowhow for almost no outlay."

The Austin Company of Cleveland designed not only the plant at Nizhni Novgorod but the "Worker's City" that surrounded it, complete with community housing, nursery, public bath, Palace of Culture, and crematorium. In mid-1929, the A. J. Brandt Company of Detroit undertook an extensive two-year reorganization and expansion of Amo [the automobile plant in Moscow]. The production equipment was entirely American and German. In late 1929, Amtorg [the Soviet trade organization in New York] placed an order on behalf of Amo with the Toledo Machine and Tool Company for $600,000 of cold-stamping presses. In 1932, an order was placed with Greenless Company of Rockford, Illinois for multi-cylinder lathes. In 1936, a second technical-assistance agreement was concluded for Amo with the Budd Manufacturing Company of Philadelphia and the Hamilton Foundry and Machine Company of Ohio to produce 210,000 chassis and bodies per year for a new ZIS-model automobile.

The technology transfer included trained personnel high up in the Soviet economic administration: "Soyuzstroi [the All-Union Construction Trust] had responsibility for about one-quarter of new construction [in the Soviet Union] until 1933 when it was broken into smaller units attached to individual combinats. The Director of Soyuzstroi was Sergei Nemets, formerly an engineer with the Philadelphia construction company of Stone and Webster, Inc. The Chief Engineer of Soyuzstroi was Zara Witkin, whose early projects included the Hollywood Bowl and several large Los Angeles hotels." Even the Soviet "Dream City" of Magnitogorsk was built according to design specifications created in the United States and supervised by a team of American engineers. In March 1930, Arthur McKee and Co. of Cleveland won the foreign bid to turn the building site at Magnitogorsk, an iron lode in the middle of an empty steppe in southern Russia, into the largest mining-energy-chemical-metallurgical complex in the world. It was to be modeled after the U.S. Steel Company's plant in Gary, Indiana, an integrated design that provided a linear flow from raw materials to finished products. McKee undertook to design the entire steel plant, including all auxiliary shops and the iron-ore mine ... [and to be] responsible for directing work on the site until the factory and mine were put into operation, for consulting on equipment orders, for building an electric power station and a dam, and for training Soviet engineers both at the site and in the United States. The Soviet government agreed to pay McKee 2.5 million gold rubles.

The fact that the United States had no diplomatic relations with the USSR was an obstacle to doing business. Germany, which had recognized the Soviet Union and established trade relations with the Rapallo Treaty in 1922, continued to provide serious competition until Hitler came to power in 1933—not coincidentally the year that the United States finally granted recognition to the Soviet regime.

Although design and layout during this period [1929-1932] was American, probably one-half of the equipment installed was German. Of this, a large amount was manufactured in Germany to American design on Soviet account. In quantity, American-built equipment was probably second and British third. ... Cement mills were largely from one firm in Denmark, ball bearings from one firm in Italy and another in Sweden, small ships from Italy, and aluminum technology from a French company.

Sutton concludes that "for the period from 1930 to 1945" Soviet technology was Western technology "converted to the metric system." The fact that Stalin's First and Second Five Year Plans amounted to the largest technological transfer in Western capitalist history was not something that either side advertised, nor did they care to remember this collaboration during the Cold War years. Although part of the public record, it remained an embarrassment for both the United States and the Soviet Union as superpower enemies. And there is more to the story.

Payment for the technology transfer demanded hard currency. Soviet grain exports fell precipitously during the early 1930s, due to the intense famines caused by forced collectivization. The Soviet government found an alternative commodity in the European oil paintings and "household goods" of the aristocracy that had been confiscated after the October Revolution. In 1928 the Soviet government embarked on a major effort to sell Russian art abroad in order to gain hard currency to pay for the imports of the First Five Year Plan. The story of this extravagant international exchange was not documented until 1980. In the words of its historian, Robert Williams, "American buyers have been as reluctant to discuss their purchases as the Soviet government has been to discuss (or even admit) their sales." Yet the Soviet decision was clearly made at the top: "Tractors were needed more than Titianes, Fords more than Fabergés." Millions of dollars' worth of masterpieces of art and thousands of tons of antiques—jewelry, icons, porcelain, rare book manuscripts, Easter eggs, silver, brocades—were sold abroad, and the largest buyers were U.S. citizens. In the twelve months between April 1930 and April 1931 alone, Andrew W. 

Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, bought close to seven million dollars' worth of Hermitage paintings from the Soviet government, a figure that equals half of what the Soviet Union paid in hard currency for imports during that year and "roughly one third of the official total of Soviet exports to the United States in 1930."94 < previous page page_168 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_168.html [21.01.2009 0:34:05] page_169 < previous page page_169 next page > Page 169 Included were two Renaissance masterpieces of Jan van Eyck, five Rembrandts, four Van Dycks, two Halses, as well as paintings by Botticelli, Chardin, Perugino, Poussin, Rubens, Titian, Velasquez, and, the most expensive purchase, Raphael's Alba Madonna, for which Mellon paid almost 1.7 million dollars, at the time the highest price ever paid for a single painting.95 These purchases were kept secret, laundered through a complex web of American entrepreneurs and Soviet officials, at the heart of which were M. Knoedler & Company (art gallery and dealer) and Amtorg (the Soviet trade representative), both based in New York City.96 Knoedler was owned by the entrepreneur Armand Hammer, whose pencil and asbestos factories in the Soviet Union were nationalized in 1930 but who, with his special Soviet connections, turned to selling Russian art objects through department stores in the United States, including, in January 1933, Lord and Taylor.97 Because the Soviet Union lacked diplomatic recognition in the United States, Amtorg, the delegation for the Commissariat of Foreign Trade, had to maintain the legal fiction of being a private corporation of the state of New York, where it was based.98 As for the Secretary of the Treasury's part in the major deal, "for five long years there were only rumors of such a purchase and denials by Mellon."99 According to his lawyer, "Mr. Mellon wanted to keep the thing a surprise until the right moment. It probably would not have been good politics for the Secretary of the Treasury to spend millions for rare paintings at a time when the government was swamped with unemployment, bank failures, and general distress."100 The "right moment" was forced upon Mellon in 1935 when, for years suspected of a conflict of interest, he was charged by the Internal Revenue Service for failing to pay over three million dollars in taxes in 1931.101 "At issue was the taxable status of Andrew Mellon's paintings [donated to his own charitable trust] which he claimed as a deduction on his 1931 income tax return." 102 Only after Mellon had written to President Roosevelt that he planned to bequeath his paintings to the government and offered to build a museum for them did the Board of Tax Appeals dismiss charges of tax fraud.103 "In March 1937, five months before Andrew Mellon's death, President Roosevelt accepted his donation of this entire art collection and a National Gallery of Art in which to house it in the name of the American people."104 With the opening of the National Gallery in Washington, the Hermitage paintings were once again on public display as "nationalized" property—this time on the other side, and in the capitalist manner. The British art dealer Joseph Duveen, testifying at Mellon's trial, criticized the Soviet government for its policy, as a result of which "the Hermitage is no more the greatest collection in the world, it has gone to pieces______

A Soviet museum curator was quoted as saying that such sales were a perfectly acceptable socialist method to "turn diamonds into tractors."107 There was a strange poetic justice in this economic circuit. Mellon, who made an early fortune from steel mills in Pittsburgh, spent it on oil paintings the sale of which enabled construction of the steel mills at Magnitogorsk.108 Thus the profits of capitalism (surplus value withheld from the wages of American workers) moved (via the Mellon family fortune) to finance (via the capitalist firm of McKee Construction Company) the building of technologically advanced socialist factories, an increase in what Marx called "constant capital" that in turn increased the value of Soviet labor. Meanwhile, in the counterdirection, cultural "treasures" that had been owned by the Russian aristocracy and nationalized by the Bolsheviks became (via Mellon's "philanthropic" cover-up of tax evasion) the property of the United States government, and the American public received socialized culture in the form of a national museum. How should this strange merging of supposedly antithetical systems be reckoned? What is the proper accounting, when the sale of one Raphael (at 1.7 million gold dollars)109 buys more than half of the design of one Magnitogorsk (at 2.5 million gold rubles),110 which translates into jobs for tens of thousands of Soviet workers, and the production (by 1938) of millions of tons of finished metal? 111 How does one make political sense out of an economic exchange whereby the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury uses his private millions to "build socialism" in Stalin's Russia at the same time as the output of steel mills in the United States is falling precipitously due to a Great Depression that, to Stalin's delight, affects capitalism alone?112 How does one square with ideological rhetoric the irony of the fact that pre-1929 production levels in the United States were not recovered until World War II when, to St______ There are faint possibilities of actual connection: the fact that the Palace competition had been going on since 1931 and received continuous publicity outside the Soviet Union; the fact that the Empire State Building, completed in 1931 and quickly a symbol of New York City, was also internationally known; the fact that Stalin previewed many Western films while preventing their circulation in his country and could well have seen King Kong; the fact that one of the (uninvited) entrants to the Palace competition was Hector Hamilton, a New York architect who had visited the Soviet Union as part of a team that, according to a Soviet newspaper report, was building "a radio-city in New York" (where King Kong would have its premier), and saw the preliminary Palace projects, admiring their amazing scale. Page 178

But even if the U.S. filmmakers knew about the Palace competition, the movie predated the announcement of the winner. And if Stalin had seen the movie, he would have had little motivation to place Lenin in the compromising position of the defeated beast King Kong. It is likely that both the Palace designers and the moviemakers were influenced by another source, for which there were several possibilities. The idea of integrating monumental human figures into modern architectural forms was characteristic of several entries to the Palace competition.9 Consider, as well, Malevich's architectons, which were on display in 1932 at the < previous page page_175 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%FB%EB%20%EF%F3%E1 %E. ..

Boris M. Iofan, competition project, winning variant, 1932, selected (in 1933) as basis of the final scheme for the Palace of the Soviets, Moscow. Leningrad exhibition "Artists of the RSFSR During Fifteen Years of Soviet Rule."10 The center model, tallest in size, is topped by a statue presumably of Lenin.11 However obscure the prehistory of these images, their afterhistory has been assured. The Palace of the Soviets has become the quintessential example of Stalinist monumentality, an icon of the architecture of dictatorship, while King Kong is the campy ur-form of a whole genre of science fiction films, from Godzilla to Jurassic Park. Can they, as dream images, be made to speak to each other, circumscribing two complementary economies of desire? Lenin has in common with King Kong the fact that both are symbols of the masses, displayed as spectacles for the masses. Like all dream images their meaning is ambivalent, vacillating between a desire that is expressed and a fear that holds it in check. This is what gives them their power to thrill. It is through seduction that they exert control.

King Kong is a movie about making a movie. A New York director has a map of an uncharted island and wants to sail there to film its mystery, which turns out to be the monster, Kong. He finds a girl, Ann, on the New York streets stealing apples—it is the time of the Great Depression—and promises to make her a star. When the hero, who will later fall in love with Ann, asks: "Why take a girl along?" the director responds: "Because the public, bless 'em, has to have a pretty face to look at . . . and this time I'm going to give 'em what they want." Of course, the public is not alone. The movie opens with an "old Arabic proverb": "And lo, the beast looked upon the face of beauty." It proves his undoing, at least according to the director, who proclaims over Kong's fallen, furry body lying dead at the base of the Empire State Building: "It was beauty that killed the beast." Because Kong, too, falls in love with Ann, he is identified with the public that "loves a pretty face," precisely the mass audiences whom the directors of the film hope to attract. 1. Description of the masses as a giant animal, an instinctual, primitive force, was common at the time.13 An association in the film intensifies when the director and his movie crew reach the mysterious Skull Island. King Kong is held back behind a giant gate from natives who have forgotten the more advanced civilization that built it. The native "primitives" worship Kong, providing for him the obligatory sacrifice of virgin girls. There is much in the movie that is racist. The dark-skinned villagers are as far removed from civilization as Kong himself.14 But the film's depiction of the "barbaric" and "primitive" have an antidemocratic association as well. When the natives, planning to kidnap the blond heroine as a sacrifice for Kong, carry torches through the village and sing primitive chants, the director quips, watching from the ship, "It looks like the night before election."
2. The jungle into which Kong abducts Ann is a surreal space where prehistory, populated by dinosaurs, has all of the dreamlike quality of unconscious forces. We are clearly in the realm of sexual fantasy; the prehistoric beasts are raw, virile power, and Ann's abduction by Kong is a seduction as well.15 Yet the connection between beasts and dangerously powerful masses (the working class during the depression) is sustained in the staging of a boxing match between Kong and a dinosaur that mirrors the cuts and jabs of this quintessentially working-class sport. 16
3. Kong is massive, "as big as a house." When he is brought back captive to "civilized" New York, this colossal, bestial force rebels, tearing apart his chains like some revolutionary proletariat that has just read the Communist Manifesto, and terrifying the well-dressed audience whom he has been placed on the stage to entertain. Loose on New York's streets, Kong destroys an elevated train like a mob on the rampage. ("It's a kind of Gorilla!" someone says. "Gee, ain't we got enough of them in New York?") Enraged at "civilization," Kong has the brute strength to threaten structures of power. But lured by the spectacle of a pretty face, his subjectivity changes from threatening to loving in a prototypical example of the "metamorphosis of consumption."17
4. Diverted by the display of fashionable female beauty, he succumbs, not only to love but to the bourgeois proprietary impulse, the desire for possession. Holding Ann tenderly in his paw like a child's toy, Kong plucks off pieces of her pretty dress like petals. Or he grabs her out of a skyscraper window, as if out of a shop window, and carries her off. The director, making a direct analogy to Kong, observes that even "tough guys," go "soft and sappy" if "beauty gets to" them, suggesting a vitiation of virility connected with consumption and implying a "feminine" side to the masses symbolized by Kong. But it is a dangerous femininity, irrational, primitive, and out of control. King Kong is no Frankenstein produced by the latest in technology but rather an atavistic residue from a past era, a return of the repressed. The audience in the film is terrified by the unleashed monster. The audiences watching the film (we ourselves) feel not only terror but empathy as well. He embodies the force of our own desire to find in a romantic dreamworld solace for the industrial civilization that brutalizes the physical animals all of us remain. King Kong was escapist entertainment for a public in the throes of the Great Depression, channeling antisocial forces into romance and adventure while showing the animal symbol of the crowd as defeated definitively. The circuit of desire, like that of the commodity, is acted out in the space between the cultural object (the film) and collective imagination, a space of leisure cordoned off from the production process. And it is important that, although the audience of King Kong sees the story of the movie's movie in the making, they do not see how the real movie was fabricated. Of course, Kong's prehistoric world was a modern technological accomplishment. But to this day, how some of the film's special effects were achieved remains a mystery. In the movie, the director says to the crowd of well-heeled people who have paid twenty dollars to be entertained by Kong: "Seeing is believing." But what cannot be seen remains misunderstood. The fact that the means of production of a cultural commodity is invisible is the trademark of capitalist spectacles. They are phantasmagorias that seduce the senses, a shadowland of the fulfillment of desire.

One last point, a bizarre detail. The directors of King Kong—the real directors, Cooper and Schoedsack—make a brief appearance within the film. They are the fighter team in one of the U.S. Air Force planes that shoot down Kong. (It is, indeed, not beauty that kills the beast, but the technologically armed power of the state.) Cooper is reported to have had the idea of this cameo appearance: "We should kill the sonofabitch ourselves." He had learned to fly in World War I. After the war he stayed in Europe as a mercenary pilot, hired in 1920 to fight on the side of Poland in the war against the Bolsheviks.

18 DOOODPOOOOOO OD A maquette of what was renamed (after 1936) the Palace of the Supreme Soviet was exhibited at the Paris world's fair in 1937. Although the site had been cleared as early as 1931, the construction of the actual building was continuously postponed.19 The Soviet press in the thirties repeatedly discussed its future grandeur, which was to include "17,500 square meters of oil painting, 12,000 frescoes, 4,000 mosaics, 20,000 bas-reliefs, 12 group sculptures up to 12 meters high, 170 sculptures up to six meters high."20 Size was the most awesome quality of all the elements of the Palace. It was an example of the Soviet sublime, which had a very particular logic. In Kant's classical Western analysis of the sublime, the individual who observes a natural phenomenon of overwhelming magnitude proves the autonomy of the human mind, hence its superiority < previous page page_180 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3I%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_180.html [21.01.2009 0:34:16] page_181 < previous page page_181 next page > Page 181 over nature, by rising above the uncomprehending limits of sensory imagination to understand even the infinite as one of "reason______ The maquette of the Palace of the Supreme Soviet is a fantasy object that must be imagined into existence on a gigantic scale. The idea of the sublime that it suggests is one of overcoming the physical limits of the collective workers who will build it. The latter are required to sacrifice themselves, as sensory beings, in order to build a new world for the proletarian masses. In proportion as their own physical selves are diminished, the collective is enhanced in symbolic form. "There's a labor of lust and it's in our blood." This statement by the poet Osip Mandelshtam captures the essence of Homo sovieticus, or so argued the contemporary critic Mikhail Epstein at the end of the Soviet era.21 Epstein describes the "frenzied erotics" of Soviet labor: "This love is general, public, and belongs to no one, which is why, in the feverish passion of labor, something hopeless and depraved suddenly washes up: you pour your seed together with everyone else's onto the same eggs (‘collective ownership of the means of production’). In this atmosphere, even a truly industrious person feels like a fornicator." This is, says Epstein, a special variant of "aesthetics"—not the "disinterested interest" which Kant described and for which the model of aesthetics is play, but "disinterested labor," gigantic quantities of which are expended for its own sake, indifferent to the results: "All that matters is the bitter satisfaction and oblivion that labor itself provides."22

The perverse ecstasy of labor is captured in the novel of 1930 that remained unpublished in the Soviet Union until 1987, Andrei Platonov's The Foundation Pit (Kotlovan). In it, workers are heroically digging the foundation for an enormous building to provide housing for the proletariat of the world—it might as well be the foundation for the Palace of the Soviets. The workers’ zeal is invincible, they have to be made to stop digging. "What do you mean stop work?" asked Chiklin. "We can still get out a cubic meter or a cubic meter and a half more and there's no point in stopping work earlier." "But you must stop work," the superintendent objected. "You have already been working more than six hours [on a Saturday] and the law is the law." "That law is only for tired elements," interjected Chiklin, "and I have a bit of strength left before sleep. Who agrees with me?" he asked all of them. "It's a long time till night," Safronov reported. "Why should we waste our lives. We would do better to do a job. After all we are not animals, we can live for the sake of enthusiasm."23

The Russian philosopher Valerii Podoroga, observing that Soviet Man "lacked several important details," notes: "The head was missing."24 The problem with Voshchev, the hero of Platonov's Foundation Pit, is that he has one: "Do not people lose in their feeling for their own life when construction projects gain?" Voshchev hesitated to believe. "A human being puts together a building—and comes apart himself. And who is going to exist?"25 Voshchev is a Soviet antihero, dismissed from his job due to "a growth in the strength of his weakness," which is to think "about the plan of life as a whole," causing too much "pensiveness in the midst of the general tempo of labor."27 The potency of the masses channeled into the cosmocratic body creates an endless productivity of more and larger. There is no limit to this escalation. It is the logic of Stakhanovism, which replaced Taylorism as the model of Soviet labor in the 1930s.28 The Stakhanovite body is not a machine; it feels pain. The physical suffering that hollows out the individual for the sake of the collective is the ecstasy of the Soviet sublime. The triumph of the body is its destruction as well.

Aleksei Stakhanov was a Donbass coal miner who in 1934 overshot the scientifically established work pace by hewing 102 tons in a single shift—fourteen times the quota—breaking all established records and Taylorist norms and becoming the symbol of the shock brigades of Stalin's Five Year Plans.29 Eventually, half the workforce became "Stakhanovites," women as well as men.30 While practical benefits for these heroes of labor included access to an apartment, consumer goods, and tickets to the Bolshoi, the highest honor was to meet Stalin in person, and conferences were held periodically for this purpose. An exchange of joyous smiles and a handshake with Stalin expanded the size of the labor hero, until his own image mirrored the monumentality of the great leader himself.

Sergei Eisenstein in Mexico, 1931. Sergei Eisenstein sent a snapshot of himself straddling a cactus in Mexico to his friend Ivor Montagu in the early thirties. He inscribed it: "Speaks for itself and makes people jealous!"31 When work drains a human being of potency and bestows it on collective forms, their colossal size, overwhelming actual humans, engenders a sexual economy of sadomasochism. Of course there is humor in Eisenstein's image. The film director was remarkably capable of sublimating desire into artistic creativity. But his own homoeroticism, for which Soviet society had no place, took the form of sadomasochism, thus paralleling the erotics of domination and submission generated by the power of Stalin's regime. The underside of the monumentality of Stalinist style was the bodily punishment of individual workers, their ecstatic smiles expressing pleasure at physical pain.

Boris Kustodiev, The Bolshevik, 1920. From the earliest years of the Bolshevik regime, the power of the revolutionary masses was represented by gigantic human proportions. Aleksei Gastev, who became director of the Central Institute of Labor, expressed this sensibility in a 1918 poem, "Mbi rastyom iz zheleza" (We Grow Out of Iron), from the cycle "Poetry of the Factory Floor." It describes a worker—symbolizing all workers—who absorbs strength from the metal of the industrial machines that surround him until he grows as tall as a giant: "My shoulders are forcing the rafters, the upper beams, the roof," and shouts from the sky: "Victory shall be ours!"3______ Its ritual expression was the organized demonstration in Red Square, the mass parade of people and weapons filing past Stalin and the high party officials as they used Lenin's mausoleum as a viewing platform. In 1938, on the anniversary of the October Revolution, 360 fighters and bombers flew overhead, forming the giant letters "LENIN" in the sky. Workers bore portraits of Lenin and Stalin and cheered: "Hurrah for our Stalin who has given us a happy life." One and a half million people marched by Stalin, a gigantic receiving line, reflecting the colossal proportions of party power.33

5.10 Still from King Kong (USA, 1933). Special effects in the jungle, as the hero rescues Ann. With critical humor, a 1981 painting by Komar and Melamid brings us round full circle to the monster world of King Kong. Whereas Kong had a boxing match with a dinosaur, here the massive beast is merely an object of certain interest, and, compared in scale to the superhuman figures who behold it, a proportionately small one at that. The painting is entitled Bolsheviks Returning Home after a Demonstration. This image can be read as a rebus of the relationship between the individual and mass society, one that mirrored the U.S. experience in an inverted form. Not the power of pleasure, but the pleasure of power provides the key. If one can speak of a repressed "collective unconscious" in both cases, social authority shaped its contents paradoxically by allowing its expression, providing for it an aesthesiological field of play.

DODO OIOHOOOOO Carnival festivals in Moscow's Gorky Park of Culture and Leisure were a frequent summertime event in the era of high Stalinism. (One of the attractions in this "strange and Disneylandish" park was a parachute tower reminiscent in style of Tatlin's Monument to the Third International.)34 Here is a description from 1937: In the night of the Sth to the 6th of August, a hundred thousand participants in costumes and masks were dancing waltz and tango, slow and fast fox-trot, they were ench______ In the ensuing months, between 15,000 and 30,000 of the 75,000 Red Army officers were fatalities of the purge, and at least one fourth of the engineers of the aircraft industry lost their jobs. It is this double-edged imaginary of Stalinist culture, the dreamworld of happiness promised to the masses and the nightmare awaiting those who were banished from it, that became the effective instrument of mass control. And it is here that Western capitalism and Soviet socialism need to be thought together as systems of power. Capitalism harms human beings through neglect rather than through terror. Compared to the personal will of a dictator, the structural violence of market "forces" appear benign. Those individuals (or groups) excluded from capitalism's dreamworlds appear themselves to be to blame. The fate of the poor is social ostracism. Their gulag is the ghetto.

In the following pages, the author discusses the concept of domestic space and the differences between the "window-on-the-future" tableau in U.S. advertising and its socialist translation in a Magnitogorsk workers' newspaper. The author describes the differences in the depiction of masculine fantasy and the subtle differences in the environments, such as the presence of flowers and lace curtains in the Soviet illustration. The author also mentions the unexpected presence of a rubber plant, which, according to Svetlana Boym, is a symbol of petit-bourgeois degeneracy. The unacceptability of this tropical house plant was hardly due to the imperialist connections. Rather, it "Was regarded as the last sickly survivor of the imagined bourgeois greenhouses, or a poor relative of the ubiquitous geranium in the windowboxes of middle-class residences; geraniums were purged and physically eradicated in Stalin's time."41 We do not know if the illustrator, too, was purged for the domestic bad taste of this image.42 But its open window leads us into the domestic space where people actually experienced the differences between socialism and capitalism in daily life (byt), both as dream and as reality. Again, the codependency of the two Cold War enemies is striking. "Good" was defined as the other of the other (that is, as what the enemy re-

Jected), entwining them in a dialectical death embrace that ensured neither side would escape the binaries of the discursive frame that contained them both. If the bedrock of capitalism was private property, which in domestic life meant the private home, then socialism would need to be "anti-home." That was indeed the policy of early Bolshevism. Domestic coziness was viewed as an enemy. Maiakovskii wrote poems in outrage against the feminized, petit-bourgeois domestic scene with its private fetish objects, canaries and kittens, prompting the newspaper Komsomolskaia Pravda to launch a campaign, "Down with Domestic Trash" (1928-1929): "Let us stop the production of tasteless bric-a-bracs! With all these dogs, mermaids, little devils and elephants, invisibly approaches meshchanstvo [the petty-bourgeois]. Clean your room! Summon bric-a-brac to a public trial!"43 The war against domesticity was not limited to style. Within a new proletarian culture of cooperation and communal space, "the very word family loses its meaning."44 Day care for children, public canteens and hot meals in the workplace, industrial laundries and ready-made foods were to free women from the "backwardness" of privatized domestic labor. Leisure time, too, would be socialized outside the home in clubs, public baths, cinemas, reading rooms, physical-training halls, and parks and "palaces" of leisure and culture. Sentimental love and domestic bliss, the highest ideals of bourgeois morality, were rejected in favor of a demystified sexuality. If capitalism exploited erotic desire as a means for selling commodities, the radical communist response was to treat desire as a need to be fulfilled as unremarkably, in Aleksandra Kollontai's famous phrase, as thirst is by "drinking a glass of water."45 While there was no room within Soviet socialism for the U.S. dream of the single-family home in the suburbs with its white picket fence (with the correlative nightmare of urban slums for the poor), the universal right of all Soviet citizens to "housing" was championed as fundamental. 46 Women's liberation was defined in terms of liberation from the domestic realm, so that they would be free to enter the realm of productive labor. Patriarchy was attacked in campaigns to eliminate the veil for Muslim women, or to prohibit the practice of polygamy in cultures of the "north people," or to combat the general "absence of culture" (bezkulturnost') in male behaviors of wife-beating, heavy drinking, card playing, and bawdy humor. Abortions were legalized. Divorce was made simple. Virginity was unnecessary. Multiple partners were condoned. These well-intentioned policies foundered on basic misapprehensions (which fifty years later Western feminists in critical dialogue with Marxism would expose). Fundamentally problematic was the fact that the whole notion of "equality" was in no way distinguishable from the bourgeois-liberal model.47 Marriages were still imagined in commercial terms as a "free contract" between a man and woman, obscuring the unfreedom of women within them.48 The 1918 Family Law treated women as equal to men in ways that devalued their differences.49 The presumption was naive that the way to eliminate patriarchy was to eliminate families altogether. Although abortions were legalized, no priority was given in the planned economy for developing the technologies of birth control and programs for their dissemination. Although women worked alongside men in almost all occupations, the men did not reciprocate in tasks of childrearing and domestic chores. While the percentage of women rose to impressive levels in the medical and educational professions, these professions, once "feminized," declined in social prestige and pay as a result. Where patriarchal attitudes remained when patriarchal laws were undermined, women continued to suffer from the former while losing the protections that the latter had provided. It is not surprising that when the Family Law was debated in public forums throughout the Soviet Union prior to its revision in 1926, women expressed great frustration regarding the consequences of the new sexuality.50 It is understandable that a society organized around the central value of production devalued family life and domestic space, the sites of replenishment and repair. Less to be expected is the degree to which the emotional affect associated with the family was capable of being displaced onto the site of production itself. Workers expressed their "love" for "little Magnitogorsk" (Magnitka);51 they developed a "relationship" with their furnace. Page 196

5.18 Children hailing the start of the AMO factory, Moscow, 1931. One's "native" factory (rodnoi, a word normally applied to one's birthplace) was one's social identity.57 There was no private realm: "all was 'public,' and public meant the factory": "Here at Magnitka the whole family takes part and lives the life of our production."58 Again, there was mutuality in this relationship of familial care, as the factory provided the worker with job security. Reversing the relation of the capitalist factory to the worker, the Soviet factory fostered production for employment's sake.59 Social security, not industrial efficiency, was the principle of labor practice, and during the 1930s, when workers throughout the capitalist world were experiencing the most basic employment insecurity, the fact that "job rights were taken seriously" by Soviet socialism "was revolutionary."60

Proud parents find affectionate, heartfelt, encouraging words for each of their sons. Stalin has dubbed his aviators "falcons." He sends his falcons into flight and wherever they wander keeps track of them, and when they return, he presses them close to his loving heart.63 In his parental role, Stalin as father is motherly more than punitive, nurturing rather than disciplinary. The Soviet family drama is pre-Oedipal. It is for not loving the mother/leader that the child is punished, which makes the psychic transition to adulthood impossible. Fantasies of pre-Oedipal childhood omnipotence permeate the images of shock work and norm-breaking. In this narcissistic realm of the imaginary, the withdrawal of maternal love threatens the body directly, ranging from the withholding of nourishment to physical disappearance. The corporeal insecurity of famine and terror is the hidden side of Stalin's parenting. The authenticating gaze of the mother merges with the surveilling gaze of the state.

In the mid-1930s, at the height of Stalinism, pro-natalist policies resurrected the family and glorified maternal power. At the same time, actual mothers lost the gains toward adult autonomy that they had made in the revolution. The revised Family Law of June 1936 made abortions illegal except in life-threatening cases, but in all cases "it was up to the doctors to decide and not the woman."64 The rehabilitation of the family entailed the celebration of fecundity. Earlier iconography of peasant women driving tractors (symbolizing the historical advance of this most "packward" class and sex) was challenged by the return of the traditional image of women as mothers: "The theme of rural abundance demanded that women be reconfigured and enlisted as ideological symbols of kolkhoz fecundity."65 The woman's fecund body was a productive body; that is what tied the new pro-childbearing imagery to the socialist modernizing project. But this affirmation of biological reproduction on the ideological level did not translate into a transformation of domestic space. If virtuous citizens in fact began to be rewarded with private flats, this concession to the lifestyle of capitalism could not be endorsed as official policy.

Communal kitchen with separate burners. Detail from Ilia Kabakov, The Communal Apartment, installation, 1980s. for the avant-garde designs for living spaces conceived in the 1920s, such projects were no longer central to the ideological order.66 In the increasingly crowded metropolises, the domestic reality for millions of citizens was the communal apartment, an idiosyncratic Soviet institution that developed more by default than by design. As a lived-in example of the formula "capitalist in form, socialist in content," it was a microcosm of what was wrong with the Soviet conception. Socialist living was to take place in a differently configured but structurally unchanged bourgeois space. The communal apartment (kommunalka) emerged out of the 1920s as a pragmatic response to housing needs. Whereas all Soviet citizens were to be guaranteed a living space______ The law provided a formal criterion: individuals were to receive a minimum of ten square meters and families a minimum of thirteen. It led to the apportioning of one room or the partitioned section of a room, the "red corner" with its portraits of Stalin and Lenin (where later the television set would be installed), the bathroom (where the intimacy of the body was assigned to common space), and the toilet (where the most basic physical needs had to be collectively negotiated).

Page 200

Well into the twentieth century, indoor plumbing [in the United States] remained a matter of class: the rich had it, the poor did not. By the late 1920s, surveys indicated that indoor plumbing had left the luxury category. Only about 7 percent of the small wage earners studied by the Chicago Department of Public Welfare in 1925 still had to go outside to use the toilet, although many had to leave their apartments to use a shared bathroom. Many of their bathtubs had only a cold-water tap, and frozen pipes rendered all facilities useless for long periods; conditions for these stockyard, railroad, factory and service workers, 44 percent of whom were black and 17 percent Mexican-born, had improved only slightly over those for workers of the previous decades. Urban-rural differences continued to matter. The President's Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership reported that 71 percent of urban families surveyed and 33 percent of rural ones had bathrooms in the late 1920s.

Page 201

Before the Bolshevik Revolution, Russia had imported much of its plumbing from the West, and the Crane Company, already a leader in the field, gave to the Russian language the word kran for faucet.

Page 201

The forced intimacy of the communal apartment was a particular kind of terror, affecting the most banal practices of every day. It kept the body in perpetual public exposure and intervened in the ecological circuit of all the senses. Its ideological justification was the utopian claim that public life was personal fulfillment. If life had indeed become "better, more cheerful," as Stalin claimed in 1935, then there was no need for a retreat into a private domain. In contrast, capitalist industrialization was grounded on a duality of work life and domestic life. No one claimed that industrial labor would bring personal fulfillment. No one denied the humiliation of factory labor, which brutalized the senses and subjected bodily movement to rigid controls. Utopia was imagined, rather, as compensatory. What was robbed from the worker as producer would be returned to the worker as consumer. Domestic space became the site of this rectification. The ideology of the private home came to bear a tremendous burden, that of legitimating the entire system of industrial capitalism, and nowhere more so than in the United States. The specific configuration of this domestic utopia underwent several transformations. In the 1920s, while the Soviets were promoting the application of industrial techniques to domestic tasks in order to eliminate domestic space, in the United States Page 202

The directional tendency was reversed. The home itself was to become industrialized. "Home economics" would make domestic labor scientific. Taylorist techniques would make it efficient. Machines would automate "the business of living" and eliminate the need for a servant class. The consequence of this ideology, which remained an ideal and not a reality for the majority (who had no servants to eliminate in the first place), was to increase the isolation of the nuclear family by making the home even more self-contained, and to intensify the feminization of labor within it.

The ideology of the industrialized home privileged specific commodities: sewing machines, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, electric irons—indeed, electricity itself.79 The fact that each individual household would need to own these commodities increased the potential market. The fact that Fordist labor policies promised to put higher wages in workers’ pockets seemed to ensure the commodity market's continuing growth.

The ideological attempt to identify democratic equality with commodity consumption came up against a basic contradiction, the fact that those who have the most need of commodities have the least money to buy them. Nonetheless, U.S. advertisers attempted to make a virtue out of the structural inequality between classes by developing what has been called the "parable of the Democracy of Goods."80 A 1926 advertisement for Chase and Sanborn Coffee told consumers that although "compared with the riches of the more fortunate, your way of life may seem modest indeed," no "king, prince, statesman, or capitalist" could enjoy a better cup of coffee.81 Similar claims were made for breakfast cereals, toilet seats, soap bars, and even burial vaults.82 When the Great Depression cut deep into consumption levels of most people, the appeal of this message of sharing at least something with the wealthy actually increased. In 1932 the Hoover Company launched a "mansion-and-cottage" campaign to sell vacuum cleaners, covering "the whole ground of feminine longing and feminine envy" by constructing around its product the desire to own at least something that "the richest woman in the world can't outdo her in."83 The full ideological pressure of commodity culture was not felt in the United States until the 1950s, when it took on new meaning in the context of the Cold War.

5.26 Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid, Double Self-Portraits as Young Pioneers, 1985-1986. (color plate 7) Because U.S. production of consumer durables was the only aspect of capitalist industrial culture that had not been copied by the Soviet Union, it became the most powerful marker of difference. The United States government joined the capitalist class in its ideological commitment to the expansion of consumption without limits. Similarities of consumer styles came to be viewed as synonymous with social equality, and not merely as a compensation for its lack. Democracy was freedom of consumer choice. To suggest otherwise was un-American. The family home and the family car were the fundaments of the American dream, and modern kitchens and multiple bathrooms were its crowning glory.

Unlike the arms race and the race to outer space, commodity production was an area in which the Soviet Union was not yet close to catching up.84 In 1959, as an act of detente, the United States and Soviet Union exchanged cultural exhibitions, and it was no accident that the display sent to Moscow included a model of the American family home. Against the backdrop of its fully modern kitchen, Vice President Nixon engaged Premier Khrushchev in a press-covered "kitchen debate" about the relative merits of the two ways of life.85 In the Soviet Union, land of the communal apartment, the propaganda effect of this exhibit would have been stunning.86 Of course, as Khrushchev himself pointed out, the American dream was not its reality. Those who counted as "consumer citizens" excluded the nation's poor. Class and race mattered. But even among those who were enacting the dream, the ideological burden took its toll. Commodities inserted themselves within every human interaction of U.S. domestic life, mediating all human affect—parenting, loving, caring, nurturing, socializing, and family celebrations.

The bearers of this commodity culture, those American housewives who were actually living in the domestic utopia, were far from content. Isolated from adult society, weighted down with household tasks that commodities increased rather than eliminating, infantilized by advertising appeals, and excluded from

In an attempt to free themselves of the "feminine mystique" of domestic life, middle-class U.S. women entered the workforce, but with the result that the two-income family that in the 1970s was an exercise of choice had by the 1990s become for millions a financial necessity. 

Conversely, women who under socialism might have desired the choice of staying at home were forced to return there because of the structural unemployment that followed socialism's demise.88 With the end of the Cold War came the dismantling of the welfare state on both sides, undermining the social support that families had relied upon and transforming it into commodified "services" as a growing sector of the capitalist economy. Industrial modernity in both really existing forms, capitalist and socialist, created a hostile environment for human life, precisely the opposite of the dream of modernity. Within this contradiction, power thrived, inserting itself between the dreamer and the dream’s fulfillment, drawing upon the energy of the former and sustaining itself by the perpetual postponement of the latter. In its construction of desire, industrial modernity offers as a substitute for human fulfillment the illusion of omnipotence. Its form under capitalism is the consumer illusion of instant gratification, while long-term needs go unattended and social security is so precarious that unemployment strikes with the fate of a natural catastrophe.89 Under the Soviet style of socialism, the situation is reversed: the illusion is that the state will provide total security (in return for total dependency), while there is no control over immediate satisfactions. Whether you happen to collide with bread tomorrow is left totally to chance. < previous page page_205 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%FE%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_205.html [21.01.2009 0:34:45] page_206 < previous page page_206 next page > Page 206 5.27 Aleksandr Kosolapov, Symbols of the Century, 1982.

Existing socialism did not give control to actual individuals over the means of production; that belonged instead to the imaginary masses. Existing capitalism still does not provide for the fulfilment of social needs, profiting instead from the instability of individual desire. The Soviet propaganda of production was as divorced from real production as capitalist advertising was (and is) from the use value of the product. Both infantilized a mass public, whose naivete had limits. By the 1980s, no one in the United States really believed the promises of advertising, just as no one in the Soviet Union really believed the promises of socialist propaganda. Both allowed the dreaming masses to express themselves without giving them their due. < previous page page_207 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CDY%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_207.html [21.01.2009 0:34:47] page_208 < previous page page_208 next page > Page 208 5.3 Awakening Walter Benjamin wrote: "Capitalism was a natural phenomenon with which a new dream sleep fell over Europe, and with it a reactiv______ Each station was a total environment, combining architecture, mosaics, and sculpture, thematically designed and aesthetically executed to depict a theme: The Ploshchad Revolutsii (Revolutionary Square), with its sculpted reliefs of revolutionary bravery, the grand Prospekt Mira (Prospect of Peace), with its bas-reliefs of agricultural scenes, the "art deco" Stantsiia Maiakovskaia (Maiakovskii Station), with its ceiling mosaics of sky and clouds, flying machines and flying men, and the sumptuous, tsar-like ornamentation of Stantsiia Komsomolskaia (Komsomol Station), with its mosaics of past national heroes. This was, indeed, interior decoration for the masses. And if in the last years of glasnost', you asked the residents of Moscow about their childhood experiences of this extraordinary metro, they would tell you that it was a magical place, comparable to a Disney theme park, except that it cost only a few kopecks to enter, and that its multiple phantasmagorias intervened habitually into their daily life. Comparable, also, to a cathedral, except that you traversed it in a distracted state, always moving with, through, or against the crowd, on your way to somewhere else.

Critics have written that the wonderful world of the Moscow metro was all illusion, belying the failure of socialism above the ground. They have criticized its artistic style for abdicating the modernist project and returning to a prerevolutionary aesthetics. They have noted that such architectural forms interpellated a mass subject, dismissing the individual as insignificant. No doubt the critics are right. But precisely because these socialist dreamworlds entered into the utopian fantasy of childhood, they acquired a critical power, as memory, in adults. The generation of Gorbachev and glasnost' grew up in Stalin's Russia. Komar and Melamid, enfants terribles of the late-Soviet art world, painted a series of parodic images of Soviet culture sacrilegious in the extreme, but also ambivalent, as is their painting of a red banner with the slogan "Thank you, Comrade Stalin, for our Happy Childhood." There is nostalgia as well as derision in this message, nostalgia for a world that was supposed to be.

The gap between the utopian promise believed in by children and the dystopian actuality that they experience as adults can indeed generate a force for collective awakening. This is the moment of disenchantment—recognizing the dream as dream. But a political awakening demands more. It requires the rescue of the collective desires to which the socialist dream gave expression, before they sink into the unconscious as forgotten. This rescue is the task of the dream's interpretation. During the Cold War, when East and West were in competition for the loyalty of the masses, there was a political as well as an economic motivation behind the West's promotion of consumerist dreams. Now that the Cold War is over, it is not clear that the working classes in these countries will continue to be wooed by the carrot of commodity consumerism. Production for export is the blueprint for the success of capitalist firms, threatening to make obsolete the Fordist principle of putting dollars into the workers' pockets in order to increase domestic demand. Under the new order of global capitalism, workers in the first world are dispensable. And so are the homes and cities in which they dwell. Benjamin insisted: "We must wake up from the world of our parents."92 But what can be demanded of a new generation, if its parents never dream at all?

In the midst of the chaos, Aleksandr Rodchenko's 1924 poster for Vertov's film Kino-Glaz (Cinema-Eye) offered a glimpse of hope. The "Cinema-Eye" in Rodchenko's famous poster (the right eye, mirroring our Left), advertising the movie of that name, mimics the human eye. Black and white, like the movie that it advertises, it gazes with no clear focus, so that it can be imagined to invert again into the poster, into the two cameras that point downward at the duplicated face of a young boy which, mirrored in reverse, turns upward to return their look.

Rodchenko's mechanically reproduced poster was meant to meet the mass of viewers halfway, moving into their daily life and out again. Its human machine-eye, young and alert, is enthusiastic for the technological future. Prigov's 1991 installation draws on the collective memory-image of this poster, setting up a mimetic loop, into the past. His weeping eye looks backward and remembers.

Dmitrii Prigov's 1991 installation, "For the Poor Cleaning Woman," captures the essence of the era. The curtains are gray, the image of the eye is black and white. Only the tear is red, a socialist tear, the color of blood. A cleaning woman, a mannequin in khaki coat, kneels before the eye on a suprematist black circle. She bows her head in her hands, sobbing, obediently, "for the Poor Cleaning Woman." Her hand tools, broom and bucket, rest behind her. The parquet floor is swept clean. We observe the scene from behind her, outside the mimetic loop of crying eye and crying woman. Still, it is upon us that the aperture of the eye is focused—the left eye, on our right. That aperture makes it a camera eye. And our own gaze at the page on which this scene is reproduced as photograph mirrors this eye, obediently, in return: a third mimetic loop. Paired, these eyes form a face that spans the distance between dream and disillusion—the face of this century.

IV AFTERWARD
A Note on Method
Chapter 6 explains the writing of this book. It tells the story of a small number of intellectuals as they lived through the disintegration of the Cold War world. Some of the characters will be known to the reader, but that is not the point. Rather, it is to demystify the book as knowledge-production by exposing the lived experience behind its pages. This is not a very heroic story. As a friend observed (with Marx's 18th Brumaire of Louis Napoleon in mind), intellectuals and politicians rush back and forth across the stage while the political and economic structures crumble beneath them. That is not a bad description of what we lived through, and I expect that our experience was typical. When intellectual history is treated as self-evolving and self-contained, it is impossible to see that its development as a coherent and meaningful story is an ex post facto construction, that events are more a manifestation of historical accident than historical purpose. At the same time, experiences that appear to the actors to be freely willed are structurally defined and limited by history. These are not contradictory statements. History structures human actions even if it lacks a rational purpose; humans choose freely even when they do not control the meaning of their acts. In the story told here, actors seized the chance, but missed their lines.

Chapter 6 Lived Time/Historical Time

6.1 Losing the Enemy

In Moscow in May 1987, even a foreigner could sense that the myths of revolutionary history were lifting like mist. Old political meanings were being challenged under glasnost'', but what the future held was still anybody's guess. Gorbachev had been General Secretary of the Communist Party since March 1985. Newspapers and television, while in no way governed by market forces, were open to critical reflection and debate. Novelists were publishing manuscripts that had languished in desk drawers for decades. Journals like Novyi Mir (New World) functioned as public forums for discussions of the Soviet past, economic reform, Orthodox religion, and political elections. "Unofficial" art that was exhibited openly at Kutsnetskii Most (which was also the black market for books) included the work of Grisha Brushkin, whose painting Fundamental Lexicon (1976) sold that summer at a Sotheby's auction for £242,000 ($412,828). Moscow television aired the U.S. television special "The Day After," a post-nuclear war melodrama condemning the futility of Cold War military strategy. A young West German pilot flew, unnoticed, across the nuclear-militarized zone and landed his small plane on Red Square without resistance. But if gestures of opposition in the public sphere had become frequent in the Soviet Union, the structures of power were still largely intact. Party hierarchies, bureaucratic bottlenecks, networks for the allocation of scarce resources (apartments, consumer goods, vacation accommodations) persisted during glasnost' much as before. The urban landscape—strikingly green to the Western eye—was still unchanged, its monumental buildings < previous page page_214 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_214.html [21.01.2009 0:34:53]

6.2 Igor Makarevich, "Sotheby's," 1988.

In the story told here, actors seized the chance, but missed their lines. The urban landscape—strikingly green to the Western eye—was still unchanged, its monumental buildings surrounded by "empty" spaces that attested to the absence of capitalist urban land values, its streets and stores denuded of advertisements and all but the smallest of signs, so that the noninitiate walked obliviously past shops, restaurants, and leisure centers. State grocery stores were adequately stocked. Tea, coffee, and sugar were not yet in short supply. Street vendors sold fresh vegetables and strawber______ It must be said that restricted access and networks of privilege made visiting a pleasure for foreign academics. Few in number, we were housed almost exclusively in the Gostinitsa Akademii Nauk (Hotel of the Academy of Sciences), just off Leninskii Prospekt at the Oktiabrskaia metro station. I was there for the first time, accompanying a U.S. physicist who had been invited by the Landau Institute.1 Our two-room suite was comfortable enough, complete with humming refrigerator and black-and-white television. It had abundant pseudo-nineteenth-century furniture and patterned drapes and wallpaper, reflecting the fashionable tastes of high Stalinism. There were politically innocuous pictures on the wall, and a remarkable chandelier constructed from what looked like five glass coffee jars, each screwed into a red plastic base. The bathroom had tiles in three colors, randomly arranged. The large windows leaked only somewhat around the edges. Our sole deprivation, as springtime temperatures dipped into the low forties, was that there was neither heat nor hot water, not only in these rooms, not only in this hotel, but in the entire Moscow district during a several-week period of repairs. Nearby Gorky Park was safe and pleasant. The red brick walls of the Kremlin, failing to measure up to Western photographs, seemed anything but an evil and foreboding fortress. Lenin's mausoleum on Red Square appeared incongruously flanked on one side by the colorful cathedral of St. Basil and on the other by GUM, the three-story, three-hall, iron-and-glass-roofed, late-nineteenth-century, state-owned shopping arcade with commodities sparsely populating the lower floors and noisy birds nesting in the rafters.

As I had just finished the manuscript for a book on Walter Benjamin, a visit to Moscow, capital city of twentieth-century socialism which Benjamin had visited sixty years before, seemed entirely appropriate. My status as a tourist was short-lived, however, due to the network of Moscow's intelligentsia. On the second day, through the family connection of a Landau mathematician, I was brought to the Institute of Philosophy on Volkhonka Street and introduced to a small working group surrounding a young but highly regarded philosopher, Valerii Podoroga, senior researcher at the Sector of the Philosophical Problems of Politics. Podoroga had written his dissertation on Theodor W. Adorno, and we had that in common. He had read my book on Adorno, which was available in the library of the Academy of Sciences, a fact that I found surprising, as they did my appearance with neither official invitation nor the standard peace-group affiliation. Podoroga had been holding a series of increasingly tolerated "underground seminars" at the Institute, in order to consider seriously philosophers and theorists formerly dismissed as "bourgeois": Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger, Freud, Merleau-Ponty, Barthes, Adorno, Benjamin, Foucault. He was not the only person in Moscow writing on European continental philosophy, nor even the only philosopher writing on Adorno. But he and his close associates were unique in appropriating the methods of Western theorists to launch a sustained, critical analysis of Soviet culture. In going beyond a critique of political totalitarianism, this group was breaking new ground. Indebted to the theories of the Frankfurt School and Michel Foucault, their project was to criticize power by philosophizing from cultural phenomena—architectural forms, literary texts, cinematic practices, and modalities of everyday life. At dinner in Podoroga's home, I met Mikhail Ryklin, a philosopher at the Institute and a friend of Podoroga since student days. Ryklin launched into a lecture on Walter Benjamin's "The Origin of German Tragic Drama" in fluent German. He was thoroughly acquainted with French poststructuralism as well. I was impressed by the European language skills of these intellectuals, long isolated from the West. Numerous Institute members, many of whom had never been abroad, addressed me freely in German, French, or English, while I was only beginning to enter the world of Russian script.

The fact that our collective communication reached a level of intellectual rigor was due to the translation skills of Elena Petrovskaia, a young woman working with Podoroga, who as a child had attended the English-speaking United Nations school in New York. Petrovskaia, then writing her dissertation on the image of the Indian as the enemy "Other" in the American intellectual landscape, acted as translator for our official talks and informal conversations. Her American English was flawless, and she transported not only our words but also our souls across the linguistic divide.

There were others whom I came to know during this and subsequent visits: Nellie Matroshilova, head of the Department of the History of Philosophy and an expert in German phenomenology, who would host Juirgen < previous page page 218 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_218.html [21.01.2009 0:34:57] page_219 < previous page page _219 next page > Page 219 Habermas's visit to Moscow the following spring; Mikhail Kuznetsov, specialist in contemporary German philosophy who now writes on the philosophy of computer technology and cyberspace; Tatiana Klimenkova, influenced by Foucault and one of the first Russian philosophers to concern herself with feminist issues; Natasha Avtonomova, the Institute's first researcher in the work of Jacques Derrida; Elena Oznovkina, translator of Husserl into Russian; Dmitrii Khanin, aesthetic philosopher and John Dewey expert, who had first escorted me to the Institute and now teaches Russian Literature at Colgate University—and many more.

But these three personalities would be the pivot around which our subsequent collaboration turned: Valerii Podoroga, idiosyncratic and brilliant, esoteric in a way considered charismatic by his colleagues, at times blunt and bungling—the very prototype of a Russian philosopher; Mikhail Ryklin, openly communicative, fluent in four languages, and impressive in his knowledge of various theoretical traditions which he delighted in parrying with Nietzschean black humor; Elena Petrovskaia, willfully energetic, able to copy an impressionist painting with the same mimetic skill as translate a text, and raised with a precocious confidence from having been at home on both sides of the Cold War world. Their personalities gave expression to the various objective possibilities that existed at the time. Page 220

The fact that I had been schooled in Western Marxism had everything to do with my desire to enter into a collaboration. And yet this Marxist orientation was of little interest to my Moscow counterparts.3 Granted, at the level of the Academy of Sciences, philosophers had been exposed to a sophistication of Marxist theory lacking in the ideology of Marxist-Leninism. (The general Soviet public did not read Marx himself.) The French Marxist Louis Althusser visited the Institute of Philosophy during the Brezhnev years; the rehabilitation of the Hungarian Georg Lukacs had been signaled by a recent translation of his aesthetic theory. But these thinkers spoke to an older generation than the one with whom I was becoming involved. In the Soviet Union, the shestidesiatniki or "sixties generation" was that of Petrovskaia's parents and, indeed, of Gorbachev himself. They were born in Stalin's time, their childhood experiences were of war, they came to maturity during the era of Khrushchev's reforms. As students they discovered the writings of the young, humanist Marx, and many later sympathized with the spirit of the Prague Spring of 1968—the call for "socialism with a human face."4 There was a time lag between this sixties generation and the one that I had encountered as a student in the United States and Germany at the very end of the decade. Podoroga and Ryklin, my peers, considered themselves already beyond the neo-Marxism of the Gorbachev generation. But if their politics differed from mine, the terms of our critical analyses were close. We understood culture as fundamentally political, operating on the body in a material sense. The machinery of modern power was not so much hidden behind the ideology of mass utopia as it was produced by it. Intrinsic to the politics of modernity was the potential for the abuse of power against the collective, and at the same time in its name. These were problems that neither Western capitalism nor Soviet socialism had managed to resolve.

I returned to Cornell and started formal study of Russian, committed to a sustained collaboration, though how such a project would be financed was far from clear. U.S. government funding during the Cold War was geared to area studies, and I was neither a Soviet nor a Russian specialist. Page 221:

Moreover, the critique of problems of power common to both systems was hardly a Cold War research priority. The MacArthur Foundation was receptive to less typical projects, however, and we were grateful for its funding on several occasions. The first was for a reciprocal exchange of visitors to take place in early 1988. It necessitated obtaining official permission from the Soviet side, which I had bypassed on my first visit, and access to which meant passing through the red-curtained, bookless offices of the high-placed bureaucrats of the Academy. Their power, it was rumored, was in inverse proportion to their scholarly productivity, and any request that was not their own initiative was met with suspicion. Our exchange was to entail, as the first stage, a January visit to Moscow by a two-woman team, myself and Nancy Ries, a Cornell graduate student of anthropology who specialized in Soviet culture. That two women alone wished to comprise an official delegation was enough to raise eyebrows; that an anthropologist wanted to do field work in civilized Moscow was close to a scandal.

The second part of the proposed exchange, to bring younger members of the Institute to Cornell in April, went clearly against protocol, as the list approved for travel to the West generally did not reach below department heads. As one Moscow friend put it: "It is a firm conviction that only chiefs of the tribe are to enter the Wonderland." Just weeks before our January visit, official invitations for Ries and myself arrived. Podoroga's and Petrovskaia's permission to travel to Cornell was granted, likewise, at the eleventh hour. But the authorities did yield, setting a precedent on which we would rely in the future.

I spent the fall of 1988 preparing a series of lectures analyzing problematic aspects of the common, radical democratic heritage of our political systems, and delivered them at the Institute of Philosophy in January-February 1989. In May and June I was back in Moscow to give talks in Podoroga's "underground seminar" and lecture on Walter Benjamin at the Belorussian University in Minsk.

Plans were made for a special Benjamin issue of the Soviet Yearbook of Philosophy for 1990, published by the Academy of Sciences, that would include the first Russian translations of his works (sections from his "Moscow Diary," among others), and contributions by Podoroga and myself.

The group around Podoroga coalesced into a working collective, continuing to develop a political critique of Soviet culture and expanding to attract philosophers from Minsk, the Baltic republics, and Bulgaria, as well as Moscow intellectuals and artists from outside the Institute. Western visitors became more frequent. I urged Fredric Jameson to contact Podoroga's group when he went to Moscow in October 1988, and he became an integral part of our collaboration.

Jürgen Habermas's official visit to the Institute of Philosophy took place in April 1989. A trip to Paris in that month allowed me to make preliminary arrangements with Jacques Derrida for a visit to the Institute the following spring. My trips back and forth (and consequent access to reliable telephone and mail communication) made it possible to help organize two events initiated by members of the Institute that one year earlier would not have taken place. The first was an International Conference on Martin Heidegger, held on October 17-19, 1989, to celebrate his hundredth birthday. This conference broke traditional rules by including young philosophers and dispensing with the traditional Marxist-Leninist ideological framing. The younger Russian philosophers saw Heidegger as a fundamental departure from the intellectual lineage of Hegel-Marx-Lenin.

A debate ensued during the conference, rehearsing the "case of Heidegger" and his Nazi connection. V. N. Bibichin made the telling reply that the whole issue was not very significant; Nazi or no, Heidegger was indisputably "bourgeois," and what was truly remarkable in the Moscow context was the fact that he was being discussed seriously at all.

In January 1990, with the official title of "Co-Chairwoman of the International Soviet-French-American Symposium," the author was back in Moscow with Jean-Luc Nancy for a workshop of deconstruction. Derrida's ten-day visit took place in April. He was hosted by Podoroga, who had risen to considerable institutional power as head of a newly created institute sector: the Laboratory for the Study of Post-Classical Philosophy, Literature, and Art. Derrida was accompanied by his wife, a professional psychoanalyst who spoke Russian.

Derrida drew crowds at the Institute and at Moscow State University, with young students understanding that Derrida was a "scandal." His visit took place during the anniversary of Stalin's death, which was when "specters of Marx" first appeared to him. He has since written about this trip in an essay entitled "Back from Moscow, in the USSR."

When the author and Ries visited in January 1989, Gorbachev was at the height of his power. Confirmed as President of the Supreme Soviet in October, he maintained his position as General Secretary of the Communist Party. In March, he called for elections in a 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies, a new institution that was to function as a lower house of the legislature. When the author returned to Moscow in May and June, the new Congress was in session, with deputies defining themselves as an autonomous political unit. Page 224:

Debates on the floor were televised live from the Kremlin, reaching audiences in Eastern Europe as well. The issues discussed included economic reform, ethnic autonomy, ecological damage, putting an end to one-party rule, and criticisms of the unpopular Afghanistan war which had recently been concluded. These proceedings were followed enthusiastically by an addicted public. Few workplaces lacked a television tuned in constantly to the Congress of People's Deputies. People went strolling in the park with portable radios held to their ears. It was in fact thrilling to witness the construction of a democratic public sphere. Even with access to power still funneled through party membership, there was a wonderful freshness to political life, and a sense of public participation that was direct and unpretentious.19

I remember standing by the metro entrance at Red Square at the end of the day's session and observing the deputies (multiethnic, mainly young, women as well as men) walking across the square to take the metro home (there were no black limousines in sight). They were buttonholed freely by people waiting to take up with them issues they had just been debating on TV. As a working principle, glasnost' had come to mean: "Whatever is not expressly prohibited is allowed." The television show Vzgliad (Glance) interviewed disgruntled Afghanistan War veterans, and instructed viewers on how to shop on the black market by discerning the difference between forged Levi Strauss bluejeans and the real thing. In 1989 the hit movie was Malenkaia Vera (Little Vera), which depicted alienated youth and featured explicit sex.20

We had a special viewing of it at the Institute of Philosophy as part of the latter's newly established Film Club. There was round-table discussion at the Dom Kino (House of Cinema) on the topic: "Umer li Marx?" (Is Marx Dead?) The answer—yes—might, I felt, be considered healthily materialist. By the summer of 1989, Gorbachev was confronting organized challenges to his leadership from groups claiming that his program of perestroika did not go far enough. On July 10, coal miners in Siberia went on strike, protesting against deteriorating working and living conditions. On July 30, approximately three hundred dissident deputies, including Boris Yeltsin21 and Andrei Sakharov,22 formed an Inter-Regional Group of People's Deputies that organized the unofficial opposition. On August 18, the fiftieth anniversary of the Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact (the secret protocols of which had given Stalin the green light to annex the Baltic states), a human chain of a million demonstrators spanned the four hundred miles from Tallinn through Riga to Vilnius in protest against continued Soviet domination. When I arrived in October for the Heidegger Conference, enthusiasm for Gorbachev among the intelligentsia had been tempered, whereas Yeltsin, formerly a figure of derision due to his well-publicized drinking bouts, was just back from a legitimizing trip to the United States and was beginning to be taken seriously. The policies of perestroika (market reform within the framework of the socialist economy and democratic reform within a one-party political system) were openly challenged as insufficient. Increasingly, Gorbachev was forced to undermine the bases of his own power. In contrast, Yeltsin's call for "Russian" autonomy in opposition to "Soviet" imperialism was producing a new discourse of political legitimation. This enabled Yeltsin to build his own power base on the same ethnic principle that supported the demands of the Baltic states and ethnic minorities within Russia. Gorbachev, the leader of the "imperial" Soviet Union, found little space for himself in this political topology.

On November 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall was opened. The subsequent toppling of socialist regimes in Eastern Europe undermined Gorbachev's domestic power, though it made him popular as an international celebrity. His global superstardom was achieved by weakening the Soviet Union's traditional image internationally, feeding off a different economy of power than functioned at home.

Yeltsin's populism was also thoroughly problematic. While democratic in form, the principle of ethnic autonomy was seriously deficient in terms of democratic content. Resentment in the Baltic states against the indigenous Russian population was already making clear.

In this situation, even the most progressive intellectuals at the Institute of Philosophy followed a time-honored tradition of keeping their distance from politics, speaking out as "god's fool" in opposition to established power. However, political organizing of even grassroots movements was an altogether foreign idea. This refusal to act politically, stemming from deep-seated distrust and cynicism regarding every aspect of public power and every form of utopian politics, became a contested point between the author and the intellectual.

The fall of the Berlin Wall affected the nature of their intellectual relationship. Surprisingly, it made collaboration more difficult. Their interest had been in criticizing the past of their respective cultures, using the same theoretical tools to analyze those structures of modern power that had done violence to humanity on both sides of the great divide. The commonality of that project seemed to depend on the very divide that it sought to transcend. In June 1989, the Communist Party was defeated resoundingly in Poland's elections. Hungary's Roundtable met throughout the summer to negotiate a peaceful transition to a multiparty system. East Germany began to topple in September, Czechoslovakia in October, Bulgaria in November, and Romania in December. The League of Yugoslav Communists disintegrated in early 1990. German reunification occurred in spring 1990. These events caused a collapse of structures of signification that had profound effects worldwide. And yet they were not revolutions. The images of dazed and drinking Germans on top of the Berlin Wall gave the world a rush of freedom, but provided little vision of the content of what was to come. The photograph released of Ceausescu's bloody corpse functioned as a sign almost in the commercial sense, advertising the perpetrators as revolutionaries, rather than marking true social change. Satellite television played an unprecedented role as witness, attesting to the reality of change, a situation that encouraged the staging of "revolutionary" events, as if massive social transformation were a matter of gaining access to airtime. It is remarkable how strategically significant television stations became. Their takeover was the contemporary version of storming the Bastille or the Winter Palace.

To claim that the "bloodless" (or "velvet" or "glorious") revolutions of 1989 were in fact no revolution at all is not simply to disagree with how others have defined the term. I am in no way denying what many have argued, that the self-conscious articulation of a "civil society," in opposition to the authoritarian regimes, created a public space in which the power of citizen protest achieved a momentous wave of reforms, culminating in the overthrow of the old guard of Communist leaders. But these new forms of civil society—Poland's Solidarity union, East Germany's New Forum, Czechoslovakia's Civic Forum, Hungary's Opposition Roundtable, the peace and ecology movement—were produced within the old regimes, rather than being the consequence of their defeat.

The first free elections < previous page page_228 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CDY%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_228.html [21.01.2009 0:35:06] page_229 < previous page page_229 next page > Page 229 were organized by members of the radical wing of the Communist Party itself, although in many cases they were digging their own political graves. The tens of thousands of persons marching in the Leipzig demonstrations of September 25 and October 2 sang the "Internationale" as well as "We Shall Overcome." Alexander Dubcek *, veteran of the Prague Spring, who on November 20 stood so unforgettably next to Vaclav Havel waving to crowds in Wenceslas Square, had been the author of the doctrine of socialism with a human face, not a proponent of socialism's demise. The real surge of critical political energy, including the great dissident literature, belongs to the period before the fall of the Wall. The dissolution of critical thinking began almost immediately thereafter, and it is striking how little original thought subsequently emerged. There was no widespread intellectual renaissance, no cultural rebirth, but rather a recycling of earlier dissident literature, followed by a spate of translations of Western texts. With the collapse of Eastern Europe into the outstretched arms of the West, what was advertised as revolution turned out to be something quite different: economic incorporation—not into the European Community on somewhat equal terms, but into a global capitalist system already in the process of restructuring according to neoliberal rules that marked the end of an era of social democracy. Brazil, not Sweden, was the model of the postsocialist future. Page 230

6.2 One World

It was during this period of the dismantling of Eastern European regimes that we planned our longest and largest collaboration, a two-week "course" to be held in October 1990 at the Inter-University Centre in Dubrovnik. For several decades, the Centre's courses had played a unique role as a meeting place for scholars and students from the West and Eastern Europe, but up until then, no Soviets had participated. That situation changed when Dr. V. S. Stepin, Director of the Moscow Institute of Philosophy, traveled to Yugoslavia in spring 1989 to negotiate arrangements with the Centre. Coincidentally, I was also at the Dubrovnik Centre attending a course on critical theory,26 and we discussed the feasibility of a new course co-directed by Valerii Podoroga and myself. A month later, when I was back in Moscow, plans for a Dubrovnik course began in earnest. Two further directors were added: Luchezar Boiadzhiev, a young Bulgarian at the Institute of Art Studies in Sofia, whose colleague, Vladislav Todorov, had been with us as a long-term visitor to Podoroga's Laboratory, and Fredric Jameson, whose intellect and enthusiasm provided enormous momentum for the project.27 Invited participants represented a variety of theoretical positions. They included Boris Groys, who had left the Soviet Union for West Germany in 1981 and whose book Gesammtkunstwerk Stalin (Stalin's Total Artwork) put forward the bold thesis that Stalin had ironically carried into effect the plans of the very artistic avant-garde whom he had suppressed; Wolfgang Fritz Haug from West Berlin, Marxist philosopher and editor of the journal Das Argument, whose most recent work was a pro-perestroika diary of the Gorbachev year June 1989–May 1990 (Das Perestroika-Journal),; Helena Kozakiewicz, a "Western" Marxist philosopher from the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology in Warsaw,28 critic of both the old Communist regime and Solidarity's coalition government that had replaced it following elections unduly influenced by the United States; Peter Madsen, literary theorist from the University of Copenhagen, committed, in the tradition of the Frankfurt School, to rescuing critical reason from anti-Enlightenment attacks; Merab Mamardashvili, a renowned Georgian philosopher of the Soviet sixties generation who had courageously gone against the grain of official dogma to develop his own French-influenced, existentialist philosophy, and who had been the inspirational teacher of both Ryklin and Podoroga; and Slavoj Zizek*, Slovenian-Lacanian-Hegelian-postmodernist theorist, trained in Paris, who taught in the United States and had recently run unsuccessfully for president of Slovenia.

Once the regimes in Eastern Europe began to topple, the original working title for the course, "Dismantling the Cold War Discourse," seemed inadequate. We renamed it "Modern Problems of Power and Culture," under which general rubric we might integrate on a long-term basis the efforts of Eastern and Western scholars to reassess the modern project (it was expected that successful Dubrovnik courses would continue meeting in future years).

6.5 Polish Solidarity Party election poster, 1989, by Jan Andrez Gorny and Pawel Zazac.29 We still needed a specific title for the first two-week meeting in October 1990. Aware that the act of naming was still an issue of political sensitivity in the Soviet Union, I left the choice up to my Moscow friends. They surprised me with the title, "Philosophical Problems of Postmodern Discourse," which clearly implied that it was the times that were postmodern, not merely the West's discursive forms. Although the choice no longer seems remarkable, at that time it was a radical intellectual move.

Until then, even among its proponents and critics (of whom Jameson was one of the most articulate), postmodernity was understood as a condition specific to (late) capitalism and its consumerist, simulacral cultural forms. The inclusion of (late) socialist culture within this term should not have surprised me, as I had been arguing persistently for the commonalities of our roots in Western modernity, and "post-" modernity would seem to follow logically as the next step.

But such a logical step was in fact a construction of history, not its description. The gesture of including Soviet experience within the meaning of postmodernism was a moment in the process of ideological formation. It had the effect of universalizing the claims of postmodernism as a theoretical discourse with explanatory power, and gave this term pretensions of general legitimacy.

Now it was not just a question of a postmodern school of architecture or art existing among other contending schools, nor, as Jameson argued, of a "dominant cultural logic" of late capitalism, but of all contemporary cultures expressing the same "postmodern" world. In short, postmodernism, up until then a phenomenon within the cultural field, was becoming naturalized as the name of the cultural field, no longer a particular theoretical positioning but the description of a new historical stage.

It is clear to me now, although it was not then, that this moment was part of a hegemonic shift in intellectual discourse that was global in scope. Although the term is now so broadly used to describe our age that it is accepted as second nature, it is important to remember that there was nothing self-evident about this outcome: "postmodernism" was not a historical inevitability.

From the Soviet side, the options of moving toward ethnic traditionalism, or of backing the old Communist Party in the hopes that it would transform itself from within, seemed far more dubious. Moreover, in terms of postmodern culture there were ways one could argue that the Soviet Union was in advance of the rest of the world, having attained this new historical stage before the capitalist West. Political cynicism, anti-utopianism, and distrust of all totalizing discourses were not these characteristics of postmodernity already well established in Soviet dissident culture as part of the intellectual legacy of de-Stalinization? "Dubrovnik" became a floating signifier for multiple and various desires. The postcard image of the city shimmered in our dream consciousness as the goal and a new beginning, although no one quite knew what. The city, the sea, the air did not disappoint we-we had little foreboding of the precariousness of the old town's tranquillity. But the pleasures of sensory immediacy made the problematic aspects of our 6.6 Dubrovnik, the old city, postcard, 1990. page_233 file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_233.html [21.01.2009 0:35:10] page_234 < previous page page_234 next page > Page 234 communication all the more disappointing. There were first of all structural inequalities. The official language of the Centre was English, which, especially for the younger Moscow participants who had never attended an international conference, tipped the intellectual power balance toward the West. Accommodations and rates were lower for Eastern participants, but those on full pension were excluded from dinners in town. Per diem stipends for the Soviets were paid in dollars which many preferred to keep, so that even a sociable coffee or a beer was foregone so as not to squander the hard currency. The Soviets rightly chafed under their second-class economic status (a portent of things to come). I had an uneasy feeling that the list of invited participants was taking on the qualities of a new nomenklatura. Some Eastern Europeans felt that the whole conception of the course replicated the superpower dominance which they had hoped was a thing of the past. But the greatest moments of frustration were within the intellectual exchange itself. The term "postmodernism" was a source of dispute. The young Bulgarian participants, Luchezar Boiadzhiev, Ivailo Dichev, and Vladislav Todorov, whose collaborative contribution was a piece of performance art that featured the mummified founders of the Communist states, were fully comfortable with "postmodernism" as a synonym for their own "post-communist condition." Merab Mamardashvili disliked the term intensely, calling it a form of "cultural stupidity" because its celebration of the failure of reason "gave up the philosophical battle" and denied the right to think. The questions of what to think and what to do, he claimed, were always new because the world changed, but to describe this world as "postmodern" was a choice, and hence ultimately an ethical decision: "You don't have to become postmodern."32 Helena Kozakiewicz criticized postmodernity from the opposite perspective, that of a critical sociology of knowledge which stressed the social and historical determinants of postmodern discourse as ideology. Peter Madsen warned against the postmodern oversimplification of modernism's extremely varied reactions to the process of < previous page page_234 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_234.html [21.01.2009 0:35:11] page_235 page_235 Page 235 modernization, ranging from rationalism to surrealism. Natasha Avtonomova cautioned us to distinguish in our own work between investigation and creation, preferring the humbler claims of the former to the arbitrariness of the latter, of which postmodernism could be seen as an example. My own plea was to seize the term "postmodern" and reappropriate it for the purposes of a common critical strategy—the project that had been the original impetus of our own collaboration. But my Moscow colleagues were now resistant. Rather than stressing what was common to the methods and substance of our critiques of modern power, they seemed compelled to emphasize the differences, despite the fact that we were considering cultural phenomena that the East and West had shared during the process of industrial modernization: early cinema, urban architecture, mass leaders, media manipulation, the mass-utopian myth of industrial "modernization" itself. We had purposely decided to focus at Dubrovnik on objects of visual culture because these might be more easily accessible to a common analysis across language differences. But shared vision turned out to be as difficult as shared language.

Looking at the same images, we did not see the same things. Mikhail Ryklin read the iconography of the Moscow metro—which to any New Yorker must appear glorious—as the epitome of Stalinist terror. Valerii Podoroga interpreted the work of the Bolshevik filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein, idol of the Western avant-garde, as giving cinematic expression to the sadomasochistic body produced by Stalin's machinery of power. Boris Groys condemned the entire aesthetic avant-garde, East and West, as the precursor to the Stalinist "aesthetic" project of creating a new society. Vladislav Todorov found a similar aesthetics in Soviet economic practices, in the sense that factories were organized to produce ideology, not products, fabricating the fabulous "working class" as the party's own missing constituency.

Against their absolute rejection of the past, Haug, Jameson, and I were intent on criticizing the dream forms of both capitalism and socialism from within in order to salvage the transcendent moment to which they gave expression. Jameson tried to encourage the reconsideration of our position as intellectuals by means of a new cognitive mapping that would describe the postmodern condition self-critically, from the inside, not only as a cultural style but as an economic system and a life-world (in which "cities are modified, bodies are modified"), in order to articulate a leftist politics adequate to the present.

We had prepared in advance to discuss one literary text in common, a section of Andrei Platonov's novel The Foundation Pit. During this discussion, Podoroga began to insist that we simply could not understand the novel without access to both the experience of Stalinism and Platonov's use of the Russian language. His exclusionary hermeneutics were rejected by Western participants unwilling to cede the debate to arguments of national difference. But in our own critiques of capitalism, our neo-Marxist categories remained largely unmodified despite sea-changes in the global political and economic situation. We seemed, generally, to be reviving the official Neither side seemed willing to give ground in this carnivalesque performance of Cold War rhetoric. Tempers grew short. An incident in which gender relations collided with power relations brought me to the boiling point.35

Peter Madsen pleaded with us in Habermasian terms to "be reasonable!" Jameson later described the dynamics this way: "Unfortunately, Cold War anticommunism has lavishly supplied all possible and imaginable stereotypes... so that even experiential truth from the East now looks indistinguishable, not merely from media commonplaces and simulacra, but from its most ancient Cold War forms. ... The more their truths are couched in Orwellian language, the more tedious they become for us; the more our truths demand expression in even the weakest forms of Marxian language—that of simple social democracy, say, or even the welfare state or social justice, or equality—the more immediately do the Eastern hearing aids get switched off."36

And further: "To put it briefly, the East wishes to talk in terms of power and oppression; the West in terms of culture and commodification. There are really no common denominators in this initial struggle for discursive rules, and what we end up with is the inevitable comedy of each side muttering irrelevant replies in its own favourite language."37

Jameson's suggestion that this incompatibility of languages was simply an extension (and reversal) of the dualisms of the Cold War past was not a sufficient explanation. In the Soviet case, the individuals making these (Cold War-like arguments, Podoroga and Ryklin, were experts in precisely those forms of critical theory that had been created as a critique of Western modernity, and the very gesture of adopting them to criticize Soviet cultural life was an admission of the commonalities of manipulative, mass-culture forms. Podoroga's description of the "cosmocratic utopia" of Platonov's Foundation Pit as a "catastrophical machine of power" (the book, he emphasized, had important similarities to the novels of Kafka and other non-Russian writers) was expressly indebted to the work of Mumford, Deleuze, and Guattari;38 Ryklin's interpretation of the Moscow metro iconography used Bakhtin's conception of the collective folk-body against the grain of what he knew was accepted interpretation in the West, not positively, as "a hymn to the common man"39 but dystopically, as "horror incarnate."40

Our difficulties in communicating need to be understood within the constellation of political events in which the Dubrovnik meeting took place. Every socialist regime of Eastern Europe had collapsed. We were meeting in a "post-socialist" country on the brink of civil war. Only in the Soviet Union was Communist Party rule still intact, and even here its power was shaken. Our problem was not that we were still living in different worlds. Rather, our worlds were fast becoming one, on terms that made critical thinking precarious for reasons other than political censorship, and theoretical collaboration problematic for reasons other than cultural difference. While we had been working to criticize the dreams of the past, we were living through the disappearance of a dream of the present—specifically (and it was one of the dreamworlds of modernity) the dream that each side had about the other. Dreamworlds are not merely illusions. In insisting that what is is not all there is, they are assertions of the human spirit and, invaluable politically, they make the momentous claim that the world we have known since childhood is not the only one imaginable. For critical intellectuals from the East, the existence of a nonsocialist West sustained the dream that there could be "normalcy" in social life. For their counterparts in the West, the existence of the noncapitalist East sustained the dream that the Western capitalist system was not the only possible form of modern production.

Of course, we each knew that our hopes were not realized in any perfect way by the other side. But the mere fact of the existence of a different system was proof enough to allow us to think the dream possible—something "normal" outside one's own system, which allowed one to describe the latter's internal logic as preposterous; some other social organization of human existence that allowed one to think that the given state of things was not natural or inevitable, so that history could still be envisioned as a space of human freedom.

The possibility of difference is the prerequisite for critical thinking, which, distinct from science, is not content to identify what is. It was this possibility that was threatened by the coming together of our worlds. Their merging was not the convergence that Sakharov had predicted in the 1960s, the felicitous scenario of both sides moving toward some democratic-socialist middle ground. Rather, the Second World was disappearing into the First World at the same time that the ideals of socialism were going under even in their Western democratic forms.

In this context, the Soviets' insistence on the absolute uniqueness and incomprehensibility for the West of their own modern horrors was an expression of hope. If really existing socialism was merely one variant of modernism, then its collapse into the other variant could only lead to the most pessimistic conclusions. And it was impossible for them to embrace our own Marxist discourse as an alternative without being led in a circle, in terms of the history of their own cultural context, back to the very intellectual constraints that critical thinking had enabled them to escape.

The irony, of course, is that Marx, while a rather poor theorist of socialism, had developed one of the most powerful and cogent critiques of that capitalist system which the East was entering, yet it was precisely not as Marxist criticism that a protest against incorporation could be raised. Not all texts are legible at all times; censorship can exist even without political constraint.

Elena Petrovskaia gives an everyday example:

I well remember how at the very start of perestroika, random passers-by were interviewed by TV reporters—they were asked to give their opinion of what was going on around them, be it changing politics or, perhaps, their daily problems. And many seemed completely at a loss: not because they had nothing to say, but because there were no words to say it with. The old media-inspired cliches, something like "we fully approve and support," were sensed as absolutely inappropriate. When the structuring topology between words and the world undergoes a seismic shift, it may happen that the truth cannot be said. Certain phrases, certain discourses become inaccessible, while others may suddenly reemerge with new power. To speak of a crisis in language sounds idealist, yet it can be a profoundly concrete historical experience. At Dubrovnik, Slavoj Zizek described such a crisis as central to the events in Eastern Europe, but in this case, the critically powerful moment came from arguing for an identity between language and reality, reviving the moribund discourse of socialism itself. The attempt by radical groups in Slovenia and elsewhere to close the gap between socialist ideology and socialist reality by taking the old ideology at its word, paradoxically forced the political situation wide open. Zizek described the "inherently tragical ethical dimension" of those who "took socialism seriously" and whose role was that of the "vanishing mediator," a term he borrowed from Jameson:

They were prepared to put everything at stake in order to destroy the compromised system and replace it with the utopian "third way" beyond capitalism and "really existing" socialism. Their sincere belief and insistence that they were not working for the restoration of Western capitalism, of course, proved to be nothing but an insubstantial illusion; however, we could say that precisely as such (as a thorough illusion without substance) it was stricto sensu nonideological: it didn't "reflect" in an inverted-ideological form any actual relations of power. Zizek spoke of his experience in Slovenia: "We witnessed a kind of opening; things were for a moment visible which immediately became invisible." This moment of contingency and choice allowed space for political agency. But the rhetoric of "taking socialism seriously" was not strong enough to prevent the collapse of that space under the weight of a new ruling ideology, a political myth that immediately rendered invisible "the open, undecided process of its own founding"—the myth of the ethnic nation.

The ontology of national belonging bypasses the crisis of language because identities, fixed from the start, are not an issue for debate. One's mere being—the accident of birth—determines one's status as friend or foe, so that there is not any need to speak at all. The outburst of postsocialist nationalism in Yugoslavia and elsewhere, claimed Zizek, was produced out of the logic of Western capitalism, rather than being external to it. It is an attempt to cover over capitalism's basic social antagonisms and "inherent structural imbalance" by imposing "community" (actually the old communist theme) upon it. It is in fact "the fascist dream," the "impossible" desire for "capitalism cum Gemeinschaft, a desire for capitalism without the ‘alienated’ civil society, without the formal-external relations between individuals." Zizek concluded: "The only way to prevent the emergence of protofascist nationalist hegemony is to call into question the very standard of 'normality,' the universal framework of liberal-democratic capitalism—as was done, for a brief moment, by the 'vanishing mediators' in the passage from socialism into capitalism." Once the transition was under way, however, talk of a "third way" appeared futile, a "heroic daydream." The antagonisms became invisible and the system closed again. Ivailo Dichev's presentation at Dubrovnik described the Bulgarian experience: In [the communist] world, you could at least take sides and engage in the struggle led by the situations of desire. But what if you start suspecting that both conflicting representations [East and West] are produced by the same author, that is by power? The ambiguity of your position is multiplied by two, you not only do not know which of the conflicting representations to choose, but also whether to choose at all, whether the choice is real, or something like Descartes' demon is cheating you.51

 Page 242

Dichev's revealing description of the bleakness of the postcommunist situation, as it appeared to someone unwilling to accept the pseudo-community of ethnic nationalism, deserves to be cited at length: [Postcommunism] is a sort of postmodern condition not only because the great discourses of liberation are behind . . . but also because there is no more nature left to come back to. Common sense will object that there exists the normal capitalist world, which represents nature; and really you do not find an "author" behind capitalism in the way the revolutionaries of different types are the authors of communist society. But what is the nature of this nature? ... Capitalism, [Georg Lukdcs] insists, has to be based on an overcalculating individual behavior and an irrational whole. There cannot be a project of capitalism nor some sense of the whole; its only principle is, rather, the negation of transcendence [of the given situation].... Looking West for the natural, post-communist countries see nothing. There exists a vast number of means to solve problems of situations but no representation of ends, no idea of the meaning of the whole. .. . Post-communist countries today are haunted by the idea that there was nothing symbolic in the defeat of communism. Tzvetan Todorov wrote that the feeling was like what happened to the woman in Maupassant's story: she borrowed a necklace and lost it, and then worked her whole life to pay its price, only to find out that the pearls were a cheap imitation and that she had ruined her life in vain. Actually it was even worse, as everyone realized the project of communism was but an act of will; on both sides of the Berlin Wall they knew it was not a symbolic reality [in the sense of being] something imposed on men by God or the likethey knew it was a "political decision." The Wall separated neither nations, nor cultures, nor natures of some sort; it was absolutely arbitrary, running between towns, houses, households: it vanished into thin air (except for souvenirs and tourist-guidebooks), as if it had never existed. Thus there is nothing to learn from the fall of communism, no moral to be taken. The enemy left no corpse behind—you have ruined economies, killed people, polluted land, but the transcendence as artefact [communism's "act of will"] is nowhere to be seen; the will to power disappeared in being defeated and one could ask oneself whether one's life had been real at all.52 The so-called transition to capitalism that followed the fall of socialism was an impoverished substitute for the ideal of revolutionary transcen Page 243

The Catastrophe

243

The confusion in defining the new political terrain using old binaries like radical and conservative, "left" and "right," led to a lack of new meaning for political life. Attempts to fit present-day communists and ethnic nationalists into these binaries only created confusion. The Soviet Communist Party's focus on consumer abundance further muddled the situation. The idea of a "postmodern" spirit in political discourse dismisses the responsibility of thinking through complexities of the present. Mamardashvili's warning about the critical, repeated task of philosophical questioning suggests the importance of always starting anew.

Three months later, I was in Moscow, attending the last Soviet International Film Festival. The event was held outside of Moscow, in Otradnoe, a party retreat still controlled by Gorbachev. The festival featured "Great European Films Unknown in the USSR" and a major Fritz Lang retrospective. The sense of isolation was not overcome, as we were on a political island, a "Soviet" enclave within "Russian" territory. Yeltsin's resignation from the Communist Party following his spring election as President of the Russian Federation marked a dramatic divorce from the old form of political legitimation. Having won the election on a platform of "real economic and political sovereignty" for Russia, Gorbachev's popularity forced him to negotiate plans for economic and political restructuring. Gorbachev and Yeltsin initially worked cooperatively on the "Shatalin Plan," a 500-day timetable for a transition to a market economy. However, the version Gorbachev presented to the Supreme Soviet excluded the timetable and preserved more central authority over banking, taxation, and currency. It was approved on October 19. Twelve days later, the Parliament of the Russian Federation (which supplied 80 percent of the Soviet budget) voted for immediate implementation of the original Shatalin Plan, marking a challenge to Soviet sovereignty.

On the issue of political restructuring, Gorbachev agreed in principle to negotiate a new Union treaty, but his plan for a Soviet federation modeled on the United States stopped far short of the national independence that Lithuania had already claimed in March. Among those opposing Gorbachev's federal plan, some questioned the legitimacy of the Soviet Union itself. Alarmed pro-Soviet forces pressured Gorbachev to resist change, and the positions had polarized, leaving Gorbachev caught in between.

On December 20, Eduard Shevardnadze resigned as Soviet Foreign Minister, warning that reactionary forces threatened the Soviet Union with renewed dictatorship. When J arrived in Moscow on January 12, 1991, tensions resulting from the struggle between Gorbachev and Yeltsin for Russian (and particularly Moscow's) political support were palpable. The thematics of the Film Festival symposium were intended to be conciliatory, with various USSR "nationalities" represented in their own right. However, the Moldovans, particularly, used the symposium as an oppositional forum, calling for their own independent national cinema.

The politics at the symposium were fully at odds with the new capitalist realities of global film production and distribution that were described in several presentations. Podoroga and Ryklin, participants at the symposium, were saddened by the sudden death of Mamardashvili and embittered by efforts to claim him, posthumously, as a great "Georgian" philosopher by politicians who had made his life so difficult all along.

My contribution to the symposium was an attempt to work within and against Podoroga's Dubrovnik presentation on Eisenstein by considering, in comparative and historical context, the connection between cinematic representations of the masses and the perceptual violence of the cinema eye, again insisting on a commonality between Eastern and Western forms of modern mass culture. However, commonality was precisely what many of the Soviet participants least wanted to acknowledge. What concerned them was the present, and the increasing influence of "Western mass culture" that threatened to trivialize Soviet cinema, which had striven for greatness as an art form from the historical epics of Eisenstein to the contemporary metaphysical works of Tarkovskii and Sokhurov. The screening at this symposium of a young director's film, "Stalin in Africa," a spoof about training a Stalin look-alike so that he could make the trip to Africa while the real Stalin stayed home, and ending with the non sequitur of contemporary footage shot from a car riding down New York's Broadway by night, was received with stony silence. I was the only one to speak, supporting the director's effort. He responded, rather, to the silence of his compatriots, and without humor or irony made a self-confession of "hooliganism." It was clear that political differences had worked their way into cultural policy, and that here, too, the situation had become polarized.

There was no agreement among those present as to how much influence from the new, globalized cinema was desirable, or how one ought to evaluate the early Soviet film avant-garde given the changing contemporary conditions. Annette Michelson from the United States, who for several decades had done pathbreaking archival work in Moscow on early Soviet cinema, continued to argue for the politically critical power of the Bolshevik avant-garde, but others took the same position as Groys, claiming that the political commitment of early Soviet cinema culminated logically in the cultural politics of Stalinism. The extreme disparity of views among the participants made the sessions politically revealing.

But the symposium was entirely overshadowed by historical events. On January 13, KGB elite troops were dispatched to Lithuania and attacked the Vilnius radio and television center, attempting a pro-Soviet putsch on behalf of the so-called "Lithuanian National Salvation Committee." Fourteen persons were killed and 580 wounded in the assault. On January 16, just three days later, President Bush ordered the bombing of Baghdad and the United States was at war with Iraq. It was difficult for us not to believe that these events had been coordinated.59 It appeared at the least that both former Cold War opponents were willing to close an eye to the activities of the other. The simultaneity of the events made us wonder how far apart we still were in our instinctive political reactions. My colleagues responded with immediate alarm to the tragedy of the events in Lithuania, whereas I, with my enthusiasm for glasnost', was willing to give Gorbachev the benefit of the doubt regarding the degree of his involvement. Nor could they appreciate how troubling it was for me to witness the reassembly of the patriotic war machine of American power that had been challenged only by so much citizen effort during the Vietnam War.60 It was the way television mediated these events that made the experience so distressing. The telltale sign to my colleagues of Gorbachev's complicity in the Lithuanian crackdown was the fact that the Moscow evening news program, Vremia, reverted almost immediately to the propagandistic rhetoric and visual censorship of the pre-glasnost era. What was most upsetting to me was the complicity of the supposedly independent voice of CNN with U.S. government propaganda. Page 247:

S. government policy, so that the chauvinistic language of television coverage folded seamlessly into the official government line. In the lounge of the Dom Kino, I watched CNN footage of the bombing of Baghdad, which alternated between ground shots of the exploding bombs as an aesthetic spectacle of fireworks over the city, and the technically depersonalized, video game representations sent back by the "smart bombs" themselves. The chauvinistic good humor of those images of destruction sickened me. Russians in the lounge mistook my sentiments, assuring me that Iraq was armed with Soviet weapons which most definitely would not work. Afterward I sat with my friends in Podoroga's kitchen. We got drunk. Had we spoken out publicly that night against both events, might we have made a difference?

January 1991 marked the end of our era of innocence. The relatively unqualified optimism that underlay our exchanges had depended on the fact that we were moving along with the political current. As a department head at the Institute of Philosophy, Podoroga was now an established figure. Ryklin was an internationally published theorist of Russia's literary and artistic avant-garde and had just been awarded a grant by the Maison des Sciences de l'Homme for philosophical research in Paris. Petrovskaia had left behind her student status and was a published philosopher in her own right. Now a full professor, I had become some kind of Phil Donahue of intellectual exchange, building "bridges" (as Donahue called the live, satellite television dialogues he hosted with Vladimir Posner between citizens of New York and Moscow) over which we intellectuals passed with little bureaucratic difficulty and substantial financial support. The mood of political power was changing, however. Gorbachev had been a cosmopolitan figure, but now "cosmopolitanism" (the code word for Jewishness among Russian anti-Semitic groups) was under attack. Political leaders still played on a global stage, but they felt far less constrained by the opprobrium of a general audience. That was the lesson of the Lithuanian crackdown, and it was the lesson of the war in the Gulf as well. Television, the most powerful medium of political life, showed itself to be vulnerable, on both sides, to appropriation by the "wild zone" of sovereign power—the war zone that I had described in my earliest Moscow lectures on the modern, mass-democratic state. Those lectures had discussed a future crisis of sovereign legitimacy within the superpowers as a consequence of the disappearance of the Cold War enemy. In the USSR in 1991, this crisis was in full swing. It culminated in the abortive coup of August 1991, which sounded the death knell of the Soviet Union as a sovereign form. Circumstances surrounding the August 1991 coup are still obscure, as the version that has been offered to the public leaves several key questions unanswered.63 The accepted narrative is that it was planned by reactionary Soviet officials backed by the KGB, who placed Gorbachev under house arrest in the Crimea and on August 19 made the by now predictable first move of taking over the Moscow television station. 

Vice President Ianaev announced at 6:00 a.m. that Gorbachev was ill, and that he was in charge as head of the "State Committee for the State of Emergency."64 Hundreds of tanks took up key positions on Moscow streets. Yeltsin forces formed an opposition, taking their stand in the Russian White House and using every technological medium at their disposal to challenge the constitutional legality of the emergency decrees. They did not hesitate to call the coup leaders "criminals" and "traitors"—that is, enemies of the true "state," which by "defending" Yeltsin himself appeared to personify. He telephoned George Bush and John Major, receiving assurances that neither the United States nor Great Britain would grant legitimacy to the coup. He used a ham radio frequency to repeat the charge of criminal illegality to the outside world, and was in contact with journalists from Radio Liberty in Munich, the Voice of America, and the BBC.65 Most dramatically, Yeltsin attracted the cameras of foreign reporters with a fiery speech atop one of the army tanks surrounding the White House. Seen on television throughout the world, his speech was ostensibly addressed to those unarmed citizens encircling the White House for its protection who had come out in answer to Yeltsin's appeal, and who, representing "the people," were the symbol of his own democratic legitimacy. In this narrative, which dominated the reports of Western commentators, Yeltsin appeared as "the right person at the right time," almost single-handedly putting a stop to the nefarious leaders of the coup.66 Kagarlitsky has suggested the plausibility of a different version, however. He speculates not only that Gorbachev was a party to the coup from the start, but that Yeltsin, too, had been informed of the plans, and agreed not to intervene in return for guarantees that he would be allowed to stay in power. According to this version, the coup, staged just one day before the compromise Union treaty was to be signed, was meant to ensure law and order in the period of transition to a new political form of power-sharing between Russia and the Soviet Union, and to protect the ruling center against the centrifugal force of non-Russian "nations" for self-determination. But, Kagarlitsky's speculation continues, Yeltsin suddenly changed the scenario by going back on his agreement to remain neutral and, despite all his rhetoric of constitutional legality, in effect staged a countercoup, demanding that "all the power structures on the territory of the republic should be put under the control of his government," an act which, Kagarlitsky notes, was in violation of the constitutions of both the USSR and Russia. Whatever version of the events is correct, their effect was to destroy Soviet legitimacy definitively, initiating a wave of declarations of independence among the republics. On December 8, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus announced that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist, proclaiming a new "Commonwealth of Independent States." On December 25, Gorbachev resigned, and the Russian flag, replacing the Communist hammer and sickle, was raised over the Kremlin. It is not unreasonable to suggest that the Gulf War, too, was evidence of a crisis of sovereign legitimacy, this time for the United States as a world superpower. The crisis was handled by projecting onto a new enemy, personalized in the figure of Saddam Hussein, the same morally absolutist discourse of "good versus evil," freedom versus totalitarianism, that had been used against the Soviet "evil empire" during the Cold War, even though it was Hitler with whom Hussein was explicitly compared.

In fact, President Bush's saber-rattling rhetoric can perhaps be understood as having more to do with reestablishing the legitimacy of U.S. superpower sovereignty in the post-Cold War era than with any actual Iraqi threat. The whole scenario of "Desert Storm," along with "Desert Shield" during the preceding months, was a televised, double-feature replay of the "political imaginary" peculiar to the United States, including its characteristic form of legitimating the use of violence against its enemies. Specifically, Bush's performance of sovereignty was a mythic, monologic reproduction of the spa-

The collaboration we had created was a creature of perestroika, no matter what we might have thought personally of Gorbachev's politics. When the Soviet Union disintegrated, waning power translated into waning interest among certain funders, while others turned, understandably, to more pragmatic projects. War in Yugoslavia made the continuation of our Dubrovnik course impossible. It was almost two years before we met again—time enough to reflect on what we had been living through.

They surrounded us, as we spent time together in the great Red Hall of the Institute of Philosophy with its larger-than-life bust of Lenin (which disappeared overnight), in Elena Petrovskaia's living room, with its soft brown couch and special chair for visitors, in a vodka-warmed forest dacha on an icy night, at a swimming hole near the student dorms one summer evening. There were theater performances, artist's studios, and poetry readings. There was being lost, and found again, in the Moscow metro, sliding and falling on icy city pavements, playing Russian-language tennis at the Lenin Stadium, diving into a nighttime sea in Dubrovnik, squeezing around a table at the Black Swan Armenian cooperative in Moscow, and lingering over the prix fixe at a Chinese restaurant in Paris. We sat at a "round table" on knowledge and power, and at numerous square ones stocked with cake and tea. There were discussions of "technoculture" in the Lenin Hills, "postmodern economics" on a screen porch in Ithaca, "the body without skin" at Taughannock Falls < previous page page_252 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_252.html [21.01.2009 0:35:30] page_253 < previous page page_253 next page > Page 253 Park, and "micropower" in front of Karl Marx's dilapidated green reading chair, preserved under glass at the Marx-Engels Museum on Volkhonka Street. My friends laughed when I described our collective erotics as socialist. But shared physical presence is a kind of communication, and it is conducive to a different intellectual production than is conceived in isolation and communicated through the written word alone. Although it may be packaged and published in the same way, although it may never mention personal experience, its conviction and claim to truth come from a source in addition to the scholarly argumentation in which it is presented. This is the case with the essay "Aesthetics and Anaesthetics," which I wrote as an academic lecture for presentation at conferences celebrating Walter Benjamin's hundredth birthday in 1992. Everything about the lecture, from its politics to its images, was a response to experiences of the previous five years. Although it was delivered in Detroit, Princeton, New York, Madrid, London, and Hong Kong before being presented in Podoroga's seminar in Moscow, it was a part of the Moscow project, and I have included a section from it above in chapter 3. On the one hand, it is an attempt to counter the extreme anti-utopianism of the position of Groys and others, the argument that Stalinism is a logical culmination of the modernist avant-garde which it suppressed.79 On the other, it outlines a philosophical anthropology of modernity deeply influenced by discussions during the five years of our exchange. Tam aware as I tell this story of how often television plays a part, from the televising of the debates of the Congress of People's Deputies in 1989 to the televising of the Gulf War; from the storming of TV stations as a revolutionary act in Eastern Europe to their takeover as an act of government suppression in Vilnius and Moscow. Surely, the live imaging of events and their global dissemination, as well as the speed with which edited images can be televisually inserted into live time, are technologies that produce an intensely powerful political field, one in which virtual reality can have the impact of an actual event. But it would be wrong to conclude that the political uses of these technologies have been a radical break from the past. Some critics want to make of the Gulf War a postmodern watershed, the first "cyberwar" to use Der Derian's description: "a technologically generated, televisually linked, and strategically gamed form of violence," no longer performed on "a territory, a referential being or a substance," but rather on a "simulation": "It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal."81 But the crucial factor in the politics of the image during the Gulf War was not high technology. Rather, it was government censorship, as old as mass media itself.82 It was the same politics that prevailed in the Soviet Union during the Lithuanian crackdown and the August coup83, except that George Bush did not need to storm the TV stations to gain their compliance.84 Similarly, the televised "media war" in early 1991 between Croatia and Serbia, in which both sides showed World War II atrocities perpetrated by the other side, was itself a repetition of the World War II practice of stirring up chauvinism before an invasion. Der Derian does truth a disservice by describing the Gulf War as a simulation. The suffering in this war, as in any war, was inflicted on actual, not virtual bodies, and their pain continued long after the journalists in the pool packed up their suitcases and flew home. If there is a simulation produced by television, it lies on the other side of the apparatus. It is the simulated "whole world" that watches, the virtual collective assembled in cyberspace, of which viewers, sharing the same televisual experience, imagine themselves to be a part. In the case of the Gulf War, the government-controlled media coverage sought to produce a specifically "American" collective identity, patriotic and partisan, confronting an enemy "other" that was less than fully human. But in order to achieve this goal, it was necessary to suppress images of the war, because uncensored coverage of war produces a very different effect. It does so precisely because of that quality of television so often criticized, its capacity to decontextualize the image. When images are not confined by cultural context, including the propagandistic context that governments want to convey, viewers react to the pure physicality of what they see. They respond not with sympathy to the contextualized meaning of the image, but with empathy to the vulnerable human body, all the more visible because of the paucity of interpretive glosses. Sympathy requires a shared cultural horizon, but empathy is a mimetic, physical response to a sensory perception.85 The real danger of uncensored television in times of war is not that people will react to seeing their soldiers dead or wounded, but that they will find images of the human pain and suffering of the enemy intolerable: napalmed children, war prisoners being executed, and, yes, women sobbing in grief at the bombed Amiriya bunker in Baghdad.86 Paradoxically, this physical reaction to the sight of human pain, a concrete and immediate individual experience, becomes the basis for imagining the most general form of virtual collectivity: a humanity that transcends cultural difference. When demonstrators being beaten by the police at the 1968 National Convention of the Democratic Party in Chicago first chanted, "the whole world is watching," they were expressing a cyberdream with extreme utopian appeal. The "whole world" represents a collective dream of a humanity beyond the boundaries of particular cultures, a humanity capable of protesting against culturally authorized suffering wherever it occurs.

Corporeal revolt against culturally sanctioned violence is a common experience in times of war when, despite the ferocity of military training, the body of the soldier often refuses to be patriotic. It vomits involuntarily at mass executions, loses eliminatory control during the terror of battle, refuses in dreams to forget scenes of bodily dismemberment, or succumbs to feelings of erotic love for individuals who belong to the category of enemy. There is a somatic moment in cognition, and the mere fact that perception is mediated by television does not necessarily eliminate its effect.

What is being seized with the TV station is the capacity to frame the image or delete it, to manipulate its meaning through contextualization or to ensure that it never becomes visible at all. This is mass media in its most politically cynical form. But "live" television coverage is always capable of escaping the context, which means that it can always go out of control. The chance of this happening is what threatens the structures of power, and therefore precisely what a democratic media policy needs to defend.

It is striking how timid the "free world" has become since the end of the Cold War. Everyone is for democracy, but no one trusts its institutions. At a conference I attended in Warsaw in June 1990, at which scholars from the United States advised the Polish parliamentary committee in charge of drafting a new national constitution, a model for voting was suggested based on rational choice theory which, by means of a system of multiple ratings of candidates, weighted the results in such a way as virtually to guarantee that no "extreme" candidate could ever win. It was a least-common-denominator of choice, working to the advantage of the candidate whom the largest majority of the people could tolerate rather than anyone they really wanted, and it was far more likely to produce apathy about the voting process than to provide for democracy's guarantee. Controlled democracy is an oxymoron. Democracy in voting, like democracy in media, is about risk, or it is about nothing.

Moreover, these two institutions need each other, for no matter what the images are to which the cybercollective of the "whole world" is exposed, the passivity of media reception limits audience response to the totally inadequate choice of switching the channel. Political institutions provide people with at least some means of active participation. In the present world order these institutions are national. But by seeing past the nation, television audiences perceive the world differently from the view presented to them by state power, and they may become radicalized as citizens as a result. Page 256

They are subversive in their concrete materiality, not because they provide another interpretive or cultural point of view. < previous page page 256 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_256.html [21.01.2009 0:35:33]

The critical power of the empathic body is "aesthetic" in the original meaning of the term.89 The body can sense when reasons have become rationalization and culture is a euphemism for oppression. As a "piece of nature" (Stiick Natur, to use Adorno's term), the body's resistance to cultural domestication sets limits to the validity of arguments honoring cultural difference. It follows that ideology needs to work directly upon the bodily senses in order to contain this rebellious potential. It does so not only through disciplinary techniques (fear of punishment or the internalization of social constraints) but also through sedation and seduction of the body's cognitive power, a set of practices that, as anaesthetics, act as a buffer against the violent shocks of modern life.

The philosophical anthropology that underlies this argument is indebted to the work of Petrovskaia, Podoroga, and Ryklin, although there are significant differences even among these three, and although our work together does not add up to a philosophical "school." As with Foucault, the focus is on the question of power, and the flesh of the body figures as the site of both cultural inscription and individual resistance. But unlike Foucault's analysis, here the body is not understood as a biological force perceived by an alienated consciousness. Rather, the sensory circuit of the body, as a critically perceptive agency, is consciousness. The world of the corporeal senses is the ground of philosophical experience and the source of metaphysical illumination.90 Metaphysics here does not mean above the physical but within it—again, a return to the ancient Greek meaning.91 This metaphysics is materialist in the sense that the truth which it reveals about human beings includes their world—not "world" in the Heideggerian sense of a shared horizon of cultural meaning, but world as it is encountered directly by the cognizing body, experienced by the entire sensory apparatus against the grain of cultural preconceptions. There is an existentialist element in this understanding, indebted in my case to Benjamin and Adorno, and in theirs to Mamardashvili as well. Ryklin speaks of the "irreducibility of corporeal phenomena," which forces us < previous page page_257 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_257.html [21.01.2009 0:35:34]

6.9 Still from Sergei Eisenstein, Battleship Potemkin (USSR, 1926). "to think through the skin."92 Petrovskaia analyzes the techniques of painting that allow Goya and Picasso to reproduce not merely the fact but the corporeal experience of political violence, depicting its horror in a way that undercuts the justifying discourse of the enemy "other." Ryklin investigates the opposite cultural phenomenon, the denial of bodily suffering that characterized the style of "High Terrorism" in Soviet art. When he describes the cheerful scenes of the collective in Stalinist iconography, the "abundant numbers of rejoicing figures," as the "monstrous ecstatics" of "communal bodies," he evokes physically the terror we experience when faced not with state violence, but with the fact that official culture in its most optimistic, utopian form so easily obliterates the pain of individuals who suffer under it.

6.3 Knowledge Production in a Global Economy

When Podoroga came to Cornell in the fall of 1992, his political analysis was bleak: the breakup of the Soviet Union had not eliminated imperial relations but rather multiplied them. Every republic, every nationality was becoming an empire in miniature.97 Ryklin, following a year in Paris, was at Cornell as a Fellow at the Society for the Humanities, and was discovering firsthand the sense of fragmentation and isolation felt by intellectuals who live the internationalism of their beliefs.

When Petrovskaia's parents moved to New York (where her father was working for the Secretary General of the United Nations), she chose to stay in Moscow, newly married to Aleksandr Ivanov, a philosopher originally from Minsk who had joined Podoroga's working group. Petrovskaia and Ivanov came with Podoroga to Cornell to attend a November 68 workshop and round table, "Critical Reflections on Modernity and Postmodernity," held on the occasion of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolutiona Western university being one of the few places left in 1992 where such a celebration might take place.98 And yet the university was ill prepared to handle the new situation. The bafflement began in the planning stage. What word existed to name the foreign participants? If they were no longer "Soviets" and not all "Russians," who were they? And why were they being asked to a conference on Modernity and Postmodernity, from which Western Europeans were largely excluded? The panel sessions were devoted to interpretations of Soviet culture within Western theoretical discourses, leading to debates common enough for the participants, but not, institutionally, for Cornell, where during the Cold War all study of "Eastern" cultures had been relegated to departments of Slavic Studies and Russian Literature, whereas we were contesting the issues within a general theoretical field. 

Given this context, the closing debates were heated, as all sides argued passionately for the centrality of their experience in order to understand what this century had been about.99 < previous page page_260 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_260.html [21.01.2009 0:35:37] page_261 Page 261 6.11 Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid, Ithaca's Most Wanted Painting, 1996, rendered by the artists to accord with the results of a public opinion poll of Ithaca inhabitants. If new narratives were still in confusion, the old ones had lost conviction. A public screening of October, Eisenstein's 1927 film version of the Bolshevik Revolution, introduced the new generation of students to a utopian dreamworld that by their lifetime was well-nigh extinct: the socialist dream of violent, mass revolution seemed indeed a political dinosaur. Nonetheless, celebrate the Revolution we did, with a dancing party featuring rock music from Russia that lasted well into the night. The discussions generated by the workshop did begin to produce a common discursive ground that might make it possible to transcend the old East/West divisions of the Cold War era. But "common ground" among intellectuals remains a space hovering above very mundane realities. In terms of practical existence, the issues were fundamental: For whom were we writing? Was there a common reading public in the wake of the breakup of the East and West blocs, or was intellectual relevance a matter of remaining within one's own linguistic and cultural tradition? In his essay "Back from Moscow, in the USSR," Derrida reflects with disarming frankness: "I ask myself what I am doing with my life today when I travel between Jerusalem, Moscow, and Los Angeles with my lectures and strange writings in my suitcase."100 The life of the "global intellectual" is a recent phenomenon, dating back to the early 1970s, when airports and hotels became the habitat of a new breed of professors who began to orbit the world in the wake of global capital. This trend now sets the standard for competitive performance of mental laborers in general. All of us sense (rightly) that our success depends on global name recognition. To achieve the status of a global intellectual, it is not necessary to saturate national markets, not even one's own. No one speaks of writing for the majority, much less for the masses. It is enough to be known among a tiny but mobile transnational elite, who have inordinate power to replicate locally the hegemony of globally transmitted discourses. If one wanted to be dramatically pessimistic, one might describe this phenomenon of globalization as a membrane that spans the world like an oil slick, thin but tenacious, and capable of suffocating the voices of anyone speaking beneath it. There are thus good political reasons for resisting the global trend. But are the compromises any less in writing self-consciously for a national constituency? Whose interests, in each case, is one serving? For intellectuals in postsocialist countries, these concerns were magnified enormously. At the most basic level, it was a matter of economic survival. Petrovskaia wrote to me from Moscow in March 1992: "Of course, economically life is simply stupid or ridiculous—the most advanced of us receiving about 20 dollars a month. And if you have children, the strain is too great. There is something humiliating about the fact that the best intellectuals can hardly make ends meet. The sudden descent into poverty of Russia's cultural workers was the consequence of "market reform," a euphemism covering over the social turmoil of the economic transition to capitalism that was the stated goal of Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union. In January [21.01.2009 0:35:39] page_262 < previous page page_262 next page > Page 262, Yeltsin lifted government controls on prices, and within days the cost of living soared. This initial hyperinflation was declared beneficial by Western-oriented reformists, who renamed it "repressed inflation," because it eliminated "monetary overhang," that is, the rubles accumulated by working people because there was nothing to buy, leaving them overnight with the opposite problem, that of having nothing to spend.

If there ever was a series of historical events in which, beneath the surface of political struggle, the issues were fundamentally economic, it was those surrounding the demise of "really existing socialism." Ironically, the socialist ideology of economic determinism was discredited just at the point when it could have had compelling explanatory power, whereas, on the level of politics alone, these events must forever appear mysteriously fortuitous. As soon as the Soviet Union disintegrated, economic issues became dominant. The overriding policy concern was not whether incorporation into global capitalism should occur, but how quickly and on what terms. Yeltsin's economic advisor, Egor Gaidar, was a believer in "shock therapy," (Russians used the English term "the big bang") the method of abrupt rupture and sudden transformation promoted by Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs, advisor to Poland's postsocialist government, who had worked in Yugoslavia and Latin American countries before that. Not since the pseudo-science of biological racial difference, generated in the first decade of this century, has Harvard University produced a knowledge discourse with such far-reaching social implications.101 Its rise to hegemony was a prototypical case of intellectual globalization, showing both the power and the vulnerability of such knowledge production, and in this sense it is instructive for all intellectuals whose "space" has become global.

Told as an economic story, the collapse of Eastern European and Soviet socialism loses its heroic dimensions, becoming yet another chapter in the general narrative of the restructuring of global industrialism that occurred [21.01.2009 0:35:39] page_263 < previous page page_263 next page > Page 263, in response to the economic crisis of the 1970s. This crisis was systemic within the Fordist model of industrialization that featured giant firms, centralized production, heavy industrial technologies, and standardized output. The Soviet Union's enthusiastic adoption of the Fordist model in the 1920s and 1930s meant that the crisis, when it came, was experienced in the East and West alike. To cite Charles Maier: The superiority of the Western economies lay not in their immunity to these systemic challenges, but in their capacity to overcome them. 

... Economic difficulties of the 1970s posed harsh alternatives for both East and West. Beset by social conflict and confusion over policy, the West eventually opted for the discipline of the world market. The East, however, retreated from economic reforms it had begun to institute. In retrospect, we can see the [political] collapse of 1989 in that divergence.102 In the West, the "discipline of the world market" was inflicted upon the working class. It entailed tolerating levels of unemployment that had formerly been politically unacceptable, in order to "adjust" to changing industrial technologies and to the "comparative advantages" of underdeveloped countries in the global labor market.103 And it meant curbing spending on social welfare programs in ways that threatened the very existence of the capitalist welfare state. Socialist governments in the 1970s avoided making these painful readjustments—ironically, because loans of overabundant petrodollars from Western banks extended the life of central planning, enabling old-style socialist industrialism to continue in the short run.104 By the 1980s, servicing this debt with hard currency put socialist economies under enormous strain. Exports were required to generate hard currency, but it was Western imports that were in demand. Although the USSR's foreign debt was less onerous than that of Eastern European countries, Soviet imports of everything from U.S. grain to Japanese technology rose significantly.105 What changed for all socialist economies was that they became increasingly entangled—on unfavorable terms—within a global capitalist system that was itself undergoing a major structural transformation. 106 Socialist leaders proved to be remarkably naive in evaluating the political implications of this process. In June 1989, I attended a conference in Moscow organized by the International Herald Tribune on the possibilities for "East-West Economic Cooperation," at which Gorbachev's economic advisor Abel Aganbegyan made a plea for a new U.S. Marshall Plan to restructure the Soviet economy.107 He was giving expression to a widely shared fantasy, based on a serious misreading of economic realities. In the 1950s, motivated by Cold War fears of the spread of communism, the Marshall Plan financed the rebuilding of Western European countries by loans of dollars to purchase the surplus industrial production of U.S. domestic firms. In the 1980s, the United States, itself in debt as an importer of foreign manufactures, was not capable of being the motor force for its own industrial recovery, much less anyone else's. When U.S. Ambassador Jack F. Matlock, Jr., responded to Aganbegyan by saying that investment would depend on economic, not political, considerations, specifically the existence of a "favorable business climate" (weak or nonexistent unions, low corporate taxes, lack of environmental controls) and a "disciplined" (low-paid, non-striking) workforce, he was simply stating the facts of the new situation. The global restructuring of capitalism had fundamentally changed the relationship between the political power of nation-states and the economic power of the world system, clearly to the detriment of state power. Superpower political status no longer translated unambiguously into economic status. 

This was true on both sides. With the end of the Cold War, the new post-socialist regimes hoping to "return to Europe" found themselves at the mercy of IMF debt-rescheduling guidelines developed for the economic restructuring of countries like Mexico and Brazil. The psychological impact of being considered economically a Third World country was humbling, exacerbated politically by the fact that the terms of integration into the global economy questioned the self-evidence of workers' social rights. The IMF guidelines for economic restructuring signaled the end of Keynesianism, the economic policies of which had been the backbone of the Western welfare state, and the rise to hegemony of what was called, without apology, "IMF orthodoxy," the neoliberal tenets of which were proclaimed to be beyond question. Translated into a program for the transition from a planned to a market economy, these tenets were three: stabilization (anti-inflation policies, hard budget constraints, and a convertible currency); liberalization (domestic market competition and export-oriented production in order to establish one's competitive advantage, or "market niche," in the global system); privatization (denationalization and deregulation of industry, downscaling of government programs with the goal of increasing "market efficiencies").108 It was by designing reform programs to meet these goals that Jeffrey Sachs rose to global prominence. The term "shock therapy" refers to the speed of the reforms. The metaphor implies jolting the system into gear through rapid acceleration of the transformation process. Sachs's rhetoric raised a threat of imminent catastrophe if the process was allowed to slow down. In 1991 he enumerated the "enormous risks" of "microeconomic instabilities" that Poland faced, which "could prove deadly to the privatization effort." 109 One year later he wrote: "Russia's post-communist future balances precariously on the knife-edge."110 He did not hesitate to state the reason for the hurry: Speed of implementation was necessary in order to avoid "parliamentary paralysis," that is, to prevent political debate about the social desirability of the transformation.111 At this point Sachs's argument becomes circular. If speed is necessary to avoid political debate, political debate needs to be avoided because it slows down the speed of implementation. Circularity, hardly fortuitous, is the epistemological essence of his project, as shock therapy produces by its speed precisely those problems which the speed of its implementation is designed to defuse: rising unemployment, declining real wages, cutbacks in social welfare, growing disparities of income, drastic increases of poverty, deteriorating health and education—in short, a massive decline in the standard of living of the majority of a country's citizens. It is indeed the World Bank and other international institutions that he is addressing, and their interests in "reform" of the economy are not the same as those of the majority of the country's citizens.113 Sachs's supporters acknowledged these "unfortunate" side effects of shock therapy, but claimed that certain "politically and socially often inconvenient" actions cannot be avoided: "The simple, even if somewhat unfortunate fact seems to be that there is no method of privatization that would be simultaneously fast, economically efficient, and socially acceptable."114 In the absence of arguments to convince the public (as opposed to World Bank economic advisors), the proponents of shock therapy turned to the language of market fundamentalism, stating categorically: "free markets will work": "That is why patience is vital. The harsh economic medicine will ultimately have the desired effect."115 The public was supposed to accept this on faith, no matter how much empirical evidence there was to the contrary.

If the people of formerly communist Europe can endure the hardship that the policies of stabilization, liberalization, and [private-property-] institution-building inflict, they will emerge at the end of the greatest upheaval that any democratic government has ever brought deliberately upon its own people, at the other end of the valley of tears, into the sunlight of Western freedom and prosperity.116 This rhetoric of consolation, the proverbial doctrine that "things get worse before they get better,"117 would be humorous if it did not translate into such tragedy for so many human beings. The rhetoric of high Stalinism, when the masses were told during collectivization to make sacrifices in the present for a time yet to come, to look ahead to the "sunlight" of the future, and to work together to < previous page page 267 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%FE%EB%20%EF%F3I%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_267.html [21.01.2009 0:35:43] page_268 < previous page page_268 next page > Page 268 "accelerate" the economic transformation. Not only does the word "shock" return in a new context. There is repetition as well in the new proliferation of acronyms, the capitalist IMF, GATT, SPA, and EBRD replacing the earlier Soviet NEP, NOT, NKTP, and VSNKh.118 Without blind faith, the "unfortunate" repercussions of radical transition could not be sold to the public.119 When transition experts spoke among themselves, however, they did not use the rhetoric of market fundamentalism. Rather, they prided themselves on pragmatic flexibility, no more wedded to neoliberal orthodoxy than to any other economic school. The language of Sachs and his Harvard-trained supporters is filled with curious expressions" the Gaidar gang," "quick and dirty," "soft big-banger" versus "hard gradualist," making "brave choices," "moving vigorously," and starting "the real game, played for keeps" 120insiders' jargon that sounds only vaguely familiar to this woman author, reminiscent of rough-and-tumble boys' talk, rebellious yet hip, youthful yet powerful, located in U.S. culture somewhere between The Hardy Boys and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.121 A supporter of shock therapy rightly reminds us that it was a "myth" to believe "the hand of Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard economist, is directing everything."122 Yet, in the case of Russia, at the source of this myth were some powerful political realities. When postsocialist government leaders took up the discourse of "shock therapy" and endorsed its principles, they acquired certain practical political benefits. They tapped into the legitimating aura of Western expertise.123 They spoke the language of private property that garnered sympathy from the IMF, the World Bank, and other international pro-capitalist agencies. They stood to gain from the lobbying effect in foreign countries of the shock therapists' persistent appeal for "massive foreign governmental assistance."124 They could cover over their own helplessness in the face of economic decline by saying they were "letting markets work." They could conveniently vacillate between policies of radical government intervention—the paradoxical planning which shock therapy "perversely" demands125—and the extreme neoliberal dictum "The best industrial policy is no policy,"126 which divorced themselves from all responsibility. But more significant than any of these political conveniences was the fact that shock therapy separated decisively two projects that at first appeared to be inextricably linked: the economic project of free markets, and the political project of democratic rule. In this separation, it was democracy that was considered expendable. The goal of instituting capitalism had clear priority.127 The tragedy of this separation was not the destruction of the old socialist economy, but the fact that "Westernizers" in postsocialist governments no longer identified the elimination of socialism with the establishment of principles of democracy.128 In the case of Russia, it meant that neither side, Yeltsin's Westernizing "reformers" nor the anti-Western "hard-liners"—those nationalists and communists who dominated in his parliament—felt themselves necessarily burdened by the encumbrance of democratic procedures.129 In December 1992, a fistfight broke out in parliament over the nomination as prime minister of the pro-Sachs "Westerner," Egor Gaidar. In May 1993, over five hundred people were wounded in a Moscow May Day riot. But it was in October that the most serious crisis to democracy occurred. President Yeltsin's opponents—nationalists, monarchists, Communists—occupied the White House, and, in a strange role reversal of the August coup two years earlier, it was they who declared his actions unconstitutional.130 The October rebels, led by former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoi, whom Yeltsin had removed from office a month before, refused to accept Yeltsin's decree dissolving parliament, calling it a coup d'état—just as Yeltsin had called the executive emergency decrees in August 1991—and they voted to depose him, swearing in Rutskoi as new acting president. Yeltsin responded with force, sending tanks to surround the parliament building. When the opposition refused to give up, he ordered the tanks to open fire. When pro-parliament groups attempted to take over Ostankino, the main Moscow television broadcasting center, violence broke out again. In all, 187 people lost their lives, including 76 noncombatants.131 < previous page page_269 next page > file:///E|/-=%20%CD%EO%F8%EB%20%EF%F3%E 1 %EB%...20Catastrophe/0262024640/files/page_269.html [21.01.2009 0:35:45] page_270 < previous page page_270 next page > Page 270 Such public slaughter had not been seen on the streets of Moscow in the worst days of Stalin's dictatorship. <><><><><><><><><><><><> Of the three members of the Cornell community whom I knew living in Moscow in October 1993, two were shot by stray bullets during the street violence—a statistic sobering enough to induce me to delay my grant to teach as a Fulbright Professor at Moscow's new Russian State University for the Humanities. I arrived in early November. In the six years since my first visit, the city had changed its face. It was not just the blackened facade of the White House that provided a record of events. Throughout public space, the strains of history had left their mark. "For Sale" signs (in English) were hung, replacing party banners, on the crumbling sides of elegant, prerevolutionary buildings. The huge Moscow metro was overburdened by crowds of private citizens using it as a trucking system to transport commodities, large and small, to be sold at improvised street markets, or sequestered within apartments already bulging with new acquisitions. The state stores appeared more dingy and dismal than ever when positioned next to new, private enterprises, gleaming white from floor to ceiling, while workers posted at the entrance performed the Sisyphian task of mopping up the gray-black snow of Moscow streets. As a commodity spectacle, the potatoes and cabbage of the state stores could not begin to compete with the German cheeses, Scotch whiskey, Italian grapes, rippled potato chips, frozen pizzas, and New England lobsters available at these new fairyland-dreamworlds built not for the masses but for an emerging elite whose wealth depended upon foreign connections. Outside their doors, ordinary Moscow women and men stood silently, holding some private possession—baby shoes or an electrical appliance—offered for sale to those with hard currency to exchange. Again and again, the scene was of new extremes of class difference. Chic women in makeup, fur coats, and high-heeled boots shopped at Western department stores and exclusive boutiques, while old women and veterans begged in pedestrian tunnels. The top ten U.S. songs blared out of kiosks selling imported vodka, and men lying drunk on the streets died overnight in the cold. In the metro stations, pornography and body-building posters, for sale from itinerant peddlers, vied for visual dominance over the old propagandistic mosaics from Stalin's time. Despite an initial wave of destruction of Soviet monuments, the public iconography of socialism was simply too pervasive to be removed or covered over. It was left, deteriorating, alongside altars to the new gods of consumerism: Marlboros, McDonalds, Pizza Huts, and the omnipresent signs for Snickers bars. On television, the U.S. serial Santa Barbara was an evening narcotic addicting even the intelligentsia. An American charlatan on a television talk show peddled laxatives (via call-in number) with the claim that they kept the body young. Black BMWs that screeched around street corners were reputed to belong to mafia members from the Caucasus. Pickpockets roamed the city center where tourists were concentrated. Private residences were protected by elaborate electronic devices, telephonically disengaged by uttering a Russian city code name newly memorized each day, taxing my knowledge of Siberian geography enormously. An anti-crime measure, the practice of compulsory registration for foreign residents, renewed Kafkaesque rituals of submission to an incomprehensible bureaucracy. The cavernous Institute of Philosophy where we continued to meet was half-deserted, as researchers took on several jobs to survive. Its loudspeaker, once used for party announcements, now informed philosophers that frozen turkeys (the U.S. 

S. Thanksgiving surplus?) could be purchased in the cafeteria, and that Cuban sugar would be available Friday in bulk. A five-minute walk away, a new Italian restaurant catered to customers with credit cards from foreign banks. Daily, the inhabitants of this capital city of a former superpower endured national humiliation in economic form. In the new private stores, a double cash register system provided exchange in any combination of rubles and dollars, functioning as a constant reminder to customers of the

The dollar, fixed under socialism at an exchange rate of slightly less than one-to-one with the ruble, was worth 2,400 rubles by fall 1993.131 There was no incentive to stop inflation among the new Russian ruling class, whose wealth was stored in foreign banks and hard currency. They had little to gain in the short term from monetary "stabilization." As for "liberalization," its rejection of import substitution policy (closing one's country temporarily to foreign imports in order to develop domestic production to the point that it can compete globally) did not have the desired effect. Rather than establishing new industries that could create a global niche for Russian products, "free trade" encouraged the practice, immediately profitable, of selling raw materials and other already-existing, nonrenewable values in exchange for manufactured imports. 132

Most controversial was the process of "privatization," because through it a new, capitalist class was being created. The initial issuing of ownership vouchers to 150 million private citizens in October 1992 was a move with more ideological than practical success. In fact, those who benefited from privatization belonged to the same Soviet elite that controlled the redistributive machinery under the old system.133 Many members of the nomenklatura took advantage of their insider status in the military-industrial complex to translate political power into economic power, necessarily collaborating with certain groups connected with the second economy from the Brezhnev days, who "more often than not" had a criminal past.134

What was called "mafia-nomenklatura privatization," leading to "casino capitalism," eliminated Russia's economic independence, tying the country irrevocably to the global system, but it did not succeed in reviving domestic production. Critics of shock therapy have argued that this should come as no surprise. Whereas its policies can be counted on to cause unemployment to rise precipitously, "not a single economy has so far proved that shock therapy is leading to an increase of productive investment."135

Moreover, no developed 79 percent of the votes, and formed, together with the Communist Party's 12.35 percent, the largest political bloc. Russia's Choice, the pro-Yeltsin party led by Gaidar, received only 15.38 percent of the votes. At the same time, the voters approved a new Russian constitution that granted the executive new power to overrule the legislature, weakening the prospects for democracy on an institutional level. [137]

My course in Moscow during this time, entitled "The Political Economy of Desire" was intended to encourage critical reflection on the new ideological orthodoxies of postsocialist Russia, and on the alterations of everyday life that were the consequence of the economic transition. I dealt historically with the eighteenth-century origins of the "economy" as a cultural invention, a sublime notion of limitless growth in production and irrational consumer desire only dimly related to today's vision of capitalist economy as a rational and predictable system. Marx's theory of the commodity as fetish was crucial in this context, and I found myself introducing the famous discussion of commodity fetishism from the opening chapter of Marx's Capital to a generation of Russian students to whom the culture of commodities was becoming familiar, but for whom the Marxist critique of this culture was a new intellectual experience.

As for criticizing the deleterious social consequences of capitalism, there was no need to dust off Marx's texts. The works of Adam Smith (and the early writings of Hegel) were explicit in describing the economy's reckless indifference to the fates of what Smith called "the majority of the working poor." [138]

The Russian State University for the Humanities (RGGU) where I was teaching was founded in 1991 with a mandate "to overcome the profound crisis in the humanities in Russia, the result of 70 years of purposeful extermination." [139] Housed, ironically, in the sprawling building of the former School of the Communist Party, the university was free of bureaucratic encumbrances and receptive to academic innovations, including feminist theory, psychoanalytic theory, cultural studies, and visual culture. [140] Yet for all its openness and all the good intentions, the general economic situation created formidable obstacles for this new institution. Due to the dismal exchange rate, non-Russian books were prohibitively expensive, not to mention subscriptions to foreign periodicals. Exposure to professors from abroad was possible only if the latter could pay the hard currency for airfare. [141] Student exchanges were similarly blocked by the monetary imbalance. The painful consequence of the economic transition was a new isolation of Russian academic and intellectual life, and it threatened to function even more prohibitively than was the case when politics, not economics, was the censoring force.

The structural obstacles produced by economic conditions are not impermeable. There has been much innovative cultural production going on in Russia, about which we in the West are not likely to be informed. Underneath the top layers of economic power, small, entrepreneurial projects are now possible, and individual initiatives have made a virtue of the economic chaos. My friends are involved in a new publishing venture, Ad Marginem, that produces critical theoretical texts"Philosophy on the Margins"by Russian authors and Western authors in translation. Page 275

One hears frequently in Moscow that despite all the problems of the present, the young will have a better life. And indeed, the new generation in Russia is optimistic about the opportunities that "market freedom" provides. I do not doubt that market freedom exists. But the global power system of "really existing capitalism" is not its habitat.

146

The political fact is that neither nationalist isolation nor global capitalist integration is equal to the real possibilities of the present. Both alternatives, in accepting the given relations of power, sell the future short. A better future is not going to fall into the hands of the next generation without a struggle. This book is intended to encourage reflection on the new dangers caused not by dreamworlds that placate the masses, but by the fact that in the current system of global power, even the idea that the masses need placating is being tossed away as outmoded. Is there cause to lament the passing of mass dreamworlds? They were compatible with terrifying assemblages of political and economic power: world war machines, machines of mass terror, violent forms of labor extraction. But it was the structures of power, not the democratic, utopian idea, that produced these nightmare forms. As the old dreamworlds dissipate, the power assemblages continue to exist, surviving, indeed thriving, in the new atmosphere of cynicism. Political protest against them today takes bizarre forms. The state is being energetically attacked by those downwardly mobile groups who need its welfare most. Ethnic nationalism is a phantasmagorical political response to a world where the mobility of populations and the mixing of cultures is inescapable. Calls for cultural traditionalism and religious fundamentalism take place incongruously against a backdrop of global communication and globally mediated perceptions that are changing collective fantasy irrevocably. Even notions of cultural hybridity cannot do justice to the contemporary ontological complexities. There is reason for hope, but it may not come from the traditional realm of politics or from academic intellectuals, for that matter, still tied economically and socially to the old structures of power that we have learned to criticize with such sophistication. Indeed, the whole idea of what constitutes critical cultural practice may need to be rethought. The dream of mass utopia defined the cultural project of the twentieth century in both the First and Second Worlds. Pronounced a failure in the Second World, it was purposefully abandoned in the First. But the utopian impulse that once animated mass production and mass consumption is capable of new configurations.

Perhaps it was a mistake, during the years of our collaboration, to presume that these same superpower sites would take the lead in producing a more adequate cultural project to replace it. There are other worlds, and they too have dreams. While "global intellectuals" orbit above, floating from one international meeting to another, and "national intellectuals" carry on a rear-line defense of cultural exceptionalism from their home territories below, there are producers of culture working on another level to open up alternative spaces on the margins, at boundary crossings, at cultural intersections, within electronic landscapes in subaltern worlds that avoid the homogenizing topology of globalization, while taking advantage of its electronic infrastructures and technological forms. If they succeed in developing alternative intellectual practices where First and Second World intellectuals operating within the old models fell short, it will be at least in part because they are able to develop the political potential of the new means of production – computer information networks, hand-held video cameras, music and voice recordings – using them as cultural weapons against the old structures of power that continue to own and contain them.

Oppositional cultural practices, if they are to flourish at all, must work within the present structures. But at the same time, they can and do create new cartographies, the contours of which may have little to do with the geopolitical boundaries that confined culture in an earlier epoch. In these changed landscapes, "the masses," abused object of manipulation by both revolutionary propaganda and commodity advertising, are hardly visible. In ways that diffuse their power but also have the potential to multiply it, the masses are being transformed into a variety of publics – including a virtual global humanity, a potential "whole world" that watches, listens, and speaks, capable of evaluating critically both the culture of others and their own. From the Wall of China to the Berlin Wall, the political principle of geographical isolation belongs to an earlier human epoch. That the new era will be better is in no way guaranteed. It depends on the power structures in which people desire and dream, and on the cultural meanings they give to the changed situation. The end of the Cold War has done more than rearrange the old spatial cartographies of East and West and the old historico-temporal cartographies of advanced and backward. It has also given space to new forms of cultural intervention, which, if successful, may point to the need for a reappraisal of the entire twentieth-century cultural project. Page 278:


In the aftermath of the Cold War, there is an opportunity for new imaginings to occupy and cultivate the semantic field left by the shattering of the Cold War discourse. As long as the old structures of power remain intact, such imaginings will be dreamworlds, nothing more. They will be capable of producing phantasmagoric deceptions as well as critical illumination. But they are a cause for hope. Their democratic, political promise would appear to be greatest when they do not presume the collectivity that will receive them. Rather than shoring up existing group identities, they need to create new ones, responding directly to a reality that is first and foremost objective—the geographical mixing of people and things, global webs that disseminate meanings, electronic prostheses of the human body, new arrangements of the human sensorium. Such imaginings, freed from the constraints of bounded spaces and from the dictates of unilinear time, might dream of becoming, in Lenin's words, as radical as reality itself.
